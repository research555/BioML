Infant gut microbiome composition is associated with non-social fear behavior in a pilot study

Experimental manipulation of gut microbes in animal models alters fear behavior and relevant neurocircuitry. In humans, the first year of life is a key period for brain development, the emergence of fearfulness, and the establishment of the gut microbiome. Variation in the infant gut microbiome has previously been linked to cognitive development, but its relationship with fear behavior and neurocircuitry is unknown. In this pilot study of 34 infants, we find that 1-year gut microbiome composition (Weighted Unifrac; lower abundance of Bacteroides, increased abundance of Veillonella, Dialister, and Clostridiales) is significantly associated with increased fear behavior during a non-social fear paradigm. Infants with increased richness and reduced evenness of the 1-month microbiome also display increased non-social fear. This study indicates associations of the human infant gut microbiome with fear behavior and possible relationships with fear-related brain structures on the basis of a small cohort. As such, it represents an important step in understanding the role of the gut microbiome in the development of human fear behaviors, but requires further validation with a larger number of participants.

Fear—a behavioral response to threat—is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that promotes survival. The emergence of fear is an important component of normal human development. Fear behavior in response to different environmental stimuli emerge on a schedule that appears to parallel developmentally-relevant fitness threats, supporting an evolutionary non-associative model of fear acquisition1,2. Around 6 months of age, infants demonstrate fear processing through discrimination of fearful faces from other facial expressions3–5. Fear of heights, strangers, and strange objects can be reliably detected in the subsequent months6 and behavioral responses increase in intensity until at least 11 months of age, with many fear-evoking paradigms eliciting peak intensities around 12 months of age7. Fear may act as a regulatory or protective mechanism to balance the increase in mobility and exploratory behavior during this time8. This general developmental pattern is observed in different individuals, but the intensity of fear in response to a specific threat can vary with high levels of developmental fear predicting the future emergence of anxiety disorders9,10 while a lack of early fear behavior may be associated with future callous-unemotional traits11.

In this work we show that that 1-year gut microbiome composition (Weighted Unifrac; lower abundance of Bacteroides, increased abundance of Veillonella, Dialister, and Clostridiales) is significantly associated with increased fear behavior during a non-social fear paradigm. Infants with increased richness and reduced evenness of the 1-month microbiome also display increased non-social fear. No relationship is observed with social fear behavior or parental report of fear behavior. Finally, non-significant trends are observed between the microbiome and volumes of the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex, brain regions with important roles in processing threat.

Two observational behavioral assessments, the Mask Task and Strange Situation, were chosen to assess non-social and social fear, respectively. In addition, parents completed the revised Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ-R) which includes a range of fear behaviors both social and non-social. Measures of facial fear, bodily fear, vocal distress, escape behavior, and startle within the Mask Task paradigm were highly correlated, suggesting they tap into the same underling behavioral construct. However, there was little correlation between Mask Task measures, social wariness during the Strange Situation paradigm, and parent report measures of fear on the IBQ-R, suggesting these measures capture different behavioral constructs (Table 1). Behavioral outcomes were tested for associations with 1-month (n = 32) and 1-year (n = 21) microbiome community measures of alpha and beta diversity. Alpha diversity, the diversity of the microbiome within the individual, was analyzed through a principal component analysis of four alpha metrics (Shannon Diversity, Observed Species, Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity, Chao1) to generate Alpha Diversity PC1 and Alpha Diversity PC2 at 1 month and 1 year of age (Fig. 1). At 1 month, Alpha Diversity PC1 appears to captures richness, while Alpha diversity PC2 captures evenness. At 1 year, Alpha Diversity PC1 appears to capture species richness, while Alpha Diversity PC2 captures both evenness and taxonomic richness; Beta diversity, the dissimilarity of the microbiome between individuals, was generated separately at 1 month and 1 year of age through principle coordinate analysis of Weighted Unifrac to generate principal coordinates 1 and 2 at each age.

Social fear assessed through Episode 3 of the Strange Situation paradigm as well as parental report of fear behavior with IBQ-R fear index were not significantly associated with any microbiome measures at 1 month or 1 year of age after Bonferroni correction.

Neuroimaging was conducted at both study visits to assess regions involved in fear circuitry. Using multiple linear regression models with age at scan and sex as covariates, we tested for associations of alpha and beta diversity with a priori brain volume regions of interest involved in fear circuitry: specifically, medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. While none reached the level of significance after Bonferroni correction, 1-month Weighted Unifrac PC 1 was negatively associated with 1-year medial prefrontal cortex volume (p = 0.046, n = 14) and 1-year Weighted Unifrac PC 1 was negatively associated with 1-year amygdala volume (p = 0.034, n = 13) (Fig. 6).

As with our investigation of microbiome effects on fear behavior, we performed a secondary analysis to determine associations with individual genera. There was a significant negative association between Streptococcus relative abundance at 1 month with amygdala volume at 1 month of age after FDR correction (q = 0.021) (Supplementary Table 3). Streptococcus was also negatively associated with 1-month hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex volumes but does not reach FDR significance (p = 0.009, p = 0.012, respectively). Several other genera at 1 month of age were associated with amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex volumes (p < 0.05) at 1 month (Supplementary Table 3) and 1 year of age (Supplementary Table 4). There were no significant associations with 1-year genera and brain volumes at 1 year of age.

To better understand how beta diversity community measures might influence brain development, we also tested each principal coordinate for associations with predicted metagenomic functional ability as determined by Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt)58. The PICRUSt pipeline predicts the abundance of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologs by participant at the collapsed KEGG pathway levels. 1-month Weighted Unifrac PC1 was significantly associated with several KEGG pathways after FDR correction (n = 32) (see Table 2). There were no significant associations with 1-month Weighted Unifrac PC2, 1-year Weighted Unifrac PC 1, or 1-year Weighted Unifrac PC 2 after FDR correction.

Alpha diversity measures, Chao1, Observed Species, Shannon Diversity, and Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity, increased from 1-month to 1-year. Participants with high alpha diversity at 1-month showed the least change while those with low alpha diversity initially had a large increase to 1 year (Supplementary Fig. 1). Similarly, a significant negative relationship was observed between 1-month Shannon Diversity and 1-year Chao1, Observed Species, and Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity as well as 1-month Observed Species and 1-year Chao1 (Supplementary Table 1). Weighted Unifrac principal coordinates were tested for correlation within and between timepoints and none reached the level of significance.

The significant effects we observed could indicate a causal role for the microbiome in fear reactivity and amygdala development, but could also be explained by the microbiome acting as a proxy for another variable. To better understand potential confounders, we tested for associations of medical, demographic, and feeding variables with microbiome measures of alpha diversity and beta diversity at 1 month and 1 year of age as well as 1-year behavioral outcomes. After FDR correction, maternal age at birth was positively associated with 1-month Weighted Unifrac PC2 (n = 32, q = 0.001, estimate = 0.018, Std. Error = 0.004, t = 4.53, CI = 0.01, 0.03, df = 30, r2 = 0.40). There were no significant medical, demographic, or feeding variable associations with 1-year microbiome measures, IBQ-R fear index, Strange Situation response, or Mask Task outcomes. There were no significant relationships between 1-month Weighted Unifrac PC 2 and outcomes of behavior or brain volume to warrant sensitivity analysis with maternal age at birth as a covariate.

Experiments in animal models demonstrate the impact of the gut microbiome on fear behavior and its associated neurobiological substrates24,59–61. In this study, we observed that the human infant gut microbiome is also associated with differences in observed fear reactivity.

While the associations detailed in this study do not prove causality, they provide impetus for future investigations into the complex interplay between the gut microbiome and brain as well as microbiome predictors of later neuropsychiatric pathology. With further research, the gut microbiome may emerge as a key modulator of fear development and as such may become a means to prevent or ameliorate psychiatric disorders and behavioral problems characterized by abnormal fear reactivity.

We recruited 34 infants from UNC and REX Hospitals in central North Carolina as participants in this prospective longitudinal cohort pilot study. Inclusion criteria for participation in the study were vaginal delivery and exclusive breastfeeding until the first study visit at 1 month. Participants were excluded for maternal antibiotic usage two weeks before delivery (including Group B Streptococcal prophylaxis), antibiotics given to the infant before the first study visit, neonatal intensive care unit stay, birth weight <2500 g, gestational age <37 weeks, major maternal medical illness, prenatal drug use, primary language other than English, and fetal ultrasound abnormalities. Prenatal, labor and delivery, and pediatric medical records were reviewed to ensure that participants met study inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participants had two study visits at UNC (median age at visit 1 = 30 days, range 15–59 days; median age at visit 2 = 384 days, range 333–491 days) and one phone interview at 6 months. Data collected at each visit are displayed in Table 3 and include sociodemographic, medical, feeding history, State Trait Anxiety Inventory87, Life Experiences Survey88, fecal sample, Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised89, neuroimaging, Strange Situation90, and Lab-TAB Mask Task91.

See Table 4 for cohort description (sample size may differ between variables due to non-response, or loss to follow-up at 6mo or 1 yr) (binary variables were included only when the least common response was given >20% of the time). Informed written consent was obtained from parent/legal guardian of each participant. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Participating families were mailed a sample collection kit shortly before each visit that included 2 tubes (one for backup) each containing 1 ml Allprotect reagent (Valencia, CA). Parents were instructed to collect ~200 mg of feces from a single soiled diaper, immediately place it in a tube completely submerged in reagent, and bring to the study visit (samples submerged in Allprotect can be stored up to 7 days at 15–25 °C). Once received, the tubes were stored at −80 °C until analysis. All microbiome analysis including DNA isolation, sequencing, and sequencing data analysis was completed in separate batches for 1-month and 1-year samples. DNA isolation was performed as described in92,93. Specifically a portion of the collected stool samples (~200 mg) were combined with 200 mg of 212–300 μm glass beads (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 1.4 ml of Qiagen ASL buffer (Valencia, CA) in sterile 2 2 ml tubes. Bead beating commenced for 5 min in 1-min intervals in a Qiagen TissueLyser II at 30 Hz. Next, samples were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 21000 × g for 5 min. To remove PCR inhibitors, supernatants were transferred to new 2 ml-tubes containing InhibiEx inhibitor adsorption tablets (Qiagen) and vortexed vigorously. After a brief centrifugation, supernatants were aspirated and combined with Qiagen AL buffer and Proteinase K (600IU/μl). After a 10-min incubation at 70 °C, DNA was purified via a standard on-column method using Qiagen buffers AW1 and AW2 as washing agents and eluted in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0).

Sequencing of the generated amplicons targeting the V1-V2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene94–96 plus Bifidobacterium-specific primers in a 4:1 Universal to Bifidobacterium was carried out on the Illumina MiSeq platform as described in57,80. The complete sequences of the primers are available in Supplementary Table 5. Master mixes for PCR amplification contained 12.5 ng of total DNA, 0.2 µM of each primer and 2x KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Amplification commenced with the following steps: 95 °C for 3 min, cycling of denaturing of 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s and a 30 s extension at 72 °C (25 cycles), a 5-min extension at 72 °C, and a final hold at 4 °C. The generated amplicons were purified using AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) and samples were next amplified using a limited cycle PCR program, adding Illumina sequencing adapters and dual‐index barcodes (index 1(i7) and index 2(i5)) (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to the amplicon target. Amplification of each sample commenced with the following steps: initial denaturing at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by a denaturing cycle of 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s and a 30 s extension at 72 °C (8 cycles), a 5-min extension at 72 °C and final hold at 4 °C. The final libraries were again purified using the AMPure XP reagent, quantified and normalized prior to pooling. The DNA library pool was then denatured with NaOH, diluted with hybridization buffer and heat denatured before loading on the MiSeq instrument (Illumina). Automated cluster generation and paired–end sequencing with dual reads were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

After the sequencing run, BclToFastq (Illumina) was used to produce multiplexed paired-end fastq files, which were joined into a single multiplexed, single-end fastq file using fastq-join as described in57,80. After demultiplexing and quality filtering, quality analysis reports were generated with FastQC. Total reads per sample ranged from 5.18 × 103 to 3.15 × 105 at 1 month and 1.38 × 104 to 1.47 × 105 at 1 year. One sample was excluded at 1 year for reads <0.1% of total. Bioinformatics analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data was conducted using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) software96. OTU picking was performed on the quality filtered results using pick_de_novo_otus.py. Chimeric sequences were detected and removed using ChimeraSlayer. Summary reports of taxonomic assignment by sample and all categories were produced using QIIME summarize_taxa_through_plots.py and summarize_otu_by_cat.py. Alpha and beta diversity analysis were performed on the data set using the QIIME routines: alpha_rarefaction.py and beta_diversity_through_plots.py97,98, respectively. Rarefaction was set at 5000 for each timepoint. Alpha diversity is a measure of within-individual diversity while beta diversity measures dissimilarly between individuals. Alpha diversity measures include Shannon Diversity (measure of richness and evenness), Observed Species (richness), Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (phylogenetic measure expressed as tree units observed), and Chao1 (estimate of total OTUs that would be observed with infinite sampling). Principal component analysis of the 4 alpha diversity measures at each age were used as the main predictors in subsequent analyses. Alpha PC 1 and Alpha PC2 explained 78 and 13% of the variance at 1 month and 90 and 5% of the variance at 1 year, respectively. Weighted Unifrac is a beta diversity measure that incorporates the relative abundance of taxa. Principal coordinates analysis of Weighted Unifrac was run separately at each timepoint. Weighted Unifrac PC 1 and 2 explained 53 and 12% of the variance at 1 month and 68 and 13% of the variance at 1 year, respectively. In total, useable microbiome data was obtained for 32 and 21 participants at 1 month and 1 year of age, respectively.

Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) was used to predict metagenome functional content from the 16S rRNA sequencing data58. The PICRUSt pipeline was used to predict the abundance of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologs by participant at the collapsed KEGG pathway levels.

Relevant variables were created based on literature review of important factors that may influence early gut microbiome development or performance on measures of fear behavior. We used linear models to identify environmental variables that could act as confounders due to their association with beta diversity, alpha diversity, or behavioral outcomes. Binary categorical variables were filtered by requiring >20% frequency in the study population. The p values were combined and corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR. Variables with q values less than 0.05 were considered significant. See Supplementary Table 6 for list of variables assessed and how they were created.

The Strange Situation is a well-established paradigm designed to assess infant attachment as the caregiver and a stranger enter and exit the room90. For this study, we analyzed Episode 3 of the Strange Situation to assess wariness or social anxiety of the infants at 1 year of age. In this 3-min episode, the infant played alone with toys on a blanket while their mother read a magazine. For the first minute, a male stranger entered the room and read quietly. During the second minute, the stranger engaged the mother in conversation and gradually directed more attention toward the infant. In the final minute, the stranger sat on the floor and attempted to engage the infant with toys. Video cameras captured wide angle views of the room for later coding.

Before visit 2, mothers were mailed a copy of the Infant Behavior Questionnaire – Revised (IBQ-R)89 to complete and bring to the study visit. Questionnaires were scored to generate a composite fear score to use as a parent reported infant fear behavior outcome at age 1 year.

Strange Situation Episode 3 was divided into three sections (3.1, 3.2, 3.3) and was coded on a global 3-point scale for social wariness toward the stranger during each section. A score of 1 indicates little to no wariness where the infant explores the space, plays with toys, and does not cry, freeze, or cling to the caregiver or caregiver’s chair for more than 5 s. A score of 2 indicates minor to moderate wariness where the infant may demonstrate freezing behavior or clinging to caregiver or caregiver’s chair for more than 5 s but less than 30 s. A score of 3 indicates moderate to marked wariness where the infant demonstrates any crying, persistent clinging to caregiver or caregiver’s chair for more than 30 s or freezes for more than 30 s.

Details for coding of the Mask Task assessment are found in Supplementary Table 7. Briefly, fear in response to each mask was coded for facial fear, vocal distress, bodily fear, escape behavior, and startle response on a 0–3 scale for increasing intensity of fear behavior. No Mask Task data warranted exclusion for interfering parent behavior. All videos for Strange Situation and Mask Task were coded by one person who was reliable with a second coder with >0.8 ICC. Both coders were blinded to microbiome predictors.

Scans were acquired on a Siemens 3 T TIM-Trio scanner (Siemens Medical System, Erlangen, Germany) during unsedated natural sleep at both study visits. Magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MP RAGE) scans and T2 weighted scans were obtained at visit 1 with the following parameters: MP RAGE (repetition time = 1900 ms, echo time = 3.89 ms, 7 degree flip angle, 0.8 × 0.8 × 0.8 mm voxel resolution), 3D T2 weighted (turbo-spin echo sequence, repetition time = 3200 ms, echo time = 406–410 ms, 120 degree flip angle, 0.8 × 0.8 × 0.8 mm voxel resolution). MP RAGE scans were obtained at visit 2 with the following parameters: (repetition time = 1900 ms, echo time = 3.1 ms, 7 degree flip angle, 0.8 × 0.8 × 0.8 mm voxel resolution). A total of 3 infants at visit 1 and 10 infants at visit 2 did not go to sleep or woke up in the scanner (success rate of 91 and 62% respectively).

Images were examined for quality control to exclude scans with motion or imaging artifacts. Two scans failed visual quality control for motion/artifact at 1 month, with no scans failing visual quality control at 1 year of age. The structural processing consisted of brain tissue classification into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. An age specific atlas based expectation maximization segmentation algorithm was employed, operating jointly on T1- & T2-weighted images for visit 1, and only on T1-weighted images at visit 2 utilizing software AutoSeg 3.3.2, NeoSeg 1.0.8, and ITK-SNAP 3.4100. Gray matter was subdivided into 83 regions via a multi-atlas based fusion procedure101 of the Gousias pediatric template database102. In order to ensure a consistent parcellation in both neonate and 1 year old setting, we applied this 1 year pediatric template to all datasets independent of age. Finally, all parcellation results were visually assessed for appropriate parcellation performance. A single scan at 1 month of age failed segmentation QC, resulting in 29 participants with useable brain volumes. No scans at 1 year failed segmentation QC resulting in 16 participants with useable brain volumes. Right and left hippocampus and amygdala gray matter volumes were summed into a single bilateral volume measurement. Total medial prefrontal cortex gray matter volume was generated through the sum of bilateral cingulate gyrus anterior, straight gyrus rectus, superior frontal gyrus, medial orbital gyrus, subgenual frontal cortex, and pre-subgenual frontal cortex.

Linear mixed effect models with random intercept or multiple linear regression models (R 3.5.1) were used to test for effects of alpha and beta diversity on non-social fear behavior, social fear behavior, IBQ-R fear index, and brain volumes. Alpha and beta diversity metrics, Alpha PC 1 & 2 and Weighted Unifrac PC 1 & 2, were all included as multiple predictors in these models. Models with Strange Situation fear outcomes from episodes 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 used a one-level mixed effect model to account for the within-subject covariance of successive episodes. For the Mask Task with both multiple correlated outcomes (facial fear, vocal distress, bodily fear, startle, escape behavior) and multiple episodes (up to 4 different masks presented), we adapted a two-level mixed effects structure to account for the within-subject correlations among different fear outcomes and within-subject but between-mask correlations of the same outcome. Satterthwaite’s methods was applied to approximate degrees-of-freedom103. Multiple linear regression models were used for outcomes involving IBQ-R fear index or brain volume outcomes as well as analyses to identify potential covariates from medical, demographic, and feeding variables associated with the infant gut microbiome. Any identified variables were included as covariates in subsequent sensitivity analyses of relevant brain and behavior testing. Models with brain volume outcomes included age at scan and sex as covariates.

For the secondary analysis of genera associated with non-social fear behavior and brain volumes, bacterial genera were first selected for analysis by the following criteria in order to remove rare outliers and select for genera dominant in microbiome composition: (1) more than 20% of the subjects had non-zero relative abundance for that genus and (2) the 90% quantile of relative abundance for that genus within the cohort was larger than 0.5%104.

For primary analyses (associations between the microbiome and fear reactivity), we used a Bonferroni correction which takes account of both the number of predictors (4 microbiome measures—Weighted Unifrac PC 1 & 2, Alpha PC 1 &2) and the number of models that were run (2 models for the Mask Task, 2 for the Strange Situation paradigm, and 2 for the IBQ-R, with one model examining associations with the 1-month microbiome and one model examining associations with the 1-year microbiome). For secondary analyses (associations between the microbiome and specific brain volumes), we also used a Bonferroni correction which takes account of both the number of predictors (4 microbiome measures) and the number of models that were run (1 model for associations between the 1-month microbiome and 1 month brain volumes, 1 model for associations between the 1-month microbiome and the 1-year brain volumes, and 1 model for associations between the 1-year microbiome and the 1-year brain volumes). Exploratory analyses testing for associations between individual genera and non-social fear reactivity were adjusted using false discovery rate correction, as were our exploratory analyses testing for associations between individual genera and brain volumes.
