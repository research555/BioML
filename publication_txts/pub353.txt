Healthy Gut, Healthy Bones: Targeting the Gut Microbiome to Promote Bone Health

Over the past decade, the use of probiotics to modify the gut microbiome has become a public spotlight in reducing the severity of a number of chronic diseases such as autoimmune disease, diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease. Recently, the gut microbiome has been shown to play an important role in regulating bone mass. Therefore, targeting the gut microbiome may be a potential alternative avenue for those with osteopenia or osteoporosis. In this mini-review, we take the opportunity to delve into how the different components of the gut work together and how the gut-related diseases impact on bone health.

Over a century ago, Metchnikoff had discovered that complex living organisms, now known as microbes, were living symbiotically within the human gut (1). However, their contribution to human health and disease remained understudied. Fast-forward to the past decade and we have seen the gut microbiome taking center stage in various diseases. This has been due to the advance in cutting-edge technologies such as 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and shotgun metagenomics. Numerous pre-clinical studies now demonstrate that the diversity of the gut microbiome influences a wide range of diseases including autoimmune disorders (2–4), diabetes (5, 6), obesity (7, 8), cardiovascular disease (9, 10), and cancer (11, 12). Interestingly, a growing body of evidence suggests that reintroducing ‘good’ bacteria to the microbiome in the form of probiotics can dampen the severity of disease (13, 14). Recently, a new interdisciplinary field bridging the study of gut microbiome and bone biology, known as ‘osteomicrobiology’ has emerged. Over the past couple of decades, various groups have documented the influence of the gut microbiome on bone health and disease.

While the lion’s share of the research on bone biology has focused on therapeutics that can directly target the bone to prevent or treat osteoporosis, such as bisphosphonates, it is becoming apparent that the gut may have indirect effects in maintaining bone health. Thus, targeting the gut may be an attractive alternative therapy. In this brief review, we briefly discuss the importance of the gut in maintaining body homeostasis. Next, we discuss in more detail the interactions between the gut and the bone by exploring emerging mechanisms that have come to light in recent years.

The gut is one of the largest organs in the body. As part of the digestive tract, its main goal is to absorb vital nutrients into the bloodstream in order to maintain energy for cellular and body functions. However, in addition to resident gut microbiota (GM), the food and drinks we consume consist of many foreign pathogens/toxins; therefore, without a defense barrier within the gut, critical and complex functions in the body becomes compromised. Thus, to protect the body, there are multiple defense barriers inside the gut. One of the most important barriers of the gut is a single layer of tightly-packed intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), which act as a physical barrier that separates the outside environment from the inside ‘sterile’ organs of the body (20, 21). These IECs are connected via intercellular junctions composed of three junctions; tight junctions (TJs), adherens junctions (AJs), and desmosomes. These junctions work together to assist with selective transport of ions across the epithelial layer and to also protect the integrity of the epithelial layer. To further aid the integrity of IECs, specialized cells among the epithelial layer known as goblet cells secrete mucin to add and maintain a layer of mucus (22). This acts as a biochemical barrier preventing GM and pathogens from directly interacting with the epithelium. The mucus layer is subdivided into an inner and outer mucus layer, in which the GM exist in the outer layer consisting of ~104 bacterium from over 100 species resides (23). Despite the detrimental effects the GM potentially poses to body, when kept at homeostasis, the GM plays an essential role in gut functionality by aiding the digestion of foods that the gut itself cannot process (23). Finally, below the epithelium is a host of immune cells, which act as a third line of defense to prevent the GM from entering the systemic circulation. These gut immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells and B cells, are housed within gut associated lymphoid tissues such as Peyers Patches or scattered throughout the lamina propria (24, 25) ( Figure 1 ).

During inflammatory disease states, the intestinal barrier can become compromised, increasing intestinal permeability. This makes the body susceptible to foreign particles or GM entering into circulation thereby exacerbating inflammation (26–28). This term is also commonly known as a ‘leaky gut’. It was recently demonstrated in a pre-clinical model of RA that the TJ protein, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, which is known to stimulate the opening of TJs, was significantly increased, leading to inflammation. When ZO-1 was inhibited using a zonulin antagonist, inflammation in RA was markedly dampened (29). In addition, increased intestinal permeability has also been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to dysregulation of the pre-dominant AJ protein, E-cadherin (30). Metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity have also been linked to increased intestinal permeability, which again is involved in further increasing inflammation (31, 32). Besides direct dysregulation of intercellular junctions, a reduction in the protective mucus layer secreted by goblet cells is also known to cause a breakdown of the barrier integrity allowing for GM to interact and pass through the IECs, which is one of the hallmarks of IBD (33). Interestingly, it was recently shown that the diversity of GM can also affect the integrity of the intestinal barrier and inflammation. With accumulating evidence over the years, restoring or balancing the GM has become an attractive therapeutic avenue in preventing increased intestinal permeability and dampening inflammation. Reintroducing ‘good’ bacteria by supplementing diets with probiotics has been heavily investigated in both mice and human, in which the supplementation of probiotics has been shown to restore the GM and reduce disease severity. For example, increased dietary choline (9) (obtained from foods such as eggs) and carnitine (34) (from red meats) can cause atherosclerotic-cardiovascular disease via the gut microbiota-derived metabolite TMA which converts into TMAO in the liver. By administrating Lactobacillus, TMAO levels were reduced, thereby reducing the development of atherosclerosis (35). Furthermore, diabetes has been shown to shift the abundance of two dominating bacterial phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes that leads to increased disease severity. Supplementation with Lactobacillus was shown to reduce inflammation (36, 37). However, with a biased focus now on the effects of probiotics and how it may reduce inflammation, many studies now fail to also investigate whether administering probiotics reduces inflammation due to a restoration in intestinal permeability and immune cells in the gut. Thus, it would be beneficial to measure all three components (GM, immune cell, and intestinal permeability) when intervening with probiotics in gut-related diseases.

In the past two decades, gut-related inflammatory diseases have been linked to a decrease in bone mass, suggesting that the gut may be interlinked with the bone. Recently, it was shown that people with osteoporosis had significantly higher microbiome diversity compared to healthy individuals, specifically in the abundance of Firmicutes (38). In line with this, another clinical study comparing healthy individuals, people with osteopenia and patients with osteoporosis, showed that the severity of bone loss was correlated to the diversity of the gut microbiome (39). In addition, a clinical study conducted in elderly women with low bone mineral density proposed that restoring the microbiome with supplementation of probiotics reduced bone loss (40). Although, the use of probiotics may be a viable therapeutic option, more investigation on how they influence bone biology is warranted for any major changes for treating bone defects. For example, in a recent clinical trial, it was shown that probiotics had no effect on hip bone mineral density, but rather showed a reduction in femoral neck bone mineral density (41). Therefore, studies in pre-clinical mouse models are critically important to directly test how changes in the GM mechanistically impacts the bone.

The dysregulation of gut homeostasis can result in an inflammatory immune phenotype. This includes an increase in interleukin IL-17 producing TH17 cells. Studies have shown that an increase in TH17 cells and IL-17 in the BM promotes bone degradation by stimulating the differentiation of OCs in the BM (63, 64). The Pacific group investigating the role intestinal immune cells play in bone remodeling in the setting of hyperparathyroidism (65). They demonstrated that in mice with microbiomes enriched with segmented filamentous bacteria, parathyroid hormones expanded the population of gut TH17 cells which egressed out of the gut, into circulation, migrating into the BM to cause bone degradation (65). To show egress of intestinal TH17 cells, they inhibited sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) receptor-1 with an FTY720 antagonist, which prevents the egress of lymphocytes from the mesenteric lymph nodes and showed a decrease in BM TH17 cells and bone degradation. Furthermore, to show specifically the importance of TH17 cell migration into the BM, they showed that the chemoattractant CCL20 was upregulated in the BM, which acts to guide TH17 cells. When they administered neutralizing anti-CCL20 antibody, the number of intestinal TH17 cells were unaltered but it prevented the increase in TH17 cells in the BM as well as a reduction in bone loss. Furthermore, they also differentiated TH17 cells from isolated splenic T cells from IL-17A-eGFP reporter mice, transplanted into recipient mice and counted GFP+TH17 cells after inducing bone loss with infusion of parathyroid hormones ( Figure 2C ).

The inter-disciplinary roles between gut and bone has increasingly garnered attention in those in the field of bone biology. From knowledge gathered so far, it seems that restoring the balancing in GM using probiotics or prebiotics may be beneficial in restoring bone health. However, there are still many questions to be answered before the use of probiotics should be recommended to the aging community who are more susceptible to osteopenia. This will require a multi-disciplinary approach where microbiologists, immunologists, gastroenterologists, computational scientists, and the respective disease experts to work together to find the best approach to cure gut-related diseases.
