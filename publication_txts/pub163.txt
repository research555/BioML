Peppermint oil effects on the gut microbiome in children with functional abdominal pain

Peppermint oil (PMO) is effective in the treatment of functional abdominal pain disorders, but its mechanism of action is unclear. Evidence suggests PMO has microbicidal activity. We investigated the effect of three different doses of PMO on gut microbiome composition. Thirty children (7–12 years of age) with functional abdominal pain provided a baseline stool sample prior to randomization to 180, 360, or 540 mg of enteric coated PMO (10 participants per dose). They took their respective dose of PMO (180 mg once, 180 mg twice, or 180 mg thrice daily) for 1 week, after which the stool collection was repeated. Baseline and post‐PMO stools were analyzed for microbiome composition. There was no difference in alpha diversity of the gut microbiome between the baseline and post‐PMO treatment. Principal coordinate analysis revealed no significant difference in overall bacterial composition between baseline and post‐PMO samples, as well as between the PMO dose groups. However, the very low abundant Collinsella genus and three operational taxonomic units (one belonging to Collinsella) were significantly different in samples before and after PMO treatment. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was lower in children who received 540 mg of PMO compared to the 180 mg and 360 mg dose groups (p = 0.04). Network analysis revealed separation between pre‐ and post‐PMO fecal samples with the genus Collinsella driving the post‐PMO clusters. PMO administration appeared to impact only low abundance bacteria. The 540 mg PMO dose differentially impacted the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. A higher dose and/or longer duration of treatment might yield different results.



Mint plants have been used for thousands of years as medicinals. 1 Peppermint oil (PMO) is obtained by steam distillation from peppermint leaves. PMO is commonly used to treat functional gastrointestinal conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome and dyspepsia. 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 The majority of evidence suggests that PMO is effective in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 How PMO exerts its beneficial effect is less clear; generally, it has been ascribed to its ability to act as an antispasmodic. 7 However, PMO, like several other essential oils, also has been shown to have antimicrobial, antifungal, and even antiviral effects; however, these studies have been carried out primarily in vitro or in rodents. 7 , 8 , 9

In a recent study, we investigated the effect of three different doses of PMO (180, 360, and 540 mg) on its pharmacokinetics in children. 10 Given the use of PMO to treat functional gastrointestinal conditions, we carried out the study in children with functional abdominal pain. 10 The doses studied were based on our previous pilot trial of PMO in children. 11 As part of that dose ranging study, 10 stools were collected to investigate the effect of PMO on the gut microbiome composition in the children, with the primary outcome being the detection of a significant change in gut microbiome composition. Studying a dose range allowed us also to investigate the microbiome response to different doses of PMO. We hypothesized that PMO would impact gut microbiome composition and that there would be a dose‐response impact on gut microbiome composition.

Children 7–12 years of age with functional abdominal pain, as defined by pediatric Rome III criteria, were recruited from primary and tertiary (pediatric gastroenterology) care within the Texas Children’s Hospital healthcare network based in Houston, Texas, USA, which is the largest pediatric provider in the area. 12 Children with functional abdominal pain were studied (as opposed to those with irritable bowel syndrome) based on the request from the funding agency. Informed consent was obtained from parents and assent was obtained from children. The study was approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board. The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03295747).

During the baseline (prior to PMO) period, participants who passed screening maintained daily validated pain and stooling diaries for 2 weeks. 14 , 15 Children self‐reported the number and severity of pain episodes on a 0–10 scale with 10 being the most severe. 14 The number and type of stools passed per day was recorded using the Bristol Stool Scale. 15 Children also completed the Rome III Diagnostic Questionnaire for Pediatric Functional GI Disorders. Confirmation of the diagnosis of functional abdominal pain was based on evaluation of the pain and stool diaries. 13

The decision to study 10 participants per dose was based on the results of our pilot study. 11 Participants were instructed to continue their usual diet during the baseline period and during administration of PMO.

Prior to administration of PMO, children collected a stool sample at home using a self‐sealing container which then was kept frozen and delivered to our laboratory via courier along with the pain and stool diary. Participants subsequently came to the Children’s Nutrition Research Center and were randomized (www.randomizer.org) to receive one of three doses of PMO (Pepogest; Nature’s Way Products, LLC, Lehi, UT): 180, 360, or 540 mg. A pharmacist provided the PMO to the investigators based on the results of the randomization scheme. Because the investigator and participant knew how many capsules were ingested, they were not blinded to the dose received. The PMO was purchased from the manufacturer and all capsules were from the same lot number. They received their first dose of PMO and then were sent home where they continued to ingest their assigned dose of PMO daily for 1 week (180 mg once, twice, or thrice daily). The PMO was taken with the appropriate meal (breakfast; breakfast and dinner; breakfast, lunch, and dinner). They recorded the daily intake of PMO capsules and any adverse events (e.g., heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux symptoms). During this time, they again kept the pain and stooling diary and collected a stool sample during days 6 to 7 of PMO ingestion. The stool sample, PMO pill container, and pain and stool diary were returned via courier. Stool samples were stored at −80°C until further processing.

Microbial DNA was extracted from the stool samples using the MoBio PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer recommendations. The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was performed following the standard Illumina sequencing protocol, as previously described. 16 Briefly, the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the NEXTFlex V4 Amplicon‐Seq Kit 2.0 (Bioo Scientific, Austin, TX) and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) platform, yielding 2 × 250 bp paired‐end reads (median reads per sample = 46,272). Two negative controls (no template PCR controls) also were sequenced along with the samples to monitor the potential background noise (both negative controls had fewer than 500 reads post‐quality filtering and were excluded from further analysis).

The Illumina‐sequenced paired‐end fastq files (i.e., raw sequences) were demultiplexed (by sample) using the Illumina MiSeq Reporter analysis software. Primers were removed using cutadapt. 17 The sequence data then were imported into QIIME 2 (version 2019.10) for processing. 18 Denoising and filtering of the sequences were completed using the DADA2 (version 1.16) pipeline. 19 Any features (i.e., the products of DADA2 denoising) with less than 32 nucleotides length were filtered out of the sequence table. Chimeric sequences were removed using vsearch (version 2.7.0). 20 Sequences were clustered de novo into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% identity using the QIIME 2‐VSEARCH plugin. Taxonomy was assigned to the sequences using VSEARCH against the SILVA (version 13.2) reference database. 21 Any unassigned and nonbacterial sequences (e.g., archaea, chloroplast‐derived, and mitochondrial, etc.) were removed from the data before proceeding with analysis.

The quality‐filtered feature (sequence) table, taxonomy table, representative sequences file, and tree file generated using the QIIME2 pipeline were imported into the phyloseq R‐package (version 1.32.0) for subsequent analysis. 22 We performed microbiome analyses in a rarefied (i.e., subsampled without replacement) read count table where the samples were rarefied at 9643 reads (the lowest read depth in the dataset) to account for differing read depths across samples. 23

We calculated the relative abundance of bacterial taxa across samples at the phylum, family, genus, and OTU levels. Alpha diversity, which measures the richness and evenness of the microbial community in a sample, was calculated using the Shannon and Simpson indices. Beta diversity, which measures the similarity (or dissimilarity) of the microbial community composition between samples, was characterized using the Bray‐Curtis index. Additionally, beta diversity was characterized by the Aitchison distance, 24 which accounts for the compositional nature of microbiome data, following the centered log‐ratio transformation of the read counts. 25 Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and principal component analysis (PCA) plots were used for visualization of Bray‐Curtis and Aitchison distance data, respectively.

The classification of enterotypes to the taxonomic profiles generated from our samples was performed using the webserver https://enterotypes.org/. Enterotype (clusters of individuals with similar microbiome composition) assignments were based on the classifier trained on stool samples from the Human Microbiome Project and MetaHIT studies. 26 , 27

The genus level abundance table first was normalized within each sample to the sum of all counts to get the relative abundance. The relative abundances of each genus then were transformed into 10 quantiles across all samples. The subject‐genus tuples with their respective quantiles then were imported into Cytoscape 3.8.2. 28 The subjects and genera were interpreted as nodes and the quantiles as weights of the connecting edges. Additional statistical information about the genera discriminatory power between the pre‐ and post‐PMO samples (Wilcoxon p value) was imported into Cytoscape. In Cytoscape, the “Edge‐weighted Spring Embedded Layout” algorithm with the quantiles as weights was used to generate network layouts for various slices of nodes/edges combinations. We included the network generated using only genera that were present in at least five samples, had a Wilcoxon p less than or equal to 0.05 between pre‐ and post‐PMO samples, and with abundance/edges that remained after removing the lowest 0, 0.1, and 0.2 quantiles.

Overall differences in continuous variables between groups were compared using the Kruskal‐Wallis test. Differences in categorical variables between groups were compared using chi‐square or Fischer’s exact test as appropriate. Average pain severity and frequency per day were calculated as the average of all pain assessments.

Microbiome differential abundance analysis was performed using the traditional Wilcoxon rank sum test or Kruskal‐Wallis test. We also used the R package analysis of variance (ANOVA)‐Like Differential Expression version 2 (ALDEx2), which takes into account sample variation and compositional nature of microbiome data for differential (relative) abundance analysis. 32 Benjamini‐Hochberg correction was applied to the control false‐discovery rate (FDR) for multiple hypotheses testing. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

There was a statistically, but not clinically, significant difference in mean age between the three PMO dose groups (Table 1). There were no differences among the groups in the proportion of girls, body mass index, race, or ethnicity.

No differences were noted among the dose groups in mean abdominal pain severity, number of abdominal pain episodes per day, or number of stools per day at baseline, or while taking PMO. When assessing the cohort (n = 30), mean pain severity was greater during the baseline period than during PMO treatment (p = 0.004) with the 540 mg dose group showing a significant decrease in pain severity (p = 0.04). No differences among dose groups were noted regarding the number of pain episodes. The number of stools passed per day for the cohort (n = 30) tended to be less during the PMO treatment period (p = 0.05). No adverse events were noted during the study related to administration of PMO. Percent compliance with PMO ingestion did not differ among groups (92 ± 16%, 87 ± 14%, and 91 ± 7% for dosing groups 180, 360, and 540, respectively; p = 0.30).

We found no significant difference (Wilcoxon rank sum test p > 0.05) in the Shannon diversity (Figure 1a) or Simpson diversity (Figure 1b) metrics between baseline and post‐PMO samples. However, the variance of diversity metrics in the baseline samples was significantly greater than the post‐PMO samples (p < 0.001) with both diversity estimators (Figure 1c,d). Alpha diversity was not associated with age, height, or body mass index (Figure S1) or with sex, race, or ethnicity of the participants (Figure S2).

There was a decreasing trend in alpha diversity in the 540 mg PMO dosing group compared with the 180 and 360 mg groups (for both Shannon and Simpson indexes; Figure 2a,b), but the values did not achieve statistical significance after FDR correction. There was no difference in the diversity by either metric comparing baseline and PMO results (Figure 2a,b).

The PCoA ordinations using the Bray‐Curtis dissimilarity index revealed no significant difference (Adonis p > 0.05) in bacterial composition between baseline and post‐PMO samples as well as between the PMO dose groups (Figure 3). The overall heterogeneity in community composition across samples at baseline was relatively higher (with respect to the median profile), but not statistically significant (Wilcoxon rank sum test p > 0.05), from the post‐PMO samples (Figure 3b). Like the Bray‐Curtis result, PCA of the Aitchison distance using centered log‐ratio transformed data also found no significant difference (Adonis p > 0.05) in the community composition between baseline and post‐PMO samples (Figure S3).

We found only one categorical variable (ethnicity) that seemed to be related to the microbial community composition at baseline (Adonis p < 0.05) via univariate analysis (Table S1). However, the homogeneity test of dispersion suggested that the difference could potentially be because of sample dispersion (Betadisper, p < 0.05). Additionally, the effect of ethnicity on the community composition was not significant via multivariate analysis (see Table S1 for details).

Because we did not detect any significant difference in the microbial community composition (beta diversity) of our samples stratified by treatment groups with the reported race, ethnicity, and sex of the children, we did not expect demographics to be a confounder when identifying taxa specific to baseline and post‐PMO samples. Thus, demographics were not used in identifying taxa.

Both baseline and post‐PMO gut microbiome were dominated by two bacterial phyla, Firmicutes (mean relative abundance across baseline samples = 47%, post‐PMO = 46%) and Bacteroidetes (baseline = 43%, post‐PMO = 46%; Figure 4a). The major bacterial families reported were Bacteroidaceae (baseline = 27%, post‐PMO = 30%), Lachnospiraceae (baseline = 21%, post‐PMO = 18%), Ruminococcaceae (baseline = 19%, post‐PMO = 18%), Prevotellaceae (baseline = 10%, post‐PMO = 8%), and Rikenellaceae (baseline = 4%, post‐PMO = 5%; Figure 4b). The genera Bacteroides (baseline = 27%, post‐PMO = 30%), Prevotella 9 (baseline = 8%, post‐PMO = 7%), Bifidobacterium (baseline = 5%, post‐PMO = 4%), Faecalibacterium (baseline = 5%, post‐PMO = 5%), Alistipes (baseline = 4%, post‐PMO = 5%), and Blautia (baseline = 3%, post‐PMO = 3%) were dominant in the participants before and after PMO treatment (Figure 4c).

No significant differences among the PMO dose groups (180, 360, and 540 mg) were found in mean relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum, family, or genus levels (FDR‐corrected Kruskal–Wallis p values > 0.05). Similar results were obtained with ALDEx2. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes represented more than 90% of the total bacterial community in the dose groups (Table S2). The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was lower in children who received 540 mg of PMO compared to the 180 and 360 mg dose groups (chi‐square test p = 0.04; Figure 6a). Family level bacterial relative abundance is summarized in Table S3. Although none of the genera were differently abundant among the dosing groups, Bacteroides was the most dominant genus across the groups (mean relative abundance in 180 mg group = 28%, 360 mg = 22% and 540 mg = 41%), followed by Prevotella and Bifidobacterium (for details see Table S4).

Based on the variation in relative abundance of the bacterial taxa, we identified two enterotypes: Bacteroides‐enriched (80%) and Firmicutes‐enriched (20%) in our samples (n = 60). Bray‐Curtis dissimilarity‐based PCoA analysis of the enterotypes revealed two separate clusters of samples in both baseline (Figure S4A) and post‐PMO (Figure S4B) samples. We further found a transition of the enterotypes (Bacteroides to Firmicutes and vice‐versa) from pre‐ (baseline) to post‐PMO treatment in six subjects. Seventeen percent of the participants whose gut microbiome were Bacteroides‐enriched at baseline transitioned to Firmicutes‐enriched enterotype after PMO treatment, whereas only one participant with Firmicutes‐dominant gut microbiome at baseline transitioned to Bacteroides‐dominant type upon PMO treatment. A subgroup analysis of the Bacteroides‐dominant samples, after excluding those which transitioned from one enterotype to another in post‐PMO treatment, found no significant differences in diversity and composition by PMO treatment (Figure S5) and dose (Figure S6).

In the present study, we characterized the gut bacterial microbiome of children with functional abdominal pain before and after treatment with different doses of PMO. Although the composition of the gut microbiome overall did not differ significantly between baseline (untreated) and after treatment with PMO, abundance of some bacteria (e.g., Collinsella) differed significantly before and after PMO treatment. In addition, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was lower in children who received 540 mg of PMO compared to the 180 and 360 mg dose groups. The human gut microbiota is mostly composed of these two phyla that represent greater than 90% of the total community. 27 In addition, network analysis revealed separation between pre‐ and post‐PMO fecal samples with the genus Collinsella driving the post‐PMO clusters.

Strengths of the study include the use of a well‐characterized clinical cohort, a trial in which each participant acted as their own control (providing pre‐ and post‐PMO treatment stool samples), expertise in microbiome studies, and following well‐established protocols derived from the Human Microbiome Project. As noted above, the impact of PMO on the human microbiome has yet to be studied in adults, much less in children. Our findings provide the first benchmark information about the effect of PMO (and its dosing) on gut bacterial community and suggest that, at the doses studied, the clinical benefit of PMO may not be mediated through changes in gut microbiome composition. The study duration should have been long enough to detect potential changes in microbiome composition based on previous (in vitro and rodent) studies of the effect of PMO on gut bacteria. 7 , 8 , 9 Further studies using a multi‐omics approach (microbiome, metabolomics, and metaproteomics) may provide new information about how PMO exerts its beneficial effects in functional disorders and potentially reveal targets for manipulation for prevention or management of the associated gastrointestinal symptoms.
