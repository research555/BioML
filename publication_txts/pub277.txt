Comparative Gut Microbiome Differences between Ferric Citrate and Calcium Carbonate Phosphate Binders in Patients with End-Stage Kidney Disease

Gut dysbiosis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may induce chronic inflammation and increase morbidity. Phosphate-binding agents, generally used in patients with CKD, may potentially change the composition of the gut microbiota. This study aimed to compare the microbiota composition in hemodialysis patients treated with ferric citrate or calcium carbonate. The stool microbiota was investigated in hemodialysis patients treated with ferric citrate (n = 8) and calcium carbonate (n = 46) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing profiling using linear discriminant analysis of effect size. Further predictive functional profiling of microbial communities was obtained with Tax4Fun in R. Hemodialysis patients treated with calcium carbonate had a significantly reduced microbial species diversity (Shannon index and Simpson index) and an increased microbial alteration ratio compared with patients treated with ferric citrate. A distinct microbial community structure was found in patients treated with ferric citrate, with an increased abundance of the Bacteroidetes phylum and a decreased abundance of the phylum Firmicutes. Members of the order Lactobacillales were enriched in patients treated with calcium carbonate, whereas taxa of the genera Ruminococcaceae UCG-004, Flavonifractor, and Cronobacter were enriched in patients treated with ferric citrate phosphate binder. In conclusion, Ferric citrate therapy results in a more diverse microbiome community compared to calcium carbonate therapy in hemodialysis patients with phosphate binder treatment. The gut microbiome reflects the phosphate binder choice in hemodialysis patients, further affecting the physiological environment in the gastrointestinal tract.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are often treated with oral phosphate binders such as iron or calcium-containing phosphate binders to control hyperphosphatemia [1]. Oral phosphate binders were used to prevent the dietary phosphate absorption within the gastrointestinal tract by exchanging an active cation with anion phosphate to make a non-absorbable compound excreted in the feces [2]. Long-term treatment could lead to gut microbial composition changes by lowering the intestinal phosphate burden [3,4]. However, the influence of iron and calcium-containing phosphate binders on the gut microbiome is still unknown. Different groups of phosphate binders that can act differently on the gut microbiome have not been investigated.

An increased microbiome diversity was observed after ferric citrate treatment in a CKD animal model. Moreover, ferric citrate treatment increased levels of tryptophanase-possessing bacteria (Verrucomicrobia, Clostridiaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae) [5]. However, as the gut microbiota of rats and humans are different, the impact of ferric citrate therapy in hemodialysis (HD) patients warrants further investigation. Therefore, this study aimed to explore and compare the biodiversity and composition of the gut microbiome communities in HD patients with two different phosphate binders treatment (ferric citrate versus calcium carbonate). The study findings could potentially contribute to integrating personalized medicine in phosphate binder treatment.

From August 2016 through September 2017, 85 participants were recruited from the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital HD unit. Eligible participants were aged between 30 and 80 years and received regular HD three times per week for more than 90 days. Each HD section was 3.5–4 h with high-flux dialyzers, with a blood flow rate between 250 and 300 mL/min, dialysate flow of 500 mL/min, and single pool Kt/V was more than 1.2 per week. Participants with partial or total colectomy or participants who were prescribed antibiotics within three months before enrollment were not enrolled in our study. Participants who used more than one type of phosphate binder were excluded (n = 31). Fecal samples were collected for fecal microbiota analysis by high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of ferric citrate (n = 8) and calcium carbonate (n = 46) users. All participants were treated with the single phosphate binder (ferric citrate or calcium carbonate) for at least two months.

The study protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital (KMUHIRB-E(I)-20160095 approved on 8 August 2016 and KMUHIRB-E(I)-20180118 approved on 26 April 2018), and all participants provided written informed consent.

Sociodemographic data, age, sex, dialysis vintage, arteriovenous shunt type, medical history, medications, and biochemical data were obtained for all participants from electronic health care system records. The definition of hypertension was 140/90 mmHg or higher or taking antihypertensive drugs. Diabetes was defined as HbA1C 6.5% or higher or taking antidiabetics. History of dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease was based on physician diagnosis. Blood samples were obtained after overnight fasting through the arteriovenous fistula or graft immediately before their scheduled HD session at a single midweek dialysis session. Biochemical data for HD patients included serum values for hemoglobin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ion calcium, phosphate, magnesium, parathyroid hormone, and aluminum from routine blood samples obtained less than 30 days before stool sample collection. A licensed dietitian also recorded a modified short-form food frequency dietary questionnaire.

The stool samples were frozen immediately and delivered using cooler bags within 24 h to the laboratory (Germark Biotechnology, Taichung, Taiwan). DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and stored at −80 °C for 16S rRNA gene sequencing (at least 500 ng per sample). The DNA quality and concentration were measured by agarose gel electrophoresis and NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with standards of ≥500 ng, 260/280 ratio of 1.7–1.8, and 260/230 ratio of 1.8–2.2 before downstream processing. The extracted DNA was used as the template to amplify the variable regions 3 and 4 (V3–V4) of the 16S rRNA gene using barcode-indexed PCR primers (341F and 805R) [6]. Library construction and sequencing of amplicon DNA samples were conducted by Genomics BioScience (Taipei, Taiwan). A pair-end sequencing library (insert size of 465 bp for each sample) was constructed with the sheared fragments using the TruSeq Nano DNA Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The purified amplicons with different index sequences were pooled in equimolar amounts and then sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq sequencer with the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). To reduce batch effects, all samples were sequenced simultaneously in the same laboratory (Germark Biotechnology, Taichung, Taiwan,).

After filtering, the sequences with 97% similarity of operational taxonomic units (OTU) from SILVA (version 123) taxonomic database [10,11] were clustered using the UCLUST algorithm [12] with a 97% sequence identity threshold. Reads were dereplicated, and singletons were discarded. The final OTU table was rarefied into minimum sequencing depth in the dataset.

Differences in demographic characteristics between the two phosphate binder groups were determined using Student’s t-test or chi-squared test, as appropriate. The α-diversity (i.e., bacterial diversity within one sample) was determined by the Shannon index and Simpson index using the R “vegan” package. The β-diversity (i.e., diversity in bacterial composition between samples) was estimated by computing the Bray-Curtis distance and was visualized through a Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) to evaluate the differences and similarities of bacterial communities [13]. Sample-grouped heterogeneity of β-diversity analysis was examined using analysis of similarity (Permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices (PERMANOVA)) with 104 bootstrap replications. The microbial alteration ratio modified from the microbial dysbiosis index (MDI) [14] was defined as the log10 of the total abundance in organisms increased in calcium carbonate users divided by the total abundance of organisms decreased in ferric citrate users.

Differential abundance analysis was performed based on the relative abundance levels of the top genera, families, and orders distinctly distributed between the two phosphate binders. We further analyzed the bacterial community difference between phosphate binder groups by the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of effect size (LEfSe) analysis at the OTU level with more than 0.1% relative abundances and present in >30% of samples to determine the most discriminatory taxa among phosphate binder users. The LEfSe analysis employed the non-parametric factorial Kruskal-Wallis test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test and LDA to identify differentially abundant taxa between the two phosphate binder groups. Only taxa with an LDA score more significant than two or less than two at a p < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Furthermore, the heat tree method was used to compare the abundance of different taxonomic levels for each pair of factors in a metadata variable. A hierarchical structure of taxonomic classifications to quantitatively (median abundance) and statistically (non-parameter Wilcoxon rank-sum test) depict taxa differences among communities was performed using R “metacoder” package [17]. Statistical analyses were performed using R statistical software (version 3.5.1).

Predicted functional genes were aligned to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database and annotated by KEGG orthology (KO) using the R “Tax4Fun” package [18]. The KEGG metabolic modules were retrieved from the KEGG MODULE database, mapped with KOs, and calculated the differential abundance between two phosphate binders by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. KEGG modules were deemed present when ≥30% of the enzymes were recovered after manual removing overly “promiscuous” enzymes (that is, present in multiple modules) before the abundance calculation.

In total, 85 HD patients provided a stool sample. After excluding participants who used two types of phosphate binders (n = 31), HD patients taking ferric citrate (n = 8) and calcium carbonate phosphate binders (n= 46) were compared, as shown in Figure S1. The baseline characteristics of the enrolled HD patients are reported in Table 1. The mean age was 55.8 years in the ferric citrate group and 61.5 years in the calcium carbonate group, with a mean HD duration of 91.5 months in ferric citrate users and 84.11 months in calcium carbonate users. The two groups were similar in age, gender, cause of end-stage renal disease, HD arteriovenous shunt type, comorbidities, medications known to affect the gut microbiota, the dietary consumption patterns of vegetables or fruits, and Bristol stool scale. In addition, there was no significant difference in hemoglobin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase ion calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone level between groups, as shown in Table 1.

In total, 85 HD patients provided a stool sample. After excluding participants who used two types of phosphate binders (n = 31), HD patients taking ferric citrate (n = 8) and calcium carbonate phosphate binders (n = 46) were compared (Figure S1). The baseline characteristics of the enrolled HD patients are reported in Table 1. The mean age was 55.8 years in the ferric citrate group and 61.5 years in the calcium carbonate group, with a mean HD duration of 91.5 months in ferric citrate users and 84.11 months in calcium carbonate users. The two groups were similar in age, gender, cause of end-stage renal disease, HD arteriovenous shunt type, comorbidities, medications known to affect the gut microbiota, the dietary consumption patterns of vegetables or fruits, and Bristol stool scale. In addition, there was no significant difference in hemoglobin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase ion calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone level between groups, as shown in Table 1.

No differences in gene rarefaction were found between two phosphate binders (Figure S2). To evaluate alterations in the microbiota structure between treatments, microbial α diversity (i.e., within-sample diversity) and β diversity (i.e., diversity between samples) were measured, with a significant decrease in the α diversity using the Shannon index (p = 0.049) and Simpson index (p = 0.001) in the calcium carbonate group (Figure 1A). The microbial alteration ratio was higher in calcium carbonate users compared to ferric citrate users (p < 0.001), as shown in Figure 1A. β diversity (bacterial community) was calculated using Bray-Curtis distance metrics and visualized in PCoA plots, with the microbiota composition of ferric citrate users significantly different from that of calcium carbonate users (PERMANOVA, p = 0.049) (Figure 1B).

For visualization of the internal interactions and further measurement of the microbial community, SparCC was used to calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient with the corresponding p-value between every two taxa. Co-occurrence analysis was used to investigate the potential relationships between different taxa in ferric citrate and calcium carbonate users. Each node in the network indicates a bacterial genus (Figures S3 and S4, Tables S1 and S2). The complexity and composition of the networks were similar for both phosphate binder groups. The highest identifying hub species within each ecosystem showed that Bacteroidetes was a potential keystone phylum determining the network in both phosphate binder groups. The identified centers (hubs) of core microbes included the species belong to genera Bacteroides in ferric citrate users and the species belong to genera Prevotella 9 in calcium carbonate users (Tables S1 and S2).

To identify the significant differentiating taxa between study groups, we performed a discriminant analysis using LEfSe and cladogram, showing enrichment in Gammaproteobacteria taxa in ferric citrate users, including the genera Pantoea, Enterobacter, Neisseria, and Klebsiella (all from order Enterobacterales) and the genus Pseudomonas (family Pseudomonadaceae); the genera Bacteroides (phylum Bacteroidetes), Lachnoclostridium, Ruminococcaceae UCG-004 (phylum Firmicutes) (Figure 2A,B). Streptococcus and Lactobacillales, belonging to the phylum of Bacilli as well as lactate producing bacteria, were enriched in the fecal microbiota of HD patients treated with calcium carbonate (Figure 2A,B). After linear discriminant analysis, the differentially enriched relative abundance demonstrated increased genus Streptococcus, family Streptococcaceae, and order Lactobacillales in calcium carbonate users (Figure S5). Regarding ferric citrate users, increased relative taxa abundance of family Bacteroidaceae was observed (Figure S5).

Furthermore, the heat tree method showed that compared to the ferric citrate users, the most abundant taxa among calcium carbonate users was class Bacilli, order Lactobacillales, family Streptoccaceae, genus Streptococcus, and species Streptococcus salivarius (Figure 3), whereas genus Ruminococcaceae UCG-004, Flavonifractor, and Cronobacter were enriched in ferric citrate phosphate binder users (Figure 3). The top eight genera abundance difference demonstrated the specific microbial features at the genus level associated with phosphate binder exposure, with significantly increased genera Klebsiella, Flavonifractor, Pantoea, Cronobacter, Ruminococcaceae UCG-004, Ruminococcaceae UCG-011, and one Ruminococcaceae with the unclassified genus in ferric citrate users, whereas calcium carbonate users had a higher relative abundance of genus Streptococcus (Figure 4).

To characterize the distinct functions of the gut microbiota, we performed functional annotations of the metagenome to KEGG modules. The predicted KEGG modules that were significantly enriched in calcium carbonate users related to metabolism, including pantothenate biosynthesis, C1-unit interconversion, and formaldehyde assimilation (serine pathway) (Figure S6). In contrast, the predicted KEGG modules significantly enriched in ferric citrate users included cholesterol biosynthesis, clavaminate biosynthesis, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli pathogenicity signature, and vibrio cholera pathogenicity signature (Figure S6).

In our study, the stool microbial communities in HD patients receiving ferric citrate and calcium carbonate were structurally different, with reduced microbial species diversity and increased microbial dysbiosis index in calcium carbonate users. The distinctiveness of the microbiota was confirmed by β diversity analysis (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metrics), demonstrating the clustering of samples according to two different phosphate binders, with the microbial communities in both groups containing higher levels of Bacteroidetes and lower levels of Firmicutes, similar to the microbial communities identified in rats with CKD [5]. In terms of the stool microbiota composition, calcium carbonate users had more bacteria from order Bacilli to species Streptococcus salivarius; specifically, genus Streptococcus was enriched in calcium carbonate users, while the genus Ruminococcaceae UCG-004, Flavonifractor, and Cronobacter were enriched in ferric citrate users.

Furthermore, the dietary information obtained from the questionnaire is subjective to recall bias. Our diet questionnaire was also limited to record the citrate intake among participants. The precision of dietary intake can benefit from having more objective dietary records. Third, other phosphate binders (e.g., lanthanum carbonate, sevelamer hydrochloride/carbonate, or sucroferric oxyhydroxide) that potentially affect gut microbiota were not evaluated in this study [24,53,54]. Fourth, the study was performed on Asian HD patients whose diet may be different from other populations. Last, to avoid the mixed effect of different phosphate binders on gut microbiota, participants ≥ two phosphate binders exposure were excluded. Furthermore, participants with ferric citrate or calcium carbonate treatment for more than two months can represent a single phosphate binder user in our study. Nevertheless, we only have a limited sample size with only eight ferric citrate users, so the results should be interpreted cautiously.

This study demonstrated that the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota were different in ferric citrate and calcium carbonate phosphate binders, confirming that different phosphate binders have additional effects, which may be mediated by the selective modulation of the microbiota. Further investigations are warranted for the cause–effect role of ferric citrate phosphate binder treatment on gut microbiota and subsequent manipulation of different phosphate binders to improve abnormal gut microbiota, thereby present promising targets for future studies.
