The Potential Role of the Intestinal Micromilieu and Individual Microbes in the Immunobiology of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy

Cellular immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells (CARTs) represents a breakthrough in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. CARTs are genetically engineered hybrid receptors that combine antigen-specificity of monoclonal antibodies with T cell function to direct patient-derived T cells to kill malignant cells expressing the target (tumor) antigen. CARTs have been introduced into clinical medicine as CD19-targeted CARTs for refractory and relapsed B cell malignancies. Despite high initial response rates, current CART therapies are limited by a long-term loss of antitumor efficacy, the occurrence of toxicities, and the lack of biomarkers for predicting therapy and toxicity outcomes. In the past decade, the gut microbiome of mammals has been extensively studied and evidence is accumulating that human health, apart from our own genome, largely depends on microbes that are living in and on the human body. The microbiome encompasses more than 1000 bacterial species who collectively encode a metagenome that guides multifaceted, bidirectional host-microbiome interactions, primarily through the action of microbial metabolites. Increasing knowledge has been accumulated on the role of the gut microbiome in T cell-driven anticancer immunotherapy. It has been shown that antibiotics, dietary components and gut microbes reciprocally affect the efficacy and toxicity of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo HCT) as the prototype of T cell-based immunotherapy for hematologic malignancies, and that microbiome diversity metrics can predict clinical outcomes of allo HCTs. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the principles of CD19-CART immunotherapy and major aspects of the gut microbiome and its modulators that impact antitumor T cell transfer therapies. We will outline i) the extrinsic and intrinsic variables that can contribute to the complex interaction of the gut microbiome and host in CART immunotherapy, including ii) antibiotic administration affecting loss of colonization resistance, expansion of pathobionts and disturbed mucosal and immunological homeostasis, and ii) the role of specific gut commensals and their microbial virulence factors in host immunity and inflammation. Although the role of the gut microbiome in CART immunotherapy has only been marginally explored so far, this review may open a new chapter and views on putative connections and mechanisms.

Primary cancer treatment relied for decades almost exclusively on surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. With the development of monoclonal antibodies and the advent of stem cell transplantation, immunotherapy became a clinical option for the treatment of malignant diseases. Agents that induce or enhance antitumor responses, i.e. immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) and adoptive T cell (ATC) therapy have revolutionized immunotherapeutic approaches. ICI using monoclonal antibodies against the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1 L) (1) are now considered the standard of care in numerous solid and hematologic malignancies including advanced-stage melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, or renal cell carcinoma (2). ATC therapy including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene-transduced T cells (CARTs) redirects T cells to tumor antigens. Therapy with TILs has achieved promising therapeutic results in melanoma (3–6) and TCR T cell receptor therapy is under clinical evaluation for different malignancies (NCT03686124, NCT03970382, NCT03691376). TILs and TCR T cell therapy are restricted to Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-expressing antigens. In contrast, CARTs act in an HLA-independent manner and have the potential to effectively recognize target surface antigens, thus restricting immune evasion of malignant cells by HLA-downregulation.

Besides CD19 as target, CARTs are under development against other tumor antigens, e. g. CD22 for ALL (44–46), CD30 for Hodgkin lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (47, 48) or CD5 for T cell lymphoma (49). For multiple myeloma (MM), CARTs targeting the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) (50–53) and for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) CARTs targeting CD33 (54), CD123 (55, 56) or CLL-1 (57) are under evaluation. Non-hematologic malignancies addressed by CARTs include glioblastoma (58–60) or neuroblastoma (61–63). CARTs to treat non-malignant indications, i.e. autoimmune (64) or infectious diseases, e. g. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections (NCT0361719; NCT03240328) are also being clinically evaluated. Besides of T cells as sources for CART production, natural killer (NK) cells are broadening the application of CAR cells beyond the autologous T cell setting (65). Currently, 861 CAR trials are ongoing (clinicaltrials.gov; search for CAR cells; February 14th 2021).

Upon encounter and binding of the CAR with the target antigen, CARTs get activated. Activation results in cytotoxicity towards the targeted cell and in immune activation by recruitment of other T cells and bystander immune cells. Depletion of recipient lymphocytes before CART administration enhances engraftment, persistence, and efficacy of CARTs due to the reduction of resident lymphocytes and the reduction of regulatory T cells (66). Furthermore, lymphodepletion has been shown to stimulate stromal cells to produce the cytokines IL-7 and IL-15, both associated with enhanced expansion of CARTs (67–69).

High-grade and long-term cytopenias are frequently observed after CART therapy and prone patients to infectious complications (13, 22, 23, 25, 28, 84–86). Also, B cell aplasia with secondary hypogammaglobulinemia due to the effects of CD19-directed CARTs on normal B cells can be associated with an increased risk of infections (87, 88).

Besides cytopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia, further risk factors for infections in CART patients include the number of prior chemotherapeutic treatment regimens, impaired performance status at immunotherapy start, ALL as underlying disease, a reduced absolute neutrophil count at baseline, a high dose of administered CARTs and the use of corticosteroid treatment for management of CART toxicities (15, 73, 89). In fact, early and late infectious complications, primarily of bacterial and viral origin, after CART administration are common (32, 85, 90–92). Besides, invasive fungal infections (90, 93) and reactivation of latent DNA viruses are observed after CART treatment (79, 85, 94).

However, in neutropenic CART patients, antibiotic treatment is consensually strongly advised (97, 98), especially considering the high number of infections in these patients (92, 97). A recent study in children reported that infections occurs in about half of them within 3 months before the intervention and in about 40% of the patients in the first days after CART infusion. Bacteria accounted for half of the infections causing a high number of severe and life-threatening bacteremia, notably E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp (99). In adult patients, infections were more common within the first 2 months after CART cell therapy, and again bacteria were the most common causative pathogens. Intriguingly, the gut as site of infection and intestinal commensals were found to account for a considerable fraction of infections (89).

Antibiotics are commonly used in patients undergoing antitumor therapies to prevent and/or reduce infectious complications. Nonetheless, antibiotics have been shown to promote development of chronic diseases and to affect the clinical outcome of patients treated with immunotherapies (100), which is suggested to be (at least in part) due to negative effects on the gut commensal microbiome. Despite their essential role in managing infections and, thereby, saving lives, there is a growing body of evidence showing that antibiotics have detrimental impact on the antitumor efficacy of T cell-based immunotherapies, notably ICI therapies (see review of the clinical studies in Table 1 ). Such adverse influence on the ICI outcomes are hypothesized to occur through modulation of the intestinal microbiome. Therefore, we will focus in the following chapters on the intestinal microbiome, individual commensals and their potential role in anticancer T cell therapies.

The human body harbors a massive number of microbial members (likewise the number of human cells) that orchestrate a comprehensive range of physiological processes, diseases and cancer susceptibility. Their 100-fold higher gene diversity encodes outstanding mechanism and metabolic competences that influence their own microbial niche, host tissue specific and immune cells function (111). This microbial ecosystem, collectively termed microbiome, is composed of eukaryotes (fungi and protozoa), virus and prokaryotes (112). The majority of commensal bacteria inhabit the colonic gastrointestinal tract while the minority are colonizing other anatomical regions such as oral-respiratory and urogenital tracts, skin as well as tumors. Overall, under healthy conditions, the host and microbiome exist in a symbiotic equilibrium as a metaorganism by providing a nutrient-rich microenvironment in return for aid in digestion and metabolism, respectively (113–115). As such, the microbiome synthesizes vitamins and breaks down food into absorbable nutrients, e.g., carbohydrates, or host signaling molecules such as short-chain fatty acids (116). Differences in geographic location, ethnicity, and dietary habits cause the human microbiome to be highly variable between and within individuals (117). In the last twenty years, research on the microbiome turned to be a field of enormous interest in a broad scientific community, which was leveraged by the Human Microbiome Project 1 and 2. Numerous diseases including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diabetes mellitus, cardiometabolic disease, liver disease, neurodevelopmental illnesses, and cancer have been shown to be associated with and even partially driven by alterations of the intestinal microbiome or of microbe-host interactions, termed dysbiosis (115, 118, 119).

Overall, recent research has greatly enhanced the understandings of the intimate, but complicated crosstalk between the microbiome and the immune system. Nevertheless, many unknowns and challenges remain in disentangling microbiome-immunity interactions in health and disease, notably cancer immunotherapies, which we will cover in the next chapters.

Before widespread use of next-generation sequencing techniques, culture-based methods already provided evidence that chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) perturb the oral and fecal microbiota of laboratory animals with an expansion of gram-negative anaerobes (152). These findings were later expanded by 16S rRNA sequencing results revealing a decrease in Eubacterium and Ruminococcus spp. as beneficial, SCFA producing bacteria (153). The complex interaction of microbes and chemotherapy is also reflected by pre-clinical results showing that the efficacy and toxicity of the drugs (e.g., 5-FU or irinotecan) depend on the intestinal bacterial composition (154, 155).

Regarding the toxicity of CART therapies, the most notable toxicities are CRS and neurotoxicity. However, gastrointestinal adverse events were reported in up to 28% of patients in a retrospective analysis by Abu-Sbeih et al. (160). All of them developed diarrhea, but also colitis and bloody stools were observed in rare cases, which can confound any microbiome configuration in these patients. Regarding chemotherapy effects without T cell transfer, in patients receiving a myeloablative conditioning therapy for NHL, chemotherapy was associated with an expansion of Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae, and a loss of Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Bifidobacterium spp. without any additional administration of other drugs such as antibiotics (157). Induction chemotherapy in patients with AML was also observed to reduce the alpha-diversity (i.e., the diversity and species richness within a patient’s biospecimen) of the oral and fecal microbiome during the course of therapy. However, the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics was found to be the major factor responsible for the loss of diversity in this cohort (156). In patients with advanced colorectal cancer, for instance, adjuvant chemotherapies with irinotecan-, oxaliplatin- and 5-FU-based regimens have also been reported to alter the bacterial and fungal community structure of the gut with outgrowth of Veillonella, Candida, Malassizia spp. and loss of Clostridiales and Faecalibacterium spp. (159). As another anticancer therapy associated with intestinal toxicity, pelvic irradiation for prostate cancer therapy was found to reduce intestinal microbiome diversity, notably in patients developing radiation enteropathy. Radiotherapy also led to a decreased microbial SCFA production capacity and decreased levels of homeostatic rectal mucosa cytokines predisposing to intestinal toxicities and adverse events in these patients (158).

As described above, the intestinal microbiota plays a major role in shaping innate and adaptive immunity (161). Therefore, it is plausible that the efficacy of immunotherapies that rely on peripheral immune cells, such as adoptive cell therapy (ACT) and ICI therapies, may depend on intestinal microbiome configurations and their metabolic outputs as it has been reported repeatedly in recent years (102, 162–164). The role of the microbiome in ICI immunotherapy has already been discussed in extensive reviews (165, 166).

The development of relapse after allo HCT is determined by the ability of the engrafting immune system to remove residual leukemia cells through a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. GVL depends on alloreactive, antigen-specific T cells, NK cell alloreactivity and activated DCs (173). In a large patient-centered study, Schluter et al. (174) described associations of the human gut microbiome with the dynamics of the immune system focusing on peripheral immune cells after allo HCT. Abundances of intestinal Ruminococcus gnavus and Staphylococcus spp. were positively associated with blood lymphocyte counts and post-transplant reconstitution, whereas Faecalibacterium was associated with increases in monocyte rates. Although this study lacks details on the subtypes of lymphocytes and other immune cells, it is the first of its kind to demonstrate a clinical relevance of microbiome-immune interactions in humans which has so far only been reported in animal models.

So far, there is only little reporting on the role of the gut microbiome in CART therapy. However, there are several lines of evidence highlighting plausible connections as described above and coming from other preclinical experiments. Intriguingly, the efficacy of ACT against HPV-associated cancers in a mouse model was observed to depend on the microbiome configuration of the host at steady-state by comparing mice obtained from two different vendors (Jackson vs. Harlan laboratories) (175). The microbiome differences were attributed to a diverse range of Bacteroides, Prevotella and Rikenellaceae. Following treatment with vancomycin, ACT efficacy was enhanced in Jackson mice, but not in Harlan mice. The increased ACT efficacy was also phenocopied by fecal microbiota transfers, with the microbiome affecting both tumor infiltration and expansion of reactive T cells (175). Along these lines, Paulos et al. reported that translocation of microbiome-derived components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from a radiation-injured gastrointestinal tract activated the innate immune system of tumor-bearing mice and, thereby, enhanced the ACT efficacy through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling (176). Antibiotic treatment, in turn, reduced the activation of the innate immune system in irradiated mice, and impaired the effectiveness of ACT. The broad-spectrum antibiotic-induced reduction of ACT efficacy was also shown for adoptive CD4+ T cell transfers against implanted colorectal tumors in mice (177). In the only published data on antibiotic effects in mouse CARTs so far, it was reported that the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics did not mitigate the tumor killing and survival of mice carrying A20 B-cell lymphomas and treated with CD19-CARTs (177). However, the depletion of the gut microbiome significantly prolonged the persistence of CARTs and the duration of B-cell aplasia in these mice.

In the following chapters we will focus on mechanistic details of microbe - immune interactions that are of particular relevance for patients receiving CD19-CART immunotherapies, notably the effects of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatments and the role of Enterococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp. as facultative pathogenic commensals frequently observed in cohorts of blood cancer patients.

Antibiotic treatment is one of the major causes of perturbation of the human gut microbiome. Alterations in the microbial composition is dependent on dosage, duration of treatment, form of application, and class of antibiotics (182). Various studies investigated the short- and long-term effects on the gut microbiome during and after antibiotic treatment. The most common observation was a decrease of alpha-diversity of the microbiome. For example, a 6-day cefuroxime administration led to a 5% loss of alpha-diversity, whereas 6-days of ciprofloxacin administration resulted in a 40% loss of microbial diversity (183). The loss of diversity was reported to come at the expense of bacteria belonging to Actinobacteria and Firmicutes whereas, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was found increased (182, 184–186).

The development of antibiotic resistances is a major subject of research, even more after it was declared by the WHO as one of the top 10 global public health threats (95). Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are phylogenetically conserved genes and their existence was dated back before the age of antibiotics (206). Due to the excessive use of antibiotics all over the world, the amount of ARGs in commensal and environmental bacteria was presumably never higher as today. It is well documented that the increased ARG-copy number in bacteria correlates with the use of antibiotics (207, 208). As reviewed recently (207), antibiotic pressure drives horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs with a specific selection of more differentiated ARGs. This selection occurs on the single nucleotide level indicating the high efficiency in gene selection conferring survival advantage. A process that facilitates the development of antibiotic resistance is antibiotic treatment under sub-inhibitory concentrations. It has been shown that antibiotic administration under sub-inhibitory conditions augment gene transfer and gene recombination (208, 209). This effective antibiotic resistance development of potential pathogens is associated with the expansion of individual microbes during antibiotic administration with potentially fatal consequences for the host.

Several microbes are known for their pathologic colonization properties, causing disturbance in the microbial community and contributing to severe infections. Among them are bacteria belonging to the genus Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Salmonella and Streptococcus (186, 189, 199, 203–205, 210, 211). Various mechanisms of colonization advantages and virulence development were described in recent studies, but little is known about immune regulation during colonization or the infection with these pathobionts.

Taken together, the expansion of individual microbes can have various impact on the mucosal and systemic immunity. However, there are still several open questions regarding the interplay of individual microbes, their virulence and the host immune system, notably T cell-driven anticancer immunity.

Effector function of T cells defined by the magnitude of cytokine production depends on triggering of the TCR by antigen recognition, engagement of costimulatory molecules and availability of proinflammatory cytokines (221, 222). Increasing evidence indicates that microbial metabolites and cell wall components can regulate the T cell function via host receptors and other target molecules ( Figure 1 ).

Besides regulatory and co-stimulatory actions of microbial metabolites on T cell function and antitumor immunity, the concept of “holoimmunity”, i.e., T cell-receptor mediated tolerance against the host and the microbial community residing within the host (233), has emerged as an interesting new area of research in cancer immunity. In this context, cross-reactivity between antigens expressed in commensal bacteria and neoepitopes in melanomas has been demonstrated in a mouse model. In detail, colonization of mice with commensal Bifidobacterium breve shape the TCR repertoire to target a bacterial epitope SVY. These T cells cross-react with the model neoantigen SIY on melanomas leading to decreased tumor growth and extended survival in Bifidobacterium colonized mice (234). In a recent seminal study, this concept of microbe-associated neoantigens in antitumor immunity was developed even further by demonstrating that bacteria residing within melanoma cells can stimulate an HLA presentation of novel peptides that elicit immune response of tumor-infiltrating T cells (235). Although not extensively studied, a considerable number of bacterial reads has also been recently found in DLBCL tissue (236), but whether bacteria-derived HLA-bound neoantigens also stimulate antitumor T cells or even CARTs remains speculative.

The problematic role of antibiotics on immunotherapy outcomes has been discussed in previous chapters. If antibiotics, however, are administered to cancer patients because of medical needs such as infections, strategies to protect a healthy microbiome are currently discussed and evaluated. For instance, a colon-targeted antibiotic adsorbent drug has been shown to protect the gut microbiome from moxifloxacin-induced loss of diversity in healthy volunteers (237). This drug is currently investigated in a phase III study with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients to investigate beneficial effects on the occurrence of life-threatening complications and increased survival.

To the best of our knowledge, none of the above-mentioned strategies has been studied in CART animal models or within clinical trials. However, these studies would provide enough evidence to initiate trials focusing on dietary or prebiotics approaches to modulate the microbiome and, subsequently, clinical outcomes in CART immunotherapy.

Multiple clinical and preclinical studies add to the growing evidence that the intestinal microbiome acts in concert with the host in determining antitumor immunity and the outcomes of cancer immunotherapy. For this reason, it is becoming increasingly clear that environmental or external injuries to the microbiome such as administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics can attenuate the efficacy of antitumor immunotherapies that even affect long-term survival. This emerging concept has already led to adjust antibiotic prophylaxis in clinical practice for allo HCT by switching to anaerobe sparing antibiotics (247), or by applying FMT to increase the anticancer efficacy of ICI (239).

Due to the short time from their approval, there are only preliminary data suggesting again an important role of the gut microbiome in CD19 CART immunotherapies. In Figure 2 , we are summarizing plausible perturbations of the microbiome in CART treated patients and their potential impact on the course of the therapy and outcomes. Finally, several modalities are highlighted including dietary interventions through prebiotics, probiotic therapies, FMT and adjustments in antibiotic regimens or phage-based antimicrobial therapies that can help restoring an injured microbiome. Whether these strategies improve response and prognosis of blood cancer patients treated with CART immunotherapies is subject of current studies.
