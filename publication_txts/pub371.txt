Evaluating the impact of domestication and captivity on the horse gut microbiome



The mammal gut microbiome, which includes host microbes and their respective genes, is now recognized as an essential second genome that provides critical functions to the host. In humans, studies have revealed that lifestyle strongly influences the composition and diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiome. We hypothesized that these trends in humans may be paralleled in mammals subjected to anthropogenic forces such as domestication and captivity, in which diets and natural life histories are often greatly modified. We investigated fecal microbiomes of Przewalski’s horse (PH; Equus ferus przewalskii), the only horses alive today not successfully domesticated by humans, and herded, domestic horse (E. f. caballus) living in adjacent natural grasslands. We discovered PH fecal microbiomes hosted a distinct and more diverse community of bacteria compared to domestic horses, which is likely partly explained by different plant diets as revealed by trnL maker data. Within the PH population, four individuals were born in captivity in European zoos and hosted a strikingly low diversity of fecal microbiota compared to individuals born in natural reserves in France and Mongolia. These results suggest that anthropogenic forces can dramatically reshape equid gastrointestinal microbiomes, which has broader implications for the conservation management of endangered mammals.

The gut microbiota of mammals provides the host with important functions, such as training the immune system early in life, metabolism, and synthesis of vitamins. This essential relationship between mammals and their microbes is the result of millions of years of co-evolution1. Therefore, disruptions between mammals and their microbial partners likely have major consequences for host health. In humans, the transition from hunter-gathering to farming and later to urban lifestyles included major dietary shifts, increased exposure to indoor environments, and the introduction of antibiotics and possibility of cesarean birth. These transitions are associated with a distinct and less diverse gut microbiome2–6 that has been implicated in the rise of immunologic and metabolic diseases7–9. A disruption of tightly evolved host-microbe relationships may be evident in non-human mammals as well, particularly those exposed to major diet and life history changes. We hypothesize that anthropogenic forces on mammals such as domestication and captivity in zoos may have reshaped mammal gut microbiomes. Domestication of animals is associated with modifications of species movement, feeding, protection, environment, and breeding, particularly to control behavior10. Captivity of mammals in zoos results in similar lifestyle modifications as domestication, but on shorter timescales and often with more extreme changes such as highly restricted diets, small habitat sizes, reduced social interactions, and higher exposures to antibiotics. Similar to humans, it is possible that these modifications will result in a distinct and less diverse gut microbiota in domesticated and captive mammals compared to wild conspecifics.

To test these hypotheses, we characterized fecal microbiomes via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of 44 PH and 28 domestic horses. In horses, fecal microbiomes are highly similar to the microbiome of the dorsal colon, but include many of the microbial taxa present in the ventral colon and cecum21, in which the bulk of fiber fermentation takes place. Therefore, we conclude that horse feces are an excellent, non-invasive means to assess the microbial fermentation communities in the large intestine of the horse. Additionally, we investigated whether horse populations were eating similar plant diets by amplicon sequencing of the P6 loop of the chloroplast trnL intron22 from the same fecal DNA extracts.

As in comparative studies of fecal microbiomes from human populations6, age had the most striking effect on horse fecal microbiome composition and diversity (Fig. 1, Figure S2). In horses >1 year in age, fecal microbiomes of both horse populations were dominated by taxa in the groups Bacteroidales, Treponema, Bacteroidetes, Fibrobacter, and Lachnospiraceae (Figure S3). The PH population included five pre-weaned newborn foals, which had a less phylogenetically diverse (Fig. 1a), and compositionally distinct (Figure S3) fecal microbial community compared to PHs over the age of 1 year. Two of the five PH foals had fecal microbiomes with very high abundance of Bacteroides (Figure S3), which are typically in high abundance before weaning in mammals23. The correlation of fecal microbial diversity present within the PH population and age remained significant even with foals excluded (Fig. 1b).

We are only beginning to understand the consequences of disrupting relationships between mammals and their microbial partners that have evolved over tens of millions of years. Domestication, as already shown for captivity34, may result in disruptions of gut microbial communities, especially in cases with diet shifts and restricted exposure to outdoor environments. This is particularly important for conservation managers as they urgently try to slow the Earth’s sixth major extinction in the wild. Therefore, it is critical to document the variables influencing the structure and diversity of microbiomes in wildlife populations with an eventual goal of considering microbiome health when managing endangered populations. Our findings also highlight the importance of life history in shaping the horse gastrointestinal microbiome. Importantly, a legacy of captivity may persist in zoo-born individuals, which we discovered harbored a much lower gut diversity than reserve-born individuals, with potential long-term survival consequences that may impact the outcome of reintroduction programs. Additional research on other zoo-born, re-introduced mammals is warranted. Finally, although some domesticated livestock have extinct wild ancestors (e.g. cattle), many still exist and can be studied. We suggest this could be a fruitful endeavor with possible health implications for the agricultural industry.

The PH population in Seer, Mongolia is intensely observed daily by the rangers of the Association TAKH. As a result, each horse is identifiable and associated with detailed life history data, including pedigree, age, social structure, health, and years of daily behavioral observations in the field (Table S3). Relatedness coefficients (Table S4) were calculated based on the known pedigree of each individual PH as reported in the international PH studbook, and using the tabular method35.

All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Because fecal material was collected without interacting with horses directly, approval for experimental protocols on vertebrate animals was not required. A CITES permit for the export of fecal material was granted (Certificate No. 1000543).

Fecal samples were initially transported from Seer, Mongolia to Centre for GeoGenetics in Copenhagen, Denmark. Subsequently they were shipped to University of Colorado Boulder, where DNA was extracted using the PowerSoil-htp 96 Well Soil DNA Isolation Kit following Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) standard protocols (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/dna-extraction-protocol/). This DNA extraction method is standard for both the Human Microbiome Project (https://www.hmpdacc.org/hmp/doc/HMP_MOP_Version12_0_072910.pdf) and the EMP, and has been demonstrated as robust for recovering microbial DNA from fecal samples36.

Subsequently, we amplified the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene with the 515 f/806r primer set that included golay error-correcting barcodes on the forward primer per EMP protocols (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/16 s/). Amplicons were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 on rapid run mode at the University of California San Diego Institute for Genomic Medicine Genomics Center. Forward sequence reads (~125 nucleotides) were demultiplexed using QIIME version 1.937. The forward read sequences (125 bp) were clustered using a sub-operational-taxonomic-unit (sOTU) approach, which uses error profiles to improve accuracy and specificity of sequences (i.e. correctly identify true single nucleotide polymorphisms versus Illumina platform sequencing errors that occur at a rate of 0.1% per nucleotide)38. sOTUs present in the data set less than 25 times (~0.0005) were filtered out, along with sequences identified as chloroplast and mitochondria. Samples were then rarified to 30,000 sequences per sample for downstream analyses.

We used the DNA extracts prepared for 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate fecal plant DNA content. We utilized a metabarcoding approach in which the P6 loop of the trnL (UAA) intron of chloroplast DNA (primers g and h; Taberlet et al.)22 was targeted by PCR, following the procedures described in Valentini et al. (2009) and performing PCR amplifications in four replicates. PCR amplifications were performed on 384 wells plates and contained 1x AmpliTaq Gold® 360 Mastermix (Life Technologies), 0.5 µM of each primer, 0.0032 mg bovine serum albumin (BSA, Roche Diagnostics) and 2 µL DNA extract, in 20 µL reaction volume. Thermocycling conditions had an initial denaturation step of 10 minutes at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 seconds at 95 °C, 30 seconds at 50 °C, and 60 seconds at 72 °C. Each reaction was tagged by a unique combination of primers39 containing each one index of 8 nucleotides (with at least 5 differences among them), allowing sequence-demultiplexing after sequencing. PCR products were purified using the MinElute PCR purification kit (QIAGEN GmbH), and finally mixed together using the same volume per reaction. Library preparation and sequencing were performed at Fasteris facilities (Geneva, Switzerland). Libraries were prepared using the MetaFast protocol (www.fasteris.com/metafast) and a pair-end sequencing (2 × 125 bp) was carried out using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using the HiSeq SBS Kit v4 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequence demultiplexing, trimming and filtering was performed using obitools22,39,40, removing trimmed sequences shorter than 10 bp and represented by less than 100 sequence reads over the whole data set. MOTU identification was done using the ecoTag algorithm40, the reference database was constituted from the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence database release 12641 using ecoPCR42.

We estimated alpha diversity for 16S rRNA and trnL data using the Shannon diversity index. We tested for significant effects of categorical metadata for alpha diversity using a Kruskal-Wallis test and report a Bonferroni corrected p-value. We tested Spearman correlations between numerical metadata/data categories and report a Rho and p-value using R software43. Beta diversity was assessed for 16S rRNA data using the unweighted UniFrac phylogenetic metric44,45 and for trnL data using the Bray Curtis metric. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was run on the resulting distance matrices and the resulting coordinates were visualized using Emperor 0.9.546. We tested for significant differences between categories for beta diversity using a PERMANOVA (Adonis) with a p-value based on 999 permutations (R, vegan package)43. We tested for correlations between distance matrices (e.g. 16S rRNA and trnL) using a mantel test and report a mantel r and a p-value based on 999 permutations. We compared PCoA plots using a Procrustes analysis, which transforms two principal coordinates (PCs) by rotating, scaling, and translating to minimize distance between matching samples. We report an M2 value, which is an estimate of distance between matched points, and a p-value calculated by shuffling identifiers in one PC 999 times and recalculating M2 values. These analyses were run using QIIME 1.937. We compared within and between horse population beta diversity distances using a two-sided Student’s two-sample t-test and report a Bonferroni-corrected p-values calculate using 999 permutations with QIIME 1.937.

The Analysis of Composition of Microbiomes (ANCOM) procedure compares the relative abundance of a taxon between two ecosystems by computing Aitchison’s49 log-ratio of abundance of each taxon relative to the abundance of all remaining taxa one at a time. Thus, if there are “m” taxa, then for each taxon it performs “m-1” tests and the significance of each test is determined using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure that controls for FDR at 0.05. To deal with the zero counts, we used an arbitrary pseudocount of 1. For a more detailed description of ANCOM we refer the reader to Mandal et al.50.

We investigated potential technical artefacts related to collecting samples in a remote field site that may influence microbiome diversity. These technical variables include method of sample preservation (PH and domestic), sample variation over days (PH), delay between defecation and sampling (PH), and delay between sampling and cooling (PH).

To generate a single representative sample for each individual PH, sOTUs were summed using the QIIME script collapse_samples.py. We focus analyses of the sample set preserved in RNAlater as noted above.
