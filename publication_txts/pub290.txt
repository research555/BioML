Biodiversity of protists and nematodes in the wild nonhuman primate gut

Documenting the natural diversity of eukaryotic organisms in the nonhuman primate (NHP) gut is important for understanding the evolution of the mammalian gut microbiome, its role in digestion, health and disease, and the consequences of anthropogenic change on primate biology and conservation. Despite the ecological significance of gut-associated eukaryotes, little is known about the factors that influence their assembly and diversity in mammals. In this study, we used an 18S rRNA gene fragment metabarcoding approach to assess the eukaryotic assemblage of 62 individuals representing 16 NHP species. We find that cercopithecoids, and especially the cercopithecines, have substantially higher alpha diversity than other NHP groups. Gut-associated protists and nematodes are widespread among NHPs, consistent with their ancient association with NHP hosts. However, we do not find a consistent signal of phylosymbiosis or host-species specificity. Rather, gut eukaryotes are only weakly structured by primate phylogeny with minimal signal from diet, in contrast to previous reports of NHP gut bacteria. The results of this study indicate that gut-associated eukaryotes offer different information than gut-associated bacteria and add to our understanding of the structure of the gut microbiome.

Comparative studies of gut microbiome structure across phylogenetically similar but ecologically distinct host species help clarify factors that regulate microbial community assembly, structure, and stability over time. In mammals, these patterns are shaped by a variety of factors including host gut physiology, diet, phylogeny [1–6], host age, geography [7, 8], and social behavior [9, 10]. Our current understanding of microbial community dynamics is shaped by a disproportionate focus on bacteria. This bias is due in part to the fact that eukaryotes are generally studied as parasites rather than community members [11], but they can also be beneficial or neutral depending on species and context [12]. The diversity and structure of the eukaryotic microbiome across hosts remains an open question [13, 14], even though eukaryotes are important members of the gastrointestinal microbial community [15, 16].

In this study, we analyzed 62 individual fecal samples from wild NHPs representing 16 species using an 18S rRNA gene fragment metabarcoding approach. NHPs were chosen to represent a wide geographic distribution including five platyrrhine species from Central and South America, six cercopithecoids and two ape species from Uganda, the Central African Republic, and Ethiopia, and three lemur species from Madagascar. We examine the effects of host phylogroup on the total eukaryotic assemblage structure, the relationship between bacterial and eukaryotic diversity, and the distribution of particular eukaryotic taxa across NHP lineages. Our results shed new light on the role of eukaryotes in microbial communities, as well as the utility of cross species comparative studies for understanding the evolution of the mammalian gut microbiome.

Raw fecal samples from 62 individual NHPs were collected and extracted as described in Amato et al. [2] and in Supplementary Methods. Metadata corresponding to samples can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

Extracted DNA was sent to the Integrated Microbiome Resource (IMR) laboratories at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada for library construction, quantitation, pooling, and sequencing following protocols in Comeau et al. [38]. Sequences were amplified with the 18S rRNA V4 targeted primers E572F (5′-CYGCGGTAATTCCAGCTC-3′) and E1009R (5′-CRAAGAYGATYAGATACCRT-3′). PCR reactions included a PNA mammal blocking primer (5′-TCTTAATCATGGCCTCAGTT-3′) to minimize host DNA amplification. Conditions for PCR are based on those described in Comeau et al. [39] but include an additional step at 65 °C to anneal the blocking primer. The final pool was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using paired-end 300-cycle chemistry.

An average of 30,244 reads were generated per sample (±25,015) (Supplementary Table 2). Primers were removed from raw sequences using Cutadapt v.1.18 [40]. We then merged and quality filtered trimmed paired-end reads with a phred score threshold of 30 using PEAR v.0.9.10 [41]. Merged and unmerged forward reads that passed quality thresholds were checked for chimeras using VSEARCH v.2.8.1 [42]. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were generated with Swarm v.2.2.2 [43] as implemented in QIIME v.1.9 [44] resulting in 203,222 unique OTUs. We then assigned taxonomy to each OTU using VSEARCH v.2.8.1 and the SILVA 18S rRNA gene database v.128 [45]. Any OTU that failed to match the SILVA database was checked against the full NCBI NT database with BLAST [46] and assigned taxonomy using MEGAN v.6 [47]. OTUs observed fewer than ten times across all samples, only once within a sample, or originated from clear dietary sources or the host (i.e., plants, vertebrates, and insects) were discarded. Detected taxa and predicted source (e.g., gut, environment, and diet) are found in Supplementary Table 3. The proportion of reads retained after filtering is highly variable between individuals (x̄ 40.31 ± 25.74%) (Fig. 1). The sole Lemur catta individual had no reads post filtering and was removed from downstream analysis. Samples were rarefied to 500 reads per sample prior to alpha and beta diversity analyses, but taxa summaries, distributions, and presence/absence were assessed from the unrarefied data.

We built reference phylogenetic trees based on published phylogenies for Entamoeba [59] and Blastocystis [60] which were then expanded each with the EukRef curation pipeline [61]. A nematode reference tree was generated from the SILVA v.128 99% clustered reference database. Sequences were aligned using Mafft v.7.407 [62] and maximum likelihood trees constructed with RAxML v.8.1.20 [63]. Phylogenetic placement of OTUs from this study was performed using RAxML with the reference tree as constraint. Some OTUs are collapsed into a single branch in the tree when clustered sequences had the same distribution across individual samples and one OTU had a higher read count (or when low abundance OTUs were found in a subset of samples), as these low abundance OTUs are often generated by sequencing artifacts. Finally, a statistical parsimony network [64] for Iodamoeba phylotypes was built using PopART [65] instead of a tree because Iodamoeba diversity is quite high and very few reference sequences are available for comparison [66]. The full OTU frequency table and metadata, as well as scripts used to process data and generate figures are at https://github.com/aemann01/primateEuk. Raw data and metadata are uploaded to the European Nucleotide Archive under accession number PRJEB32407.

Eukaryotic taxa detected across NHP species include organisms that reside in the gut along with many non-gut residents. Read counts were generally high after quality filtering (mean 20,377 reads, range 60–65,515), but in some samples large portions were dropped when removing clear dietary (plants, insects) or host reads (mean 9,822 reads, range 0–50,814; Fig. 1). After filtering, we find a eukaryotic gut assemblage composed of diverse gut residents as well as organisms that are likely dietary, transient, or postdepositional eukaryotes (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). While we aim to study only true NHP gut residents, identifying them is dependent on the taxonomic resolution of the data as well as a priori knowledge of which organisms colonize the NHP gut. Thus, we analyze diversity patterns for the whole eukaryotic gut assemblage to facilitate comparison with subsequent studies before focusing on clear gut residents.

As the eukaryotic gut signal cannot be reliably separated from dietary or environmental contamination at the community level, downstream analyses focused on known gut protist and helminth species. This study highlights the care necessary in interpreting eukaryotic gut microbiome data.

We find gut-associated nematode phylotypes that differ in distribution from host-specific to cosmopolitan (Fig. 4). For example, Physaloptera sp. (order Spirurida) is exclusively found in the brown woolly monkeys, L. lagotricha, while other Spirurida are found in both species of baboon (Pap. anubis and Pap. hamadryas) (Fig. 4a). Other nematode phylotypes have a more cosmopolitan distribution across many host species. For example, a group of similar phylotypes within the nematode order Rhabditida is present among multiple individuals in the species P. troglodytes, C. ascanius, Pap. anubis, Pap. hamadryas, T. gelada, and Pi. badius (Fig. 4a), which represent a diverse suite of diets, environments, and geographic distribution.

Entamoeba is the dominant eukaryotic gut resident detected in the current study. While Entamoeba is best known as a pathogen (Ent. histolytica is the causative agent of amoebic dysentery), many species of Entamoeba are commensal. We find multiple nonpathogenic lineages (Fig. 3a). Entamoeba are found in all NHP phylogroups with the highest frequency among cercopithecoids and especially Pap. anubis, Pap. hamadryas, Pi. badius, and C. ascanius (Fig. 3b). The colobine monkeys harbor phylotypes that fall within the Ent. bovis clade, but are distinct from RL3 previously detected in langurs [59]. This observation further supports an association between the Ent. bovis clade and folivorous primates, but expands known diversity. We also detected two novel Entamoeba phylotypes in Alouatta pigra, including one previously found in A. pigra [77]. Entamoeba phylotype diversity in the platyrrhine monkeys and apes is lower than in cercopithecines. We don’t find any phylotypes unique to lemurs and all phylotypes detected in lemurs are at low abundance (indicated by light colored dots in Fig.
3a). This may reflect an artifact of sequencing, such as barcode switching, rather than a true signal of shared phylotypes. Overall, the highest degree of phylotype sharing is between Papio and Cercopithecus (Fig. 3c). While phylotypes of Ent. coli and Ent. dispar are largely shared across multiple species, phylotypes of Ent. hartmanni and Ent. polecki have a higher degree of host specificity. This is especially apparent among phylotypes assigned to Ent. hartmanni and Ent. polecki: phylotypes detected in T. gelada (pink) are not found in any other NHP (Fig. 3a).

We detect a high diversity of Iodamoeba ribosomal lineage one (RL1) [66] phylotypes in Pap. anubis, Pap. hamadryas, and C. ascanius, many of which are shared (Fig. 5). We also found several very short reads assigned weakly to Iodamoeba from chimpanzees, but these were excluded from the network analysis because of low confidence. Iodamoeba is rarely studied and these results highlight unexpected diversity of Iodamoeba, and the need for further sampling across host species. We also find multiple phylotypes of Endolimax nana, another gut resident related to Entamoeba, in two C. ascanius individuals.

Targeted eukaryotic amplicon surveys yield a diverse suite of taxa that originate from dietary and environmental sources and are passing through the gut, as well as those that are true residents of the mammalian gut. Thus, eukaryotes detected in these surveys cannot be simply assumed to be gut residents as is commonly done for the mammalian gut bacterial community. The proportion of reads assigned to known gut-associated eukaryotes among NHPs in this study is highly variable within and across species groups with the highest proportion in the cercopithecines (45–99%) and the lowest among the lemurs (0–46%) (Fig. 1). Given the mixed nature of these data, isolating the true signal of the gut eukaryome is challenging. As such, community level analyses (e.g., beta diversity, comparisons of relative abundances across samples) are not fair representations of the data. Instead, we argue here that a focus on known gut taxa (e.g., Entamoeba, Iodamoeba, Blastocystis, and nematodes) that are common across NHPs can provide insights into the evolution of the gut eukaryome.

While not explicitly tested in the current study, the diversity of gut eukaryotes across NHP hosts appears to be driven by individual dynamics and host behavior and not phylosymbiosis or codiversification. For example, the Verreaux’s sifakas (P. verreauxi) in this study have very few reads assigned to gut-associated eukaryotes despite having high initial read counts (Fig. 1). Members of this species spend nearly all of their time in trees and their water is obtained from their food, limiting their contact with eukaryotic organisms that are transmitted through fecal contaminated soil or water [78, 79]. This observation is in extreme contrast to the baboons where obtained reads are dominated by eukaryotes known to reside in the gut. Baboons are large terrestrial monkeys and as such are in direct contact with potentially contaminated soil and water sources. Moreover, baboons have diverse and highly flexible omnivorous diets and are known to provision themselves on human crops and refuse [80], giving them ample opportunity to acquire diverse microorganisms. A previous study of the gut microbiome in baboons demonstrated that the local environment plays a substantial role in shaping the bacterial community [81], something that likely has an important role in the eukaryotic assemblage as well. In addition to those eukaryotic organisms that are natural residents of the NHP gut, organisms that likely originate from the environment provide insights into behavior or environmental context. For instance, gelada monkeys rely heavily on grass in their diets [82] but they may consume high numbers of insects under certain circumstances [83]. We find many reads assigned to Gregarinasina, a clade of apicomplexan insect symbionts which are not members of the vertebrate gut community, across all five gelada monkeys. This may indicate that these geladas supplement their diet with insects or that the grass they eat is contaminated with gregarine spores.

In NHPs, patterns of gut-eukaryotic load are modulated by host behavior including social structure, grooming, and parasite avoidance behaviors [5, 9, 84, 85], proximity to humans and other sources of transmission [86–88], and ecological factors (e.g., wet versus dry season) [89]. Assessing the relative contribution of these factors to variation in gut-eukaryotic load across NHPs in this study is beyond the scope of the current dataset but these are important considerations for future comparative research. As samples for each primate species in were collected at the same time, results from the current study provides a partial glimpse into the diversity of gut eukaryotes in wild NHPs.

Fungal OTUs detected in the current study are predominantly specific to individual NHPs with very few OTUs shared across hosts. This is in contrast to expectations of a resident suite of gut-associated fungi based on reports from human cohorts [90], though the status of human gut-associated fungi as true residents has been challenged [91, 92]. Instead, the majority of fungi detected here likely derive from food or environmental sources. For example, while Candida sp. are reported to be common members of the human gut [26], the highest number of reads assigned to this genus in the current dataset is to Candida fructus, a yeast commonly found on fruit [93]. Though the high diversity and interindividual inconsistency of fungi represented here likely reflect individual dynamics and feeding behavior, it does not preclude the possibility that some fungi may colonize the gut.

NHPs with high eukaryotic alpha diversity also tend to have higher bacterial alpha diversity, a pattern that suggests that mechanisms that promote high diversity in one also increase diversity in the other. For example, a diverse diet or larger social group may increase transmission or exposure to more diverse bacterial and eukaryotic organisms. Bacteria detected from fecal samples, like eukaryotes, are an assemblage of microbes originating from the environment, food and other ingested material, and true gut residents. Unlike eukaryotes, however, determining the origin of bacteria in the gut is difficult without strong prior expectations. NHPs with high bacterial diversity also tend to be those dominated by Amoebozoa. Thus, an alternative hypothesis is that the presence of gut-associated protists promotes higher bacterial diversity in the gut or the increased bacterial diversity is driven by intra- or extracellular symbionts carried by protist species. In the current study, these comparisons are confounded by host phylogeny as the cercopithecines have both the highest eukaryotic and bacterial diversity, and all individuals in these species are colonized by similar eukaryotes. Testing these hypotheses will require more extensive sampling within a host species to identify populations that differ independently in their eukaryotic and bacterial community composition.

NHPs colonized by Blastocystis sp., Nematoda, and Entamoeba sp. are enriched in bacterial taxa associated with gut permeability and inflammation (i.e., Oscillibacter) [94], but also those that may be protective against infection (e.g., Lachnospiraceae) [95], among others (Supplementary Table 4). Interestingly, the spirochete Treponema is enriched in NHPs with gut-associated nematodes or protists. Enrichment of this bacterial genus has previously been reported in Entamoeba sp.-positive humans [19]. Treponema is notably absent in industrialized human populations but common in extant traditional [36, 37, 96, 97] and extinct preindustrial human groups [35]. Our documentation of co-occurrence between gut eukaryotes and Treponema and other bacteria across primates suggests heretofore unappreciated interactions among classes of gut microbes that may provide mechanistic explanations for the loss of functionally linked taxa in industrialized populations.

Nematode phylotypes are typically host-specific or constrained to species within the same geographic region (Fig. 4c). For example, a single phylotype assigned to the Rhabditida nematode order is only found in red-bellied lemurs (E. rubriventer), while the whipworm genus Trichuris is detected in three arboreal cercopithecoids collected in Uganda (Pi. badius, Cer. ascanius, and Col. guereza). Similarly, a single phylotype within Oxyurida is found in a single brown woolly monkey (L. lagotricha) and is 99.24% identical to a Trypanoxyuris atelis (KU285460) specimen isolated from a black-handed spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi). This phylotype was also detected at very low abundance in two cercopithecoids (<10 reads) as compared with the brown woolly monkey (>40,000) and is commonly isolated in wild NHPs in Central and South America, making it likely that cercopithecoid sequences are artifacts (e.g., barcode switching) and the brown woolly monkey is the true host of this parasitic nematode. The wide distribution of other nematode phylotypes, however, is more robust. For example, a phylotype assigned to Rhabditida is found in 19 individuals in the cercopithecoid group with only five individuals with fewer than 50 reads assigned. This phylotype is 100% identical to the 18S rRNA gene of Oesophagostomum aculeatum (AB677956) isolated from a Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata yakui), demonstrating its wide range in African and Asian cercopithecoids.

Gut-associated protists including Blastocystis and Entamoeba are broadly distributed with the highest diversity in the cercopithecoids. This contrasts with greater host-specificity of nematodes. However, we see phylotype specificity within Blastocystis and Entamoeba, highlighting the great diversity encompassed within single genera for these ancient clades associated with the vertebrate gut. Interestingly, Entamoeba phylotype diversity in the platyrrhines, hominoids, and lemurs is largely a subset of the diversity found in the cercopithecoids, which may indicate that the association between NHPs and this protist group predates the divergence of major NHP phylogroups. Substantial overlap in Entamoeba phylotypes is especially prevalent in the cercopithecines, particularly Pap. anubis, Pap. hamadryas, C. ascanius, and Pi. badius. A high degree of phylotype sharing between these NHP species is likely driven by shared habitat (both baboon species were sampled from groups living in Ethiopia, while the red-tailed monkeys and western red colobus in this study live in the Kibale National Park in Uganda) but other phylotypes are shared across NHPs independent of geographic distance or habitat type. Despite substantial phylotype sharing among cercopithecines across Entamoeba at the genus level, Entamoeba species exhibit different levels of host-specificity. For example, while phylotypes of Ent. coli are shared across multiple host species, phylotypes of Ent. hartmanni may be more host-specific. This is especially clear among Ent. hartmanni phylotypes detected in the gelada monkeys (T. gelada), which are distinct from those found in other NHPs. Differential host specificity of Entamoeba phylotypes in the current study mirror results of previous studies of wild hominoids and humans in neighboring environments [87]. Unlike Entamoeba, which was found across all NHP phylogroups, Iodamoeba is primarily found in only three species of the cercopithecine group with a high degree of phylotype sharing that cannot be explained solely by a shared habitat. Instead, there appears to be a gradient of phylotype sharing across the baboons and red-tailed monkeys. The results of this study illustrate that the diversity of Iodamoeba is yet to be fully appreciated in wild NHPs. Finally, we detect Blastocystis across NHP hosts. We find ST1, ST2, and ST3 in baboons, with geladas and baboons sharing some phylotypes of ST1 and ST3. Cercopithecus ascanius harbor distinct ST3 phylotypes. Alouatta pigra harbors ST8 and we find ST11 in one chimpanzee (Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 5).

This study represents the largest to-date 18S rRNA amplicon survey of the gut microbiome in wild NHPs. Unlike the bacterial community [2], we find that the impact of host phylogeny on gut-associated eukaryotes is weak. We do not find evidence of phylosymbiosis and instead it is likely that individual dynamics, local ecology, and behavioral aspects shape the total eukaryotic assemblage, though the current dataset cannot verify the mechanisms that shape these patterns. Future studies should examine the impact of behavior and local ecology on the gut eukaryotic assemblage. Moreover, specific gut-associated eukaryotes document varying patterns of host specificity and geographic distribution. We suggest that further studies examining the major classes of microbes that constitute the complex community of taxa in the primate gut, including their interactions, will shed additional light on the structure, function, and evolution of the gastrointestinal microbiome.
