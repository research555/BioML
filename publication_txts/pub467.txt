Key features of the genetic architecture and evolution of host-microbe interactions revealed by high-resolution genetic mapping of the mucosa-associated gut microbiome in hybrid mice





Determining the forces that shape diversity in host-associated bacterial communities is critical to understanding the evolution and maintenance of metaorganisms. To gain deeper understanding of the role of host genetics in shaping gut microbial traits, we employed a powerful genetic mapping approach using inbred lines derived from the hybrid zone of two incipient house mouse species. Furthermore, we uniquely performed our analysis on microbial traits measured at the gut mucosal interface, which is in more direct contact with host cells and the immune system. Several mucosa-associated bacterial taxa have high heritability estimates, and interestingly, 16S rRNA transcript-based heritability estimates are positively correlated with cospeciation rate estimates. Genome-wide association mapping identifies 428 loci influencing 120 taxa, with narrow genomic intervals pinpointing promising candidate genes and pathways. Importantly, we identified an enrichment of candidate genes associated with several human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, and functional categories including innate immunity and G-protein-coupled receptors. These results highlight key features of the genetic architecture of mammalian host-microbe interactions and how they diverge as new species form.

The digestive system, particularly the large intestine, hosts many types of bacteria which together form the gut microbiome. The exact makeup of different bacterial species is specific to an individual, but microbiomes are often more similar between related individuals, and more generally, across related species. Whether this is because individuals share similar environments or similar genetic backgrounds remains unclear. These two factors can be disentangled by breeding different animal lineages – which have different genetic backgrounds while belonging to the same species – and then raising the progeny in the same environment.

Overall, the work by Doms et al. helps to pinpoint the genes that impact the microbiome; this knowledge could be helpful to examine how these interactions contribute to the emergence of conditions such as diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease, which are linked to perturbations in gut bacteria.

The recent widespread recognition of the gut microbiome’s importance to host health and fitness represents a critical advancement of biomedicine. Host phenotypes affected by the gut microbiome are documented in humans (Ley et al., 2006; Turnbaugh et al., 2009; Lynch and Pedersen, 2016), laboratory animals (Bäckhed et al., 2004; Turnbaugh et al., 2008; Rolig et al., 2015; Rosshart et al., 2017; Gould et al., 2018), and wild populations (Suzuki, 2017; Roth et al., 2019; Suzuki et al., 2020a; Hua et al., 2020), and include critical traits such as aiding digestion and energy uptake (Rowland et al., 2018), and the development and regulation of the immune system (Davenport, 2020).

In this study, we employed a powerful genetic mapping approach using inbred lines directly derived from the M. m. musculus–M. m. domesticus hybrid zone, and further focus on the mucosa-associated microbiota due to its more direct interaction with host cells (Fukata and Arditi, 2013; Chu and Mazmanian, 2013), distinct functions compared to the luminal microbiota (Wang et al., 2010; Vaga et al., 2020), and greater dependence on host genetics (Spor et al., 2011; Linnenbrink et al., 2013). Previous mapping studies using hybrids raised in a laboratory environment showed that high mapping resolution is possible due to the hundreds of generations of natural admixture between parental genomes in the hybrid zone (Turner and Harr, 2014; Pallares et al., 2014; Škrabar et al., 2018). Accordingly, we here identify 428 loci contributing to variation in 120 taxa, whose narrow genomic intervals (median <2 Mb) enable many individual candidate genes and pathways to be pinpointed. We identify a high proportion of bacterial taxa with significant heritability estimates and find that bacterial phenotyping based on 16S rRNA transcript compared to gene copy-based profiling yields an even higher proportion. Furthermore, these heritability estimates also significantly positively correlate with cospeciation rate estimates, suggesting a more extensive host genetic architecture for cospeciating taxa. Finally, we identify numerous enriched functional pathways, whose role in host-microbe interactions may be particularly important as new species form.

To obtain microbial traits for genetic mapping in the G2 mapping population, we sequenced the 16S rRNA gene from caecal mucosa samples of 320 hybrid male mice based on DNA and RNA (cDNA), which reflect bacterial cell number and activity, respectively. After applying quality filtering and subsampling 10,000 reads per sample, we identified a total of 4684 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). For further analyses, we established a ‘core microbiome’ (defined in Materials and methods), such that analyses were limited to those taxa common and abundant enough to reveal potential genetic signal. The core microbiome is composed of four phyla, five classes, five orders, 11 families, 27 genera, and 90 ASVs for RNA, and four phyla, five classes, six orders, 12 families, 28 genera and 46 ASVs for DNA. A combined total of 98 unique ASVs belong to the core, of which 38 were shared between DNA and RNA (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The most abundant genus in our core microbiome is Helicobacter (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B), consistent with a previous study of the wild hybrid M. m. musculus/M. m. domesticus mucosa-associated microbiome (Wang et al., 2015).

Importantly, inspection of the taxonomic profiles of the mapping population confirms that key features of the native mouse microbiome were retained in our wild-derived lines, despite multiple generations of breeding in the laboratory. For example, the number, identity, and relative proportions of major bacterial orders are more similar to wild-caught mice than to rederived classical laboratory strains (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A – Order-level bar plot; Fig S4 from Rosshart et al., 2017). This is consistent with a previous study which showed that microbiomes of wild-derived strains maintained their distinctiveness over 10 generations of breeding in the laboratory (Moeller et al., 2018).

Next, we estimated the narrow-sense heritability (h2) of bacterial traits using lme4QTL (Ziyatdinov et al., 2018). Of the 153 total core taxa, we identified 21 taxa for DNA and 30 taxa for RNA with significant heritability estimates (PRLRT<0.05, Restricted Likelihood Ratio test), with estimates ranging between 39 and 83% (Figure 1A–B and Supplementary file 1). The top values for bacterial abundances are similar to heritability estimates for body weight (87%) and body length (67%). ASV97 (genus Oscillibacter) followed by the genus Paraprevotella, and ASV7 (genus Paraprevotella) showed the highest heritability among DNA-based traits (80.8, 78.6, and 77.4%, respectively; Figure 1A), while ASV97 (genus Oscillibacter), followed by ASV36 (genus Oscillibacter), and ASV135 (unclassified order Bacteroidales) had the highest heritability among RNA-based traits (83.0, 80.2, and 79.3%, respectively; Figure 1B). The heritability estimates for DNA- and RNA-based measurements of the same taxa are significantly correlated (Spearman’s rho = 0.53, p=3.1 × 10–12, Figure 1—figure supplement 3).

We compared these heritability estimates to estimates from previous studies in other mammals (Supplementary file 1), including mice (O’Connor et al., 2014; Org et al., 2015), humans (Davenport et al., 2015; Goodrich et al., 2016; Turpin et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2020; Ishida et al., 2020; Hughes et al., 2020; Kurilshikov et al., 2021), pigs (Chen et al., 2018), and primates (Grieneisen et al., 2021). DNA-based heritability estimates are positively correlated with DNA-based heritability estimates from male mice (Spearman’s rho = 0.60, p=0.049, n=11; Org et al., 2015; Figure 1—figure supplement 5A) and with DNA-based heritability estimates from one human study (Spearman’s rho = 0.38, p=0.049, n=28; Turpin et al., 2016; Figure 1—figure supplement 5B).

In an important meta-analysis of the gut microbiome across diverse mammalian taxa, Groussin et al., 2017 estimated cospeciation rates of individual bacterial taxa by measuring the congruence of host and bacteria phylogenetic trees relative to the number of host-swap events. We reasoned that taxa with higher cospeciation rates might also demonstrate higher heritability, as these more intimate evolutionary relationships would provide a greater opportunity for genetic aspects to evolve. Intriguingly, we observe a significant positive correlation for RNA-based traits (h2, p=0.037, Spearman’s rho = 0.47; CH, p=0.012, Spearman’s rho = 0.55; Figure 1D; Figure 1—figure supplement 4D), but not for DNA-based traits (h2, Spearman’s rho = −0.062, p=0.80; CH, Spearman’s rho = −0.091, p=0.70; Figure 1C; Figure 1—figure supplement 4C) for both narrow-sense heritability and chip heritability estimates. To evaluate whether these results may be confounded by taxon abundance, we further used a multiple linear regression model incorporating both taxon abundance and cospeciation rate. The overall regression model was not significant (R2=0.27, F(2,17)=3.202, p=0.067). Furthermore, the cospeciation rate significantly predicts the heritability estimate (p=0.022), while the median abundance does not (p=0.92). Thus, heritability estimates and cospeciation rates are associated independent of taxon abundance. These results support the notion that cospeciating taxa evolved a greater dependency on host genes, and further suggest that bacterial activity may better reflect the underlying biological interactions.

Next, we performed genome-wide association mapping of the relative abundances of core taxa, in addition to two alpha-diversity measures (Shannon and Chao1 indices), based on 32,625 SNPs. We used a linear mixed model including both additive and dominance terms in the model to enable the identification of underdominance and overdominance in this hybrid mapping population. We included mating pair and the genotype-based genomic relatedness matrix (GRM) as random effects to control for maternal effects and relatedness, respectively (see Materials and methods). While we found no genome-wide significant associations for alpha diversity at either the DNA or RNA level (p>1.53 × 10–6), a total of 1030 genome-wide significant associations were identified for individual taxa (p<1.53 × 10–6, Supplementary file 2), of which 428 achieved study-wide significance (p<1.29 × 10–8). Apart from the X chromosome, all autosomal chromosomes contained study-wide significant associations (Figure 2). Out of the 153 mapped taxa, 120 had at least one significant association (Table 1). For the remainder of our analyses, we focus on the results using the more stringent study-wide threshold, and combined significant SNPs within 10 Mb into significant regions (Supplementary file 3). The median size of significant regions is 1.91 Mb, which harbour a median of 14 protein-coding genes. On average, we observe five significant mouse genomic regions per bacterial taxon.

SNPs: single nucleotide polymorphisms.

The significant genomic regions and SNPs are displayed in Figure 2A and B, respectively. Individual SNPs were associated with up to 14 taxa, and significant intervals with up to 30 taxa. The SNPs with the lowest p-values were associated with the genus Dorea and two ASVs belonging to Dorea (ASV184 and ASV293; Figure 2—figure supplement 1). At the RNA level this involves two loci: mm10-chr4: 67.07 Mb, where the peak SNP is 13 kb downstream of the closest gene Tlr4 (UNC7414459, p=2.31 × 10–69, additive p=4.48 × 10–118, dominance p=1.37 × 10–111; Figure 2; Figure 2—figure supplement 1), and mm10-chr15: 94.4 Mb, where the peak SNP is found within the Adamts20 gene (UNC26145702, p=4.51 × 10–65, additive p=1.87 × 10–113, dominance p=1.56 × 10–105; Figure 2; Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Interestingly, the Irak4 gene, whose protein product is rapidly recruited after TLR4 activation, is also located 181 kb upstream of Adamts20. The five taxa displaying the most associations were ASV19 (Bacteroides), Dorea, ASV36 (Oscillibacter), ASV35 (Bacteroides), and ASV98 (unclassified Lachnospiraceae) (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).

A total of 398 significant SNPs were ancestry informative between M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus (i.e. represent fixed differences between subspecies). To gain further insight into the genetic architecture of microbial trait abundances, we estimated the degree of dominance at each significant locus using the d/a ratio (Falconer, 1996), where alleles with strictly recessive, additive, and dominant effects have d/a values of –1, 0, and 1, respectively. As half of the SNPs were not ancestry informative (Figure 3A), it was not possible to consistently have a associated with one parent/subspecies, hence we report d/|a| such that it can be interpreted with respect to bacterial abundance. For the vast majority of loci (83.79%), the allele associated with higher abundance is recessive or partially recessive (–1.25<d/|a|<–0.75; Figure 3B). On the basis of the arbitrary cutoffs, we used to classify dominance, only a small proportion of alleles are underdominant (0.23%; d/|a|<–1.25). However, for one-third of the significant SNPs, the heterozygotes display transgressive phenotypes, i.e., mean abundances that are either significantly lower (31% of SNPs) or higher (2% of SNPs) than those of both homozygous genotypes. Interestingly, the domesticus allele was associated with higher bacterial abundance in two-thirds of this subset (33.9 vs. 16.5% musculus allele; Figure 3A).

Next, we estimated phenotypic effect sizes by calculating the percent variance explained (PVE) by the peak SNP of each significant region. Peak SNPs explain between 3 and 64% of the variance in bacterial abundance, with a median effect size of 9.3% (Figure 3C). The combined PVE by the additive effects of all significant markers for each taxon ranged from 0.000018 to 41.6%, with an average of 12% (Figure 1A–B). As expected, the combined additive effects of significant loci are typically much lower than the h2, which is the upper bound as it represents the total additive genetic effect. Interestingly, there are several taxa for which the PVE by additive and dominance effects of all significant SNPs exceeds h2 (e.g. genus Odoribacter and ASV234 [unclassified Ruminococcaceae] for RNA-based traits), indicating there are strong dominance effects. For example, Odoribacter has two significant regions which show overdominance, and ASV234 has seven significant regions which show underdominance.

Our mapping procedure involves testing for associations between a given microbial trait and a single SNP marker. However, the true genetic architecture is likely more complex. For example, multiple interacting genes in a common host regulatory pathway could influence a given taxonomic group and/or function, the latter of which could also be distributed among unrelated taxa (i.e. functional redundancy). Thus, in order to reveal potential higher-level biological phenomena among the identified loci, we performed pathway analysis to identify interactions and functional categories enriched among the genes in significant intervals. We used STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2019) to calculate a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of 925 protein-coding genes nearest to significant SNPs (upstream and/or downstream). A total of 768 genes were represented in the STRING database, and the maximal network is highly significant (STRING PPI enrichment p-value: 2.15×10–14) displaying 668 nodes connected by 1797 edges and an average node degree of 4.68. After retaining only the edges with the highest confidence (interaction score >0.9), this results in one large network with 233 nodes, 692 edges and ten smaller networks (Figure 4).

Finally, due to the observation of a significant enrichment of cospeciating taxa among the bacterial species depleted in early onset IBD (Groussin et al., 2017) and the evidence that IBD is especially associated with a dysbiosis in mucosa-associated communities (Yang et al., 2020a; Daniel et al., 2021), we specifically examined possible overrepresentation of genes involved in IBD (Khan et al., 2021) among the 925 genes neighbouring significant SNPs. We found 14 out of the 289 IBD genes, which was significantly more than expected by chance (10,000 times permuted mean: 2.7, simulated p=00001, Fisher’s exact test; Supplementary file 6). Interestingly, SNPs in 5 out of the 14 genes are associated with ASVs belonging to the genus Oscillibacter, a cospeciating taxon known to decrease during the active state of IBD (Metwaly et al., 2020).

Host loci that appear in multiple independent studies are more likely to represent true positive associations and/or less dependent on environmental perturbations. We therefore compiled a list of 648 unique confidence intervals of significant associations with gut bacterial taxa from seven previous mouse QTL studies (Benson et al., 2010; McKnite et al., 2012; Leamy et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Org et al., 2015; Snijders et al., 2016; Kemis et al., 2019) and compared this list to our significance intervals for bacterial taxa at both the DNA and RNA level (341 intervals). Regions larger than 10 Mb were removed from all studies. We found 441 overlapping intervals, which is significantly more than expected by chance (10,000 times permuted mean: 372.8, simulated p=0.005, Fisher’s exact test, see Materials and methods). Several of our smaller significant loci overlapped with larger loci from previous studies and removing this redundancy left 190 significant loci with a median interval size of 0.83 Mb (Figure 5). The most frequently identified locus is located on chromosome 2 169–171 Mb where protein coding genes Gm11011, Znf217, Tshz2, Bcas1, Cyp24a1, Pfdn4, 4930470P17Rik, and Dok5 are situated.

Additionally, we collected genes within genome-wide significant regions reported in seven human microbiome GWAS (mGWAS) (Bonder et al., 2016; Turpin et al., 2016; Goodrich et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Hughes et al., 2020; Rühlemann et al., 2021; Kurilshikov et al., 2021). However, no significant overrepresentation of genes was found within our significance intervals (p=0.16, Fisher’s exact test), nor within our list of genes closest to a significant SNP (p=0.62, Fisher’s exact test).

To further validate our results, we compared the list of genes contained within intervals of our study to a list of differentially expressed proteins between germ-free and conventionally raised mice (Mills et al., 2020). This comparison was made based on the general expectation that if a host gene influences microbial abundance, its own expression would be more likely to change according to differences in the microbiome. Thus, we examined the intersection between genes identified in our study and the proteins identified as highly associated (|π|>1) with the colonisation state of the colon and the small intestine (Mills et al., 2020). Out of the 373 overexpressed or underexpressed proteins according to colonisation status, we find 194 of their coding genes to be among our significant loci, of which 17 are the closest genes to a significant marker (Iyd, Nln, Slc26a3, Slc3a1, Myom2, Nebl, Tent5a, Fxr1, Cbr3, Chrodc1, Nucb2, Arhgef10l, Sucla2, Enpep, Prkcq, Aacs, and Cox7c). This is significantly more than expected by chance (simulated p=0.016, 10,000 permutations, Fisher’s exact test). Furthermore, analysing the PPI with STRING results in a significant network (STRING PPI enrichment <i>P-value = 1.73 × 10–14, and average node degree 2.4, Figure 5—figure supplement 1), with Cyp2c65, Cyp2c55, Cyp2b10, Gpx2, Cth, Eif3k, Eif1, Sucla2, and Rpl17 identified as hub genes (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).

Subsequently, we merged the information from Mills et al., 2020 and the seven previous QTL mapping studies discussed above to further narrow down the most promising candidate genes, and found 30 genes overlapping with our study. Of these 30 genes, six are the closest gene to a significant SNP. These genes are myomesine 2 (Myom2), solute carrier family 3 member 1 (Slc3a1), solute carrier family 26 member 3 (Slc26a3), nebulette (Nebl), carbonyl reductase 3 (Cbr3), and acetoacetyl-coA synthetase (Aacs).

To compile a comprehensive set of promising candidate genes, we combined results from network analysis, overlap with previous mouse QTL studies, and differential expression in GF vs conventional mice (see Materials and methods 'Curation of candidate genes’ and ). Next, we used STRING to construct a PPI network with this curated gene set, which is highly significant (STRING PPI enrichment <i>P-value < 1.0 × 10–16, average node degree = 4.85). We identified genes with the highest connectivity and most supporting information (original network see Figure 6—figure supplement 1), resulting in a final set of 79 candidate genes (Figure 6 and Supplementary file 7). The G-protein, GNG12 and the complement component 3 C3, are the proteins with the most edges in the network (30 and 25, respectively), followed by MCHR1, CXCL12, and NMUR2 with each 18 edges. Of these 79 highly connected genes, 35 are associated with bacteria that are either cospeciating (cospeciation rate >0.5; Groussin et al., 2017) and/or have high heritability (>0.5) suggesting a functionally important role for these bacterial taxa.

Understanding the forces that shape variation in host-associated bacterial communities within host species is key to understanding the evolution and maintenance of meta-organisms. Although numerous studies in mice and humans demonstrate that host genetics influences gut microbiota composition (McKnite et al., 2012; Leamy et al., 2014; Goodrich et al., 2014; Org et al., 2015; Davenport et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Bonder et al., 2016; Goodrich et al., 2016; Kemis et al., 2019; Suzuki et al., 2019; Ishida et al., 2020; Hughes et al., 2020; Rühlemann et al., 2021), our study is unique in a number of important ways. First, the unique genetic resource of mice collected from a naturally occurring hybrid zone together with their native microbes yielded extremely high mapping resolution and the possibility to uncover ongoing evolutionary processes in nature. Second, our study is the first to perform genetic mapping of 16S rRNA transcripts in the gut environment, which was previously shown to be superior to DNA-based profiling in a genetic mapping study of the skin microbiota (Belheouane et al., 2017). Third, our study is one of the only to specifically examine the mucosa-associated community. It was previously reasoned that the mucosal environment may better reflect host genetic variation (Spor et al., 2011), and evidence for this hypothesis exists in nature (Linnenbrink et al., 2013). Finally, by cross-referencing our results with previous mapping studies and recently available proteomic data from germ-free versus conventional mice, we curated a more reliable list of candidate genes and pathways. Taken together, these results provide unique and unprecedented insight into the genetic basis for host-microbe interactions (Supplementary file 1).

In summary, our study provides a number of novel insights into the importance of host genetic variation in shaping the gut microbiome, in particular for cospeciating bacterial taxa. These findings provide an exciting foundation for future studies of the precise mechanisms underlying host-gut microbiota interactions in the mammalian gut and should encourage future genetic mapping studies that extend analyses to the functional metagenomic sequence level.

We generated a mapping population using partially inbred strains derived from mice captured in the M. musculus–M. m. domesticus hybrid zone around Freising, Germany, in 2008 (Turner et al., 2012). Originally, four breeding stocks were derived from 8 to 9 ancestors captured from one (FS, HA, TU) or two sampling sites (HO), and maintained with four breeding pairs per generation using the HAN-rotation out-breeding scheme (Rapp, 1972). Eight inbred lines (two per breeding stock) were generated by brother/sister mating of the 8th generation lab-bred mice. We set up the cross when lines were at the 5th–9th generation of brother-sister meeting, with inbreeding coefficients of >82%.

This study was performed according to approved animal protocols and in­stitutional guidelines of the Max Planck Institute. Mice were maintained and handled in accordance with FELASA guidelines and German animal welfare law (Tierschutzgesetz § 11, permit from Veterinäramt Kreis Plön: 1401–144/PLÖ–004697).

Mice were kept in the same room and caged together with littermates after weaning before being separated into single cages 1 week prior to dissection (to minimize effects of social dominance on fertility traits for a related study). Mice were sacrificed at 91±5 days by CO2 asphyxiation. We recorded body weight, body length and tail length, and collected ear tissue for genotyping. The caecum was removed and gently separated from its contents through bisection and immersion in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany). After overnight storage in RNAlater at 4°C, the RNAlater was removed and tissue stored at –20°C.

We simultaneously extracted DNA and RNA from caecum tissue samples using Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) Allprep DNA/RNA 96-well kits. All samples were extracted together in the same extraction round and hence timepoint. We followed the manufacturer’s protocol, with the addition of an initial bead beating step using Lysing matrix E tubes (MP Biomedical, Eschwege) to increase cell lysis. We used caecum tissue because host genetics has a greater influence on the microbiota at this mucosal site than on the lumen contents (Linnenbrink et al., 2013). We performed reverse transcription of RNA with high-capacity cDNA transcription kits from Applied Biosystems (Darmstadt, Germany). We amplified the V1–V2 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene using barcoded primers (27F-338R) with fused MiSeq adapters and heterogeneity spacers following the description in Rausch et al., 2016 and sequenced amplicons with 250bp paired-reads on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Individual sequencing libraries were prepared in parallel for all DNA and RNA samples, respectively, resulting in one MiSeq library each. Accordingly, all individual 16S rRNA gene profiles within a given DNA- or RNA-based mapping analysis were generated by a single sequencing run. Thus, only direct comparisons between DNA- and RNA-based traits could be possibly confounded by sequencing run, and all analyses were performed independently for these two categories.

We assigned sequences to samples by exact matches of MID (multiplex identifier, 10 nt) sequences processed 16S rRNA sequences using the DADA2 pipeline, implemented in the DADA2 R package, version 1.16.0 (Callahan et al., 2016). Processing of the raw reads with DADA2 was performed separately for the DNA- and RNA-based libraries. Briefly, raw sequences were trimmed and quality filtered with the maximum two ‘expected errors’ allowed in a read, paired sequences were merged, ASVs were inferred, and chimeras removed. The two libraries were merged and another round of chimera removal was performed. We classified taxonomy using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) training set 16 (Cole et al., 2014). Classifications with low confidence at the genus level (<0.8) were grouped in the arbitrary taxon ‘unclassified_group’. For all downstream analyses, we rarefied samples to 10,000 reads each. Due to the quality filtering, we have phenotyping data for 286 individuals on DNA level, and 320 G2 individuals on RNA level.

We used the phyloseq R package (version 1.32.0) to estimate alpha diversity using the Shannon index and Chao1 index, and beta diversity using Bray-Curtis distance (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013). We defined core microbiomes at the DNA- and RNA-level, including taxa present in >25% of the samples and with median abundance of non-zero values > 0.2% for ASV and genus; and >0.5% for family, order, class, and phylum.

We extracted genomic DNA from ear samples using DNAeasy Blood and Tissue 96 well kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. We sent DNA samples from 26 G0 mice and 320 G2 mice to GeneSeek (Neogen, Lincoln, NE) for genotyping using the Giga Mouse Universal Genotyping Array (GigaMUGA; Morgan et al., 2015), an Illumina Infinium II array containing 141,090 SNP probes. We quality-filtered genotype data using plink 1.9 (Chang et al., 2015); we removed individuals with call rates < 90% and SNPs that were: not bi-allelic, missing in > 10% individuals, with minor allele frequency < 5%, or Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium exact test <i>P-values < 1e-10. A total of 64,103 SNPs and all but one G2 individual were retained. Prior to mapping, we LD-filtered SNPs with r2 > 0.9 using a window of 5 SNPs and a step size of 1 SNP. We retain 32,625 SNPs for mapping.

For each G0 and G2 mouse, we estimated a hybrid index – defined as the percentage of M. m. musculus ancestry. We identified ancestry-informative SNP markers by comparing GigaMUGA data from ten individuals each from two wild-derived outbred stocks of M. m. musculus (Kazakhstan and Czech Republic) and two of M. m. domesticus (Germany and France) maintained at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology (L.M. Turner and B. Payseur, unpublished data). We classified SNPs as ancestry informative if they had a minimum of 10 calls per subspecies, the major allele differed between musculus and domesticus, and the allele frequency difference between subspecies was >0.3. A total of 48,361 quality-filtered SNPs from the G0/G2 genotype data were informative, including 8775 SNPs with fixed differences between subspecies samples.

We computed a centred and a standardised relatedness matrix using the 32,625 filtered SNPs with GEMMA (v 0.98.1; Zhou and Stephens, 2012). The centred relatedness matrix was calculated with the formula:

where X denotes the n×p matrix of genotypes,
x
i
as its ith column representing the genotypes of ith SNP,
x
¯
i
as the sample mean and
1
n
as a n×1 vector of 1’s, and
v
x
i
as the sample variance of ith SNP.

We calculated heritabilities for bacterial abundances using linear mixed models implemented in the lme4qtl R package (version 0.2.2; Ziyatdinov et al., 2018). We included mating pair nested within the subcross identifier (Figure 1—figure supplement 6) as random effects to control for maternal effects and population structure, respectively. The narrow-sense heritability (h2) is expressed as:

We determined significance of the heritability estimates using exact restricted likelihood ratio tests, following Supplementary Note 3 in Ziyatdinov et al., 2018, using the exactRLRT() function of the R package RLRsim (version 3.1–6; Scheipl et al., 2008). Correlation with cospeciation rates was calculated for taxa shared between studies using the Spearman’s correlation test.

Prior to mapping, we inverse logistic transformed bacterial abundances using the inv.logit function from the R package gtools (version 3.9.2; Grieneisen et al., 2021).

To estimate the genomic interval represented by each significant LD-filtered SNP, we report significant regions defined by the most distant flanking SNPs in the full pre-LD-filtered genotype dataset showing r2 >0.9 with each significant SNP. We combined significant regions less than 10 Mb apart into a single region. Genes situated in significant regions were retrieved using biomaRt (Durinck et al., 2009) and the mm10 mouse genome.

We estimated the percentage of variance explained by the lead SNP using a linear mixed model with the additive and dominance genotypes of the lead SNP included as a fixed effect and mating pair and kinship matrix as random effects in lme4QTL (Ziyatdinov et al., 2018). We used the r.squaredGLMM function from the MuMIn R package (v 1.37.17; Kamil, 2020) to calculate the marginal R_GLMM², which represents the variance explained by the fixed effects (i.e. the genotype effect). The total variance explained by all significant SNPs was calculated similarly with the exception of including all significant SNPs as fixed effects instead of only the lead SNP. This was performed using the additive genotypes only and both the additive and the dominance genotypes.

We classified dominance for SNPs with significant associations on the basis of the d/a ratio (Falconer, 1996) where d is the dominance effect, a the additive effect. As the expected value under purely additive effects is 0. As our mapping population is a multiparental-line cross, and not all SNPs were ancestry-informative with respect to musculus/domesticus, the sign of a effects is defined by the major allele within our mapping population, which lacks clear biological interpretation. To provide more meaningful values, we report d/|a|, such that a value of 1=complete dominance of the allele associated with higher bacterial abundance, and a value of –1=complete dominance of the allele associated with lower bacterial abundance. Values above 1 or below –1 indicate over/underdominance. We classified effects of significant regions the following arbitrary d/|a| ranges to classify dominance of significant regions (Burke et al., 2002; Miller et al., 2014): underdominant < −1.25, high abundance allele recessive between –1.25 and –0.75, partially recessive between –0.75 and –0.25, additive between –0.25 and 0.25, partially dominant between 0.25 and 0.75, dominant 0.75 and 1.25, and overdominant > 1.25.

The nearest genes upstream and downstream of the significant SNPs were identified using the locateVariants() function from the VariantAnnotation R package (version 1.34.0; Obenchain et al., 2014) using the default parameters. A maximum of two genes per locus were included (one upstream, and one downstream of a given SNP).

We identified over represented KEGG pathways and human diseases using the clusterprofiler R package (version 3.16.1; Yu et al., 2012). p-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Pathways and diseases with an adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered overrepresented.

To test for significant overlap with loci identified in previous mapping studies and for overrepresentation of IBD genes, we used the tool poverlap (Pedersen and Brown, 2013) to compare observed overlap to random expectations based on 10,000 permutations of significant regions. Regio`ping regions using the locateVariants() function from the VariantAnnotation R package (version 1.34.0; Obenchain et al., 2014).

From the total set of 11,618 genes situated within significant regions, we identified a set of high-confidence genes, which met one or more of the following criteria: (1) hub genes or nearest neighbours in the ‘closest gene network’ (Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1), (2) genes in regions overlapping with QTL from previous mouse studies (Figure 5), (3) genes differentially expressed between germ-free and conventional mice (Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 2; Mills et al., 2020). After filtering, the resulting set of 309 genes were given as input into STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2019) to construct a PPI network (304/309 genes were represented in the database; Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Finally, we selected one top candidate gene per significant region on the basis of network properties (degree and number of nodes) and/or fitting the most of the above-mentioned criteria. In case of a tie, the gene with the highest intestinal expression score (source: STRING) is chosen. Nodes without any edges were removed.

This paper uses inbred hybrid mouse lines to estimate the heritability of the mucosa-associated microbiome and map variants in the mouse genome that are associated with the composition of the microbiome. The findings are of broad interest to microbiome researchers and improve on knowledge in the field, as the mapping design facilitates the identification of narrow association intervals and points to a novel correlation between heritability and cospeciation rates. The manuscript provides useful information about the approach to heritability estimation, allowing the results to be more readily placed in context. Congratulations on this important contribution to the literature.

Decision letter after peer review:

Regarding code availability, I want to thank the authors for enhancing the README file on the github repository, which now provides a nice description of the pipeline and analysis steps. However, I am not sure if this is sufficient for readers who want to reproduce the results: looking at the code itself, it seems like there are commands to load scripts that are not included in the repository (e.g. the snp_heritability_lme4qtl.R script loads the script function_for_gemma.r that I couldn't find anywhere), and these scripts might not be able to be run on other machines. I recommend amending the github repository and scripts so that anyone who wishes to do so is able to run the analysis and reproduce the results.

We thank the reviewer for raising this important concern and agree that the heritability estimates appear high. We accordingly performed several analyses, which do confirm the robustness of the results. Details are given below in response to comment 3 and the major issue of Reviewer 3. In short, this resulted in the inclusion of a “sub-cross identifier” as an additional random effect (see Figure 1—figure supplement 4 for cross design). The current model includes the sub-cross identifier with the mating pair identifier nested within it (Author response image 1). We now clarify this in the text (see lines 834-836). The mating pair id accounts for both maternal effects and cage effects, as the mice were kept together with littermates after weaning and separated into single cages one week prior to dissection. All mice were kept in the same room.
