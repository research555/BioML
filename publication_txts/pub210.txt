The Oncobiome in Gastroenteric and Genitourinary Cancers

Early evidence suggests a strong association of microorganisms with several human cancers, and great efforts have been made to understand the pathophysiology underlying microbial carcinogenesis. Bacterial dysbiosis causes epithelial barrier failure, immune dysregulation and/or genotoxicity and, consequently, creates a tumor-permissive microenvironment. The majority of the bacteria in our body reside in the gastrointestinal tract, known as gut microbiota, which represents a complex and delicate ecosystem. Gut microbes can reach the pancreas, stomach and colon via the bloodstream. Oral bacterial translocations can also occur. In the stomach, pancreas and colon, low microbial diversity is associated with cancer, in particular with a bad prognosis. The urogenital tract also harbors unique microbiota, distinct from the gut microbiota, which might have a role in the urinary and female/male reproductive cancers’ pathogenesis. In healthy women, the majority of bacteria reside in the vagina and cervix and unlike other mucosal sites, the vaginal microbiota exhibits low microbial diversity. Genital dysbiosis might have an active role in the development and/or progression of gynecological malignancies through mechanisms including modulation of oestrogen metabolism. Urinary dysbiosis may influence the pathogenesis of bladder cancer and prostate cancer in males. Modulation of the microbiome via pre, pro and postbiotics, fecal or vaginal microbiota transplantation and engineering bacteria might prove useful in improving cancer treatment response and quality of life. Elucidating the complex host-microbiome interactions will result in prevention and therapeutic efficacy interventions.

The microbiome, often referred to as the “forgotten organ”, comprises all the genetic material within a microbiota that represents ten times that of our cells [1].

The aim of this review is to examine the intratumoral microbiome and document changes in the commensal microbiota of cancer patients, establishing a correlation with gastric, pancreatic and colorectal carcinogenesis, but also with gynecological cancers, as well as with carcinogenesis of the prostate and the bladder.

In the gastroenteric tract, the bacterial community varies between luminal and mucosal-associated communities.

An overview of the gastroenteric cancer-associated microbiome is shown in Figure 1.

The FRT microbiota interacts with the gut and with the urinary tract, defining a vagina–gut axis and a vagina–bladder axis, respectively [85,86]. FRT also influences other distal mucosal sites, for example, the oral cavity, directly or through mechanisms mediated by oestrogens. Enteric bacteria metabolize circulating oestrogens and the set of these microorganisms, and their genes is termed the oestrobolome [87]. Thus, a lack of oestrogen-metabolizing bacteria leading to a reduction in the gut microbiota diversity could influence the vaginal microbiome composition.

Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies of the female reproductive system, primarily because of its asymptomatic nature during the early stages of development. Significantly elevated levels of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes phylum bacteria, with Chlamydia trachomatis, Lactobacillus and Mycobacterium, have been reported in ovarian cancer. Chlamydia is known to contribute to cancer by inhibiting apoptosis, inducing DNA damage response and increasing susceptibility to other infections [126]. In addition to the known risk factors for ovarian cancer, such as genetic predisposition, early ovulation and late menopause, nullity, obesity and fertility medication/hormone therapy, an alteration of the microbiota is emerging [127,128]. Multiple reports indicate the association between a comparative decrease in intestinal microbiota diversity and ovarian cancer [129]. The bacteria which normally colonize the ovary are the following: Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Fusobacterium, Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas and Methylobacterium along with HPV. Early evidence suggests that Proteobacteria and Firmicutes phylum are significantly increased in ovarian cancer tumors [130]. Furthermore, the presence of Brucella, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia in more than 60% of the screened samples along with Chlamydia trachomatis, Lactobacillus and Mycobacterium species suggests an association of disrupted microbiota composition with the development of ovarian cancer [126,130,131,132,133,134]. The causational link between microbiota and ovarian cancer remains unclear. These microorganisms might induce carcinogenesis through direct or indirect mechanisms; however, the highly anoxic tumor microenvironment might also favor the recruitment and growth of anaerobic microorganisms, such as Chlamydia spp. [130]. The study by Banerjee et al. has identified a microbiome signature unique to ovarian cancers, showing that the microbiome of ovarian tumors is quite different from its surrounding non-cancerous tissue and very different from ovarian tissue very distant from the tumor.

Little is known about the microbiome of the MTR and there are only a few studies on the male urine microbiota (MUM). The healthy MUM is characterized by genera such as Lactobacillus, Sneathia, Veillonella, Corynebacterium Prevotella, Streptococcus and Ureaplasma, and these are also found on urethral swabs [135,136]. A study of men with and without sexually transmitted infections (STIs) found that bacteria associated with STIs but also with vaginal dysbiosis can be found in STI-positive patients [137].

The genital microbiota interacts with the urinary tract, probably by translocations of both uropathogens and health-associated bacteria [86]. Sequencing analyses of the microbiome highlighted its interconnection in that the same taxa are found in different but close organs, such as the bladder and vagina in women (bladder-vaginal axis) or the urethra and prostate in men [155,156]. The microbiome is also shared between sexual partners, such as the penile skin, urethra and semen of male partners and the vagina of female partners) [86,157,158]. The urogenital microbiota is a potential risk factor in the development and progression of genitourinary cancers (Figure 1).

Although the number of analyses is restricted, some authors found essential distinctions between the urinary microbiota of men and women [156,159]. This outcome is not surprising given the differences in the anatomical system, hormones and local defenses. Ultra-deep pyrosequencing showed that the most abundant bacterial taxa in the urine of healthy individuals are the following: Lactobacillus, Corynebacterium, Prevotella, Staphylococcus, Gardnerella and Streptococcus, with a preponderance of Prevotella, Lactobacillus and Gardnerella in women and Corynebacterium in men [156,160]. The urinary tract has its own microbiome because urine passing through the urethra is contiguous to the external environment and exposed to the skin and the openings of the gastrointestinal tract and vaginal mucosae, which host their microbiota. Like intestinal microbiota, urinary microbiota is age-dependent [159], with important distinctions among age groups. Data from studies of midstream urine (used as a proxy of the bladder microbiome) suggested that a more heterogeneous mix of bacterial genera exists in women’s samples (6–36 genera) than in men’s samples (from 1 to 8 genera, but also one sample with 51 genera) [159]. Moreover, regardless of sex, in the majority of samples, more than 50% of bacteria appertained ed to the phylum Firmicutes. Women’s samples also had members of the phyla Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, which were generally missing from the male samples. In addition, midstream urinary research proved the presence of a core microbiome, also in the bladder, but with variability in the abundance of the core bacteria, along with a variable preponderance of other bacteria, across age groups. This statement was more valid in the urinary tract than in the gut microbiome [161,162], sustaining the hypothesis that bladder colonization with specific genera throughout a lifetime might impact the disposition for bladder pathology in later life. These findings might also elucidate the distinction in the frequency of urinary diseases observed in men and women.

Acinetobacter and Anaerococcus were found in higher abundance in bladder cancer patients compared to the non-cancer group [173]. Virulence factors of Acinetobacter baumannii include invasion of epithelial cells, phospholipid degradation and biofilm construction, which encourages escape from the host immune response [174]. Member of the Gram-positive anaerobic cocci, the Anaerococcus was documented to induce inflammation and remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) [175]. The authors introduce the possibility that the interplay of ECM, microbiome, and inflammation plays a crucial role in bladder cancer onset, advancement, and relapse [176]. In 2002, Seow et al. [177] found that Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG inhibited the growth of bladder cancer cells by stimulating a cytotoxic effect. Accordingly, Ohashi et al. [178] performed a case-control matched study to analyze bladder cancer risk reduction associated with the consumption of products based on fermented milk. The probability ratio for recurrence was 0.46 (95% confidence interval: 0.27–0.79) for consuming fermented milk products 1–2 times per week versus less than 1–2 times per month. The outcomes indicated that the regular intake of lactic acid bacteria decreased the risk of bladder cancer. Indeed, epidemiological analyses have demonstrated that UBC incidence depends on age and that men have a more elevated risk than women, with a rate proportion of at least 3:1 [179,180]. The relationship between bladder-associated microbiota and cancer incidence in men and women has not yet been comprehensively assessed. For example, whether the dominant bacterial strain Lactobacillus in the bladder of women might protect against UBC is unknown, although many reports have shown that Lactobacillus might reduce chronic inflammation and potentiate several immune responses [181,182,183]. A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in patients with primary bladder tumors documented that daily oral administration of freeze-dried Lactobacillus casei sp. Shirota for 1 year controlled the recurrence of UBC after transurethral resection of the tumors [184]. Another multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial that included 207 patients demonstrated that patients treated orally for 1 year with Lactobacillus casei sp. Shirota together with transurethral epirubicin had a remarkably lower UBC recurrence rate at 3 years compared with the group treated with epirubicin only. However, overall survival did not differ between the groups [185]. In addition, a case-control study in 180 patients and 445 population-based controls revealed that regular (1–2 times per week) probiotic intake decreased UBC risk in the healthy population [178]. Taken together, these results strongly support the protective role of Lactobacillus casei sp. Shirota against bladder cancer. The bladder epithelium can work as a constant reservoir for viable but nonculturable uropathogenic bacterial strains, ultimately leading to bladder or kidney infection [156,186,187]. In these cases, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus saprophyticus strains are the most often isolated species. Still, many other bacteria can also be found [156,186,187,188], meaning that bladder commensal populations are polymicrobial and variable [160,182,183,189]. In bladder cancer, an initial study found a connection between urinary dysbiosis (specifically, an altered ratio among Pseudomonas and Anaerococcus versus Streptococcus) and urothelial carcinoma [171]. The urinary microbiota varies between men and women, and urinary dysbiosis might be associated with UBC. Indeed, the urinary microbiome might be different from the bacteria strictly related to the urothelium, and a clear association between mucosa-associated microbiota and the incidence and outcome of UBC is lacking.

Given the significant role that the microbiome appears to play in cancer, modulation of the microbiota could influence the course of the disease (Figure 1). Dysbiosis has so far been observed to play an important role in the onset of tumors. In particular, it was discussed how the presence or absence of some bacterial species can have a pro-cancerous or protective role. In response to these studies, it is easy to understand how a first therapeutic approach can be represented by pre, pro and postbiotics. Probiotics are live bacteria that can be administered orally [190] capable of improving the functionality of the intestinal barrier; prebiotics cannot be digested by the human body and are fermented by specific types of bacteria [191]; finally, postbiotics are bacterial products or metabolites that have beneficial activity within the human host [192]. A 2018 study showed how the alteration of the intestinal microbiome following an antibiotic treatment influences therapeutic responses, acting on antitumor immunity and the efficacy of immunotherapy [193]. The microbiota can act on the functionality of the therapy by modifying the pharmacokinetics of the drug used, thus altering its absorption, distribution, or metabolism [194]. Indeed, the structural and metabolic characteristics of bacteria recognize these potential targets to improve the efficacy of cancer therapy [195].

However, this therapeutic strategy is not without risk. A subtle balance needs to be struck between the number of introduced bacteria needed to achieve a therapeutic effect and the number at which the bacteria overwhelm the host’s immune system, particularly in the context of common host immunosuppression in cancer patients.

Accumulated evidence indicates that microbiota can enhance the carcinogenesis process through alterations in the metabolism, by controlling epithelial proliferation and differentiation and by influencing the immune response towards pathogenic organisms. Dysbiosis due to an imbalance in the interactions between the host epithelia and the microbiota can initiate chronic inflammation, epithelial barrier dysfunction and overgrowth of harmful bacteria. The polymicrobial synergy creates an ideal microenvironment for tumor degeneration and the tumor-associated microbiome. MAMPs, PAMPs and DAMPs, interacting with each other with pro-inflammatory action, they might contribute to carcinogenesis, creating a “microbiota-cancer axis” recently defined oncobiome. Barrier defects and the presence of genotoxins and pro-tumor metabolites produced by bacteria are fundamental in the process of carcinogenesis. The gut microbiota influences the pathogenesis of gastroenteric cancers but also modulates the onset of genitourinary cancers. Genitourinary carcinogenesis is also influenced by the dysbiosis of two other microbiomes, the urinary one and the vaginal one. Finally, some oral bacteria have also been shown to confer augmented susceptibility to these neoplasms. Different anticancer approaches, such as the use of pre, pro and postbiotics, fecal or vaginal microbiota transplantation and engineering bacteria, act by counteracting dysbiosis.
