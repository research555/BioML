Human mesenchymal stem cells treatment improved hepatic lesions and reversed gut microbiome disorder in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis

Effective therapies for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are urgently needed. We investigated the effect of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on the intestinal flora in NASH treatment. We isolated the hMSCs from the umbilical cords and divided male C57BL/6 mice into three groups, namely, chow, methionine–choline-deficient (MCD), and MCD+hMSCs. After collecting the feces and liver of the mice, we evaluated the histological changes in the liver and measured the inflammatory and fibrogenesis cytokines. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses. The hMSCs treatment could alleviate hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis induced by MCD diet. It could also reverse the microbiome and metabolome disorders in the NASH model. Correlation analysis of the interaction among bacteria amplified the effects of the bacteria in host. In conclusion, hMSCs treatment could improve NASH-related lesions and reverse gut microbiome and metabolome disorder in NASH.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of disorders ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) characterized by inflammation with the potential progression to fibrosis and cirrhosis over time [1]; NAFLD has become the most common chronic liver diseases in the world [2]. No specific medicine exists for this disease. For patients with early NAFLD, diet and exercise are the main treatment options. With progressing liver lipotoxicity, cellular stress, and inflammation, one third of NAFLD patients progressed to NASH and fibrosis in the next 4-5 years [3]. Moreover, NASH is rapidly becoming an indicator for liver transplantation (LT) and has become the second leading etiology for LT in the United States [4, 5]. However, LT as a therapy is limited by the shortage of organs and the high rate of complications [6]. Therefore, an economical and effective therapeutic approach to prevent the progression of NAFLD to NASH is urgently needed. Recent studies have indicated that gut microbiota might play a critical role in the onset of NAFLD and the progression to NASH [1].

The gut-liver axis plays an extremely important role in regulating liver microenvironment and intestinal microecology [7]. The current study aimed to explore the correlation between liver microenvironment and intestinal microecology and to further clarify the mechanism underlying the use of MSCs as therapy for NASH. Our study might provide a new treatment for NASH.

MSCs have specific surface molecular markers; they are positive for CD73, CD90, and CD105 and negative for CD34, CD45, CD11b, CD19, and HLA-DR [25, 26]. In our study, we first used flow cytometry to analyze and identify MSCs extracted from umbilical cord. As shown in Figure 1B, we first tested the positive molecular markers (CD90, CD105, and CD73) on the surface of MSCs, which were marked by FITC, PerCP-Cy™5.5, and APC, respectively. Subsequently, we tested the negative molecular markers (CD34, CD45, CD11b, CD19, and HLA-DR) on the surface of MSCs, which were marked by PE (Figure 1B). We used isotype antibodies as the control group (Figure 1A). When compared with the control group, the cells we used were verified as hMSCs.

C57BL/6 mice were fed with MCD diet for 12 weeks to induce NASH-related lesions, and hMSCs were administered intravenously via tail injection at week 10. As control, the resuspending liquid of hMSCs were administrated intravenously in C57BL/6 mice fed with chow and MCD at week 10.

As shown in Figure 2A, pathological sections of the mice liver were used for HE staining, and hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning were scored according to the NAFLD activity scoring system [27]. Compared with the chow group, MCD diet induced extensive macrovesicular fat accumulation along with infiltration of inflammatory cells, which were similar to the pathological changes of NASH in human patient. The administration of hMSCs significantly alleviated hepatic steatosis and inflammation induced by MCD diet compared with the MCD group. The mice liver sections were stained with Sirius red to evaluate the fibrosis of the liver, and the fibrosis stages were divided according to the NAFLD activity scoring system (Figure 2B). The MCD diet induced hepatic fibrosis compared with the chow diet, and the hMSCs treatment effectively alleviated liver fibrosis. To further clarify the alleviation of NASH-related lesions due to hMSCs therapy, we subsequently used PCR to analyze several inflammatory and fibrosis-related cytokines at the transcription level. As shown in Figure 2C, the inflammatory cytokines of TNF-a and CXCL-2 and the fibrogenesis cytokines of a-SMA and CTGF were all significantly downregulated in the MCD+hMSCs group compared with the MCD group.

To further explore the mechanism by which stem cells improve NASH, we investigated the impact of hMSCs on the gut microbiome through the metagenomic sequencing of the 16S rRNA.

First, we analyzed the principal components of intestinal flora among different groups, which was performed to calculate the beta-diversity values. As shown in Figure 3A, three groups, namely, the chow, MCD, and MCD+hMSCs groups, showed a clustering tendency in the first predictive principal component (X axis) and second predictive principal component (Y axis) in the unweighted UniFrac principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Next, we conducted alpha diversity analysis (Chao1) of mouse flora, which represented the stability of intestinal flora. As shown in Figure 3B, the number of intestinal flora in MCD diet group was significantly lower than that in the chow group, and hMSCs treatment increased the number of intestinal flora despite that no statistical difference was achieved. Subsequently, we analyzed the binary Jaccard clustering health map to further observe the integrity differences in the mice flora among the three groups. As depicted in Figure 3C, the hMSCs treatment effectively alleviated the flora disorder induced by MCD diet.

The hMSCs treatment alleviated intestinal flora disorder induced by MCD diet. Next, to further explore the distribution difference of intestinal flora among the three groups, we studied flora diversity at the level of family, phylum, and species.

To further identify the distinguishing phylotypes in the gut microbiota of the different groups, LEfSe analysis was performed. Compared with the chow group, lactobacillusaceae, Rikenellaceae, Alistipes, and Muribaculaceae decreased significantly, whereas Akkermansiaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Faecalibaculum and Bacteroides increased significantly in MCD group (as shown in Figure 4D). hMSCs treatment increased the numbers of Clostridia and alleviated MCD diet-induced changes in the microbiota flora (as shown in Figure 4E).

hMSCs could improve the intestinal flora disorder induced by MCD diet to some extent. To further elucidate the beneficial role of the altered microbial community, we studied the metabolic pathway and the interaction relationship of species among intestinal flora.

In addition, we found that intestinal flora can also play a role through the interaction among the flora. To clarify the correlation among species, we conducted Spearman rank correlation analysis according to the interaction of intestinal flora and built the correlation network with the data P < 0.05 and r > 0.5. As shown in Figure 5C, Desulfovibrionales had positive correlation with Odoribacter and negative correlation with Anaerotruncus. Muribaculum was negatively correlated with Turicibacter, Desulfovibrio, Faecalibaculum, and Akkermansiaceae.

Studies showed that MSCs could alleviate the inflammation and fibrosis of NASH [18], but the effect on intestinal flora during this period was unclear. Our results showed that beyond reducing inflammatory molecules and alleviating liver fibrosis, hMSCs could also reverse the disorder of NASH mice flora induced by the MCD diet.

Our study demonstrated that hMSCs could reverse the disorder of NASH mice flora induced by MCD diet, which might link the liver microenvironment with the intestinal microecology and provide a new mechanism for hMSCs to improve NASH-related lesions. However, our study had some limitations. First, although the pathological changes of our NASH model, which was characterized by hepatic steatosis and inflammatory infiltration, resembled those of human NASH, our model lacked the obesity and insulin resistance characteristics of NASH patients. So, further clinical studies are needed. Second, we found that hMSCs treatment could improve NASH-related lesions and intestinal flora disorder induced by MCD diet, but some of the changes attained were not statistically significant. In our future study, we will further optimize the experimental conditions and obtain more valuable experimental results.

Six to eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Branch of Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) and maintained under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with free access to food and water. The mice were acclimatized for 1 week with free access to a standard chow diet and water and randomly divided into two groups, as follows: (i) chow, controls fed with a regular diet, n=5 and (ii) MCD group, mice fed with MCD diet, n = 10. After 10 weeks, MCD mice were randomized into two groups again, as follows: (ii) MCD, untreated mice from the MCD group, n = 5; and (iii) MCD + hMSCs, mice fed with the MCD diet supplemented with an intravenous injection of 1×106 hMSCs administered at 10 weeks of the 12-week experiment, n = 5. At 12 weeks, all mice were euthanized, and liver tissues were harvested.

The study involving human material was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Perinatology. Umbilical cords were collected after normal deliveries, and each mother signed an informed consent.

Each cord was washed out with D-Hanks solution, the cord vein was catheterized and washed internally by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1% penicillin and streptomycin solution. We removed the blood vessels and cut umbilical cords into small pieces with scissors. Then, we incubated the pieces with 0.2% collagenase type I (ITS; Gibco, USA) for 2.5 h at 37 °C and 220 r/min. We plated the cells on a cell culture flask at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were cultured in a DMEM/F-12 medium (Gibco Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, USA) and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. We used the cells in our experiments after identifying the phenotype of hMSCs via flow cytometry.

For flow cytometry analysis, expanded cells were assessed using the BD Stemflow™ hMSCs Analysis Kit (BD Biosciences) for the presence of cell surface antigens CD73, CD90, and CD105 and the absence of CD34, CD45, CD11b, CD19, and HLA-DR, according to the methods in a previous report [54]. The cells were detached and washed twice with PBS and incubated with antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. Isotype controls were used for each antibody to detect the nonspecific background signal as negative controls. Stained cells were analyzed using BD FACSCanto II. We also used BD FACSDiva software for analysis and used the same setup for all tested populations. Data were analyzed using Flow Jo 7.6 software (BD Biosciences, USA).

For the liver tissue sections, 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) was used as a fixative. The sections were then embedded in paraffin. Subsequently, we cut the liver tissue into 2 μm-thick sections for staining with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Sirius Red. Then, we evaluated the hepatic steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, and liver fibrosis using microscope of OLYMPUS BX53 according to the NAFLD activity score (NAS) system [27]. Each image took 10 views, which basically contained all parts of the image. Finally, we used Graphpad Prism 8.0 software for analysis.

We used the total RNA (1 μg) extracted from the liver tissues by the TRIzol-glycogen method to generate cDNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions of PrimeScriptTMRT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Perfect Real Time). qPCR was performed using TB Green Premix Ex TaqTM (Tli RNaseH Plus) and routinely performed on StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System. The relative expression levels of mRNAs were normalized to that of β-actin mRNA. The relative quantification of gene expression was based on the comparative CT method, in which the number of targets was given by 2–ΔΔCt. The designed RT-qPCR primers were shown in Table 1.

When the mice were killed at 12 weeks, feces were harvested from the colon. Three or four feces were collected from each mouse. Subsequently, these feces were separately cryopreserved until further analyses.

Subsequently, we used the packages of R software to measure the a-diversity indexes (Chao1) and b-diversity (PCoA) among the three groups. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) Effect Size algorithm (LEfSe) were used to identify differences in the abundance of OTUs among the three groups with log 10 LDA scores >4.0. We used PICRUST software to predict metagenomic functional information based on the OTU table. We used STAMP software to determine the statistical differences of KEGG pathways among the three groups. Furthermore, a network diagram of bacterial interaction was constructed by Spearman rank correlation analysis.

Results were presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0 (California, UK). The Student's-test was used for the statistical analysis of all independent experiments. Comparisons of parameters for three groups were made by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's test. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

All procedures performed in studies involving animal experiments were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Animal Ethics Committee of Zhengzhou University and with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of Laboratory animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1978).
