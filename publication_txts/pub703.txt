Taxonomic profiling and populational patterns of bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) genes based on worldwide human gut microbiome



Bile salt hydrolase plays an important role in bile acid-mediated signaling pathways, which regulate lipid absorption, glucose metabolism, and energy homeostasis. Several reports suggest that changes in the composition of bile acids are found in many diseases caused by dysbacteriosis.

Here, we present the taxonomic identification of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) in human microbiota and elucidate the abundance and activity differences of various bacterial BSH among 11 different populations from six continents. For the first time, we revealed that bile salt hydrolase protein sequences (BSHs) are distributed in 591 intestinal bacterial strains within 117 genera in human microbiota, and 27.52% of these bacterial strains containing BSH paralogs. Significant variations are observed in BSH distribution patterns among different populations. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we reclassified these BSHs into eight phylotypes and investigated the abundance patterns of these phylotypes among different populations. From the inspection of enzyme activity among different BSH phylotypes, BSH-T3 showed the highest enzyme activity and is only found in Lactobaclillus. The phylotypes of BSH-T5 and BSH-T6 mainly from Bacteroides with high percentage of paralogs exhibit different enzyme activity and deconjugation activity. Furthermore, we found that there were significant differences between healthy individuals and patients with atherosclerosis and diabetes in some phylotypes of BSHs though the correlations were pleiotropic.

This study revealed the taxonomic and abundance profiling of BSH in human gut microbiome and provided a phylogenetic-based system to assess BSHs activity by classifying the target sequence into specific phylotype. Furthermore, the present work disclosed the variation patterns of BSHs among different populations of geographical regions and health/disease cohorts, which is essential to understand the role of BSH in the development and progression of related diseases.

Bile acids (BAs) are well known for regulating cholesterol balance, and disorders of BAs enterohepatic circulation can cause gallbladder [1] or gastrointestinal diseases [2]. The metabolism of BAs is also known to be associated with diabetes [3], obesity [4], and cardiovascular diseases [5]. BAs are synthesized from cholesterol in hepatocytes, after which they are further conjugated with the amino acids glycine or taurine to form bile salts and transfer to intestine (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Notably, the amphiphilic combination of bile salts is essential to the absorption of fat in the intestine. However, excessive bile salts are toxic to intestinal bacteria [6].

The HMP reference genome database demonstrates the taxonomic distribution of bacteria containing bile salt hydrolase protein sequences (BSHs), while the public gut metagenome databases can provide the abundance of BSHs in various populations of geographical regions and health/disease cohorts. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the taxonomic, populational, and functional patterns of BSH in human gut microbiota using computational and biological approaches with the following underlying aims: (1) to identify bacteria encoding BSHs in human gut microbiota; (2) to investigate the variation in sequence, structural, and biological activity variations of BSHs from different bacteria; (3) to explore the factors that might affect the patterns of BSHs in human microbiota; and (4) to discover the associations between the relative abundance of BSHs with several diseases.

At first, we obtained all available (total 765) BSHs from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database [24] (Additional file 1: Figure S2a), which were found to be distributed in 69 genera, mainly Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Paenibacillus, Lysinibacillus, Clostridium, and Brevibacillus, etc. (Additional file 1: Figure S3a). However, only 12 3D structures of BSH were reported in the protein data bank (PDB) database [25] (Additional file 1: Figure S2b). Then, we compared the amino acid sequences (Additional file 1: Figure S4) and structures (Fig. 1) of four BSHs that have reported their active site residues (Additional file 2: Table S1). The four BSH were from Clostridium [26], Bifidobacterium [27], Lactobacillus [28], and Enterococcus [29], respectively.

These results indicated that although there exist much sequence differences among different BSH, the functional residues, αββα fold of secondary structure, and core active site are conserved.

To explore differences among all BSHs from bacteria in human microbiota, a total number of 591 BSHs were identified from the HMP database [32] (Additional file 2: Table S2). All these BSHs were assigned to 117 genera from 12 phyla, namely Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, etc. (Additional file 2: Table S2, Fig. 2). Among these, more than half of BSHs (353 sequences, 59.73%) containing bacteria belonged to Firmicutes (Additional file 2: Table S2, Fig. 2a). Almost all strains in these genera, e.g., Staphylococcus, Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, Peptoclostridium, and Parabacteroides, contained BSHs (Fig.
2b). The results showed that a total of 26.03% of bacteria strains in the HMP microbiota reference genome encoding BSH (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, these 591 BSHs were distributed in only 447 strains because of the existence of paralogs (Additional file 2: Table S2, Additional file 1: Figure S6). Evaluation of the proportions of different numbers of paralogs (NP) revealed that 72.48% (324 strains) of strains encoding only one BSH, 23.49% (105 strains) had two, 3.36% (15 strains) had three BSHs, and three strains of Bacteroides had four BSHs (Fig. 2d, Additional file 2: Table S2). In total, there are 20 genera of bacteria in which 123 strains have paralogs (Addtional file 1: Figure S7 and Additional file 2: Table S2). Among them, Bacillus, Bacteroides, and Enterococcus have highest number of strains with paralogs (46, 27, and 13, respectively; Additional file 1: Figure S7).

The homology of BSHs between genera demonstrated that they were mainly distributed in two intervals, one at about 35% and the other at about 50% (Fig. 2e). However, there was also a lower identity of BSHs within the genus at about 50% (Fig. 2e). These results indicated that distinguishing BSHs by genera might not be a rational method because of the paralogs of BSHs harbored in the bacterial genome.

The BSHs obtained from the HMP database were further screened in the gut microbiome of worldwide populations (Additional file 2: Table S3). Among the 561 BSHs we obtained from the HMP database, only 156 were presented in the gut microbiome of 591 people from 11 different countries of six continents (Additional file 2: Table S4). The drastic decrease in the number of strains (591 to 156, 26.40%) indicates that many BSH-expressing bacteria are very low in abundance in the human gut microbiome and undetectable under the current sequencing depth.

Multivariable regression analysis was implemented to evaluate the relationship of BSHs abundance with gender, age, BMI, and population (Fig. 3). Gender, age, and BMI were not significantly correlated with the abundance of BSHs after adjustment (Fig. 3a, b, and c). However, significant associations were found between the cumulative RA of BSHs and populations from different geographical regions (pb = 1.2e-28, Fig. 3d). The populational factor explained the highest variations (35.15%) of BSHs abundance among the four factors (Fig. 3e). These results were consistent with the observation that disparity of the gut microbiota composition in different populations was mainly caused by geography [34].

Given the BSHs within genera showed a broad range of sequence dissimilarity because of the paralogs of BSHs in many strains (Fig. 2d, Additional file 1: Figure S7), the genus level patterns of BSHs abundance might not reflect the functional variations and phenotype associations clearly. Thus, we reclassified the 156 BSHs in the gut microbiome of populations observed in this study (11 countries, six continents) into eight phylotypes based on a phylogenetic tree (left panel of Fig. 4, Additional file 1: Figure S8). The results revealed seven major phylotypes, BSH-T1 (including 27 BSHs from 24 strains), BSH-T2 (including 19 BSHs from 17 strains), BSH-T3 (including six BSHs from five strains), BSH-T4 (including 14 BSHs from 14 strains), BSH-T5 (including 23 BSHs from 23 strains), BSH-T6 (including 46 BSHs from 39 strains), and BSH-T7 (including 14 BSHs from 14 strains). Moreover, BSH-T0 (including seven BSH from one to seven strains) could not be classified by hierarchical algorithms, but their sequences were relatively close to each other on the phylogenetic tree.

There were 28 strains with BSHs paralogs in 120 strains, the BSHs from Bacteroides, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, and Marvinbryantia showed varied phylotype distributions. Overall, nine strains with paralogs were distributed in the same phylotype (Additional file 1: Figure S8, marked by black triangles), 15 strains were distributed in two phylotypes (Additional file 1: Figure S8, marked by red triangles). Specifically, most of the strain with paralogs were from Bacteroides, and mainly distributed in two phylotypes, i.e., BSH-T5 and BSH-T6 (right panel of Fig. 4, Additional file 1: Figure S8). Four strains were distributed both within and between phylotypes (Additional file 1: Figure S8). Thus, different paralogs of BSHs within a genus could have sequence dissimilarity, which might lead to variable functional roles of these two genera in bile acid metabolism.

To compare the hydrolysis capacity among the eight phylotypes of BSH, BSHs with the highest RA in each phylotype were selected for molecular docking and enzyme activity assays (Additional file 2: Table S7). A lower binding energy (BD energy) of molecular docking usually indicated more stability of the complex, and the residues of eight representative BSH contact to seven substrates were extracted from the complex (Additional file 1: Figure S10-S17). From the results, BSH-T3 showed the most stable complex, containing all seven bile acids, and the residues of BSH-T3 contacted with substrates were Asp183, His212, His213, Leu214, and Pro215 (left panel of Fig. 5, Additional file 1: Figure S13).

Representative BSHs of the eight phylotypes were synthesized and purified (Additional file 1: Figure S9a) as described in the “Methods” section. The deconjugation of BSH at lowest concentration (0.1 mM) of substrates was confirmed by LC-MS/MS (right panel of Fig. 5, Additional file 2: Table S9). The results of enzyme activity assay shown that BSH-T0, BSH-T1, BSH-T3, BSH-T4, and BSH-T7 performed higher specific activity (the activity of an enzyme per milligram of total protein, using the highest enzyme activity as 100% for each substrate) among seven bile salts (middle and right panel of Fig. 5, Additional file 2: Table S8). However, different BSH phylotypes display selective deconjugation activity based on substrates. The specific activity of BSH-T5 was lower when the substrate was glycocholic acid (GCA) and both GCA and taurocholic acid (TCA) for BSH-T6 (middle and right panel of Fig. 5, Additional file 1: Figure S18). In particular, BSH-T1, BSH-T3, and BSH-T4 showed the highest specific activity with GCA, while BSH-T0 and BSH-T2 showed the highest specific activity with glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), and BSH-T0 showed the highest specific activity when taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) was the substrate (Additional file 1: Figure S18). It is worth noting that BSH-T1, which had the highest abundance of BSHs in the human gut microbiota, exhibited higher deconjugation activity (middle and right panel of Fig. 5). BSH-T2 showed lower enzyme activity both in silico and in vitro (Fig. 5, Additional file 1: Figure S12, S18). Comparatively, BSH-T7 showed higher deconjugation activity in vitro but not in silico (middle and right panel of Fig. 5, Additional file 1: Figure S17, S18). This discrepancy was likely because the computational molecular docking only partially reflected the actual enzyme activities. Nevertheless, computational work is helpful to understand the biological activity at the molecular level.

To further investigate the functional implications of BSH, we analyzed the relationship between the RA of BSHs and disease status of different groups, including populations of geographical regions and health/disease cohorts.

The gut metagenome data of the 11 worldwide populations presented above were extracted from the control group of various cohort studies as described in the “Methods” section. Therefore, we further explored the variation patterns of BSHs among health/disease cohorts (Fig. 6). In accordance with the population-level results, the RA of BSH showed no significant differences between healthy individuals and colorectal cancer (CRC), adenoma, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients other than Chinese (Additional file 1: Figure S20). However, the RA of BSH-T4 in Chinese with T2D was significantly higher than that of healthy individuals (pu = 0.038, Fig. 6a). Meanwhile, the RA of BSH-T3, BSH-T4, and BSH-T7 in populations with atherosclerosis (AS) were significantly higher (BSH-T3: pc = 1.2e-8; BSH-T4: pu = 0.028; BSH-T7: pu = 0.028), whereas the RA of BSH-T5 and BSH-T6 were significantly lower (BSH-T5: pu = 6.5e-7; BSH-T6: pu = 0.00075) than that of healthy individuals (Fig. 6b). These results indicated that BSH maybe had pleiotropic impact on the development and progression of AS. However, additional studies are required to derive a reasonable relationship between bile acid metabolism and various diseases.

In our study, BSH protein sequences (BSHs) were used for BLASTP searches to determine their sensitivity relative to other gene sequences. The average sequence identity of BSHs between genera was 44.46%, while it was 82.13% within genera (Additional file 1: Figure S3b). Thus, the BLOSUM45 matrix and cutoff of 45% homology were used build reference BSHs while ensuring all BSHs would be screened from the HMP database. Additionally, the BLOSUM62 with parameters of e-value 1e-5 and an identity of 62% as the cutoff were used to identify BSHs sequences in each individual to the accurate taxonomic assignments of BSHs in the human gut microbiota.

It should be noted that this study has several limitations: (1) the data quality among different metagenome databases is not consistent (e.g., sample sizes, sequencing depth, individuals selected, and standards differed); (2) the metagenome data lack individual dietary and other information such as data describing climate, local habitats, and lifestyle; (3) the individuals described by the metagenome data and epidemiological data of the WHO were not directly related in the populational-level correlation analysis; (4) the results of BSH activity comparison in silico and in vitro were not exactly identical; and (5) the in vivo effects of different BSHs on various bile acids were not evaluated. Despite the limitations, the results are still valid for two reasons: the activity of different BSHs is evaluated by substantial enzyme kinetics and confirmed by LC-MS/MS approach; the relationship of BSHs and diseases is assessed by both populational association and cohort study with big sample sizes.

In this study, we describe the distribution of bacteria that expressed BSH and discuss their distribution and abundance in worldwide populations. Based on the above series of analyses, we propose a new method to reclassify the BSHs and compare the enzyme activities between phylotypes. Moreover, we found the RA of some BSH phylotypes that are significantly correlated with T2D and AS, but the effects are pleiotropic, which highlights the importance of BSH classification in the future studies of BA metabolism-related diseases.

The known 3D structures of BSHs were searched in the protein data bank (PDB) [25] using the keyword “bile salt hydrolase” and “Choloylglycine hydrolase”. Only 12 of the 25 searched results are our purpose structures (Additional file 1: Figure S2b). Pairwise amino acid sequence alignments of the BSHs were performed by BLASTP (v 2.2.29+) [64], and multiple alignments were conducted using DNAMAN (v 8.0). The secondary structures of these BSHs were downloaded from PDBsum [65]. Comparison of 3D structures was conducted using MOE (v 2014).

The reference genomes of 1751 bacterial strains covering 1253 species were obtained from the HMP database [32] in September 2014. The genes and related proteins from these bacterial genomes were predicted by MetaGeneMark (v 2.8) [66], and the taxonomic information regarding these genes and proteins was directly extracted from the strain names.

The query BSH protein sequences were collected from the Refseq database of NCBI database [24] using the keyword “bile salt hydrolase” and “Choloylglycine hydrolase”. Then, the total number of amino acids in the sequences was limited between 300 and 400. The sequence identity interval of the BSHs between and within genera was calculated from these 765 sequences to define the thresholds. Thus, the final 591 BSHs reference sequences (screening was performed by controlling the total length of the sequences from 300 to 400) were identified from HMP database by taking the initial 765 BSH as query and using BLASTP with e-value of 1e-5 and sequence identity of 45% as cutoff (Additional file 1: Figure S2a).

The metagenomic sequence data of individuals were collected from 11 populations of six continents, including the Hadza ethnic group of Tanzania (HZ) of Africa [33, 67], China (CN) of Asia [50, 68], Japan (JP) of Asia [69], South Korea (KR) of Asia [70], Denmark (DK) of Europe [71], Sweden (SE) of Europe [72], Austria (AT) of Europe [56], France (FR) of Europe [73], Australia (AU, PRJEB6092) of Oceania, the United States (US) of North America (N-America) [21, 32], and Peru (PE) of South America (S-America) [74].

To study the differences in the BSH relative abundance (RA) between healthy individuals and patients, we used metagenomic datasets of individuals from different countries who were identified with diseases expected to be related to deviations in bile acids such as colorectal cancer (CRC), adenoma, type 2 diabetes (T2D), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and atherosclerosis (AS) [58] (Additional file 2: Table S3).

All raw sequencing reads were assessed and filtered using the FASTX-Toolkit, and the high quality microbiome sequencing reads were assembled with the SOAPdenovo2 (v 2.04) [77] package. After assembly, contigs with at least 500 bp were further used to predict the genes with MetaGeneMark (v 2.8), after which a non-redundant protein set was constructed by pair-wise comparison of all protein sequences within populations using BLASTP (v 35x1) [78] with 95% identity and 90% overlapping thresholds. The relative abundance (RA) of each protein sequence in each individual was calculated based on the number of read pairs mapped to the gene over the length of the protein sequence and divided by the summary of sequence abundance per individual [50]. The cumulative RA was calculated by the sum of RA of each genus in each population. The BSHs were identified in the above population database using BLASTP with an e-value = 1e-5 and 62% sequence identity as the cutoff values.

A phylogenetic tree was built using the maximum likelihood method in the MEGA software (v 7.0). Dendroscope (v 3.4.7) was used to embellish the phylogenetic tree by adjusting the labels and filling the colors as needed.

Nationwide blood cholesterol (2008), obese BMI (2014), diabetes death rate (per 100,000 individuals; 2012) and cardiovascular diseases death rate (per 100,000 individuals; 2012) data by country were downloaded from the World Health Organization (WHO) [79] (Additional file 2: Table S10).

The online software, Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine (Phyre2, V 2.04) [80], was employed to predict the homologous structure of BSHs using intensive mode [81]. Ligands including glycocholic acid (GCA, C26H43NO6), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA, C26H43NO5), glycine deoxycholic acid (GDCA, C26H43NO5), taurocholic acid (TCA, C26H45NO7S), taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA, C26H45NO6S), taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA, C26H45NO6S), and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, C26H45NO6S) were obtained from the ZINC database [82]. The AutoDock program (v 4.2.6) [83] was employed to generate an ensemble of docked conformations for each ligand bound to its target. Four units of BSH were found to bond with single bile acid substrate molecules by forming a tetramer. We then used the genetic algorithm for conformation searches and conducted 100 individual genetic algorithm (GA) runs to generate 100 docked conformations for each ligand.

Sodium glycocholate hydrate (CAS: 863-57-0), sodium glycochenodeoxycholate (CAS: 16564-43-5), sodium glycodeoxycholate (CAS: 16409-34-0), sodium taurocholate hydrate (CAS: 345909-26-4), sodium taurochnodeoxycholate (CAS: 6009-98-9), sodium taurodeoxycholate hydrate (CAS: 207737-97-1), sodium tauroursodeoxycholate (CAS: 35807-85-3), CA-d4 (CAS: 116380-66-6), DCA-d4 (CAS: 112076-61-6), CDCA-d4 (CAS: 99102-69-9), UDCA-d4 (CAS: 347841-46-7), glycine (CAS: 56-40-6), and taurine (CAS: 107-35-7) were used in the enzyme assay. pET28a (+) was used for the expression of His-tagged (6x) recombinant BSH (Genscript, Nanjing, China). The target BSH sequences were ligated into the NcoI/XhoI-digested vector pET28a (+) (T7 promoter), resulting in six recombinant plasmid pET28a (+)-bsh genes being transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells.

The eight bsh-recombinant bacteria were inoculated into Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing 50 μg·ml−1 kanamycin, and expression of the BSH genes was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG, 0.5 mM). The cell pellet obtained by harvesting was subsequently resuspended (1:10) in buffer solution (0.05 M Tris, 0.05 M NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5% Glycerol, pH 7.9) and disrupted by sonication (alternating pulses: on for 3 s, off for 3 s; 60% amplitude) until clear solutions were obtained.

The BSH was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) agarose column (HisTrap™ HP, GE Healthcare, USA). The presence and purity of BSH in each sample were confirmed by SDS-PAGE. After which pure BSH proteins were stored at − 80 °C after subsequently lyophilized.

The BSH specific activity was determined by measuring the release of amino acids (glycine and taurine) from conjugated bile salts. The amounts of amino acids liberated by BSH were determined by ninhydrin assay [84]. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford Protein Assay kit (Beyotime, Nanjing, China). The purified BSH-lyophilized powders were diluted with 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) until the concentration of BSH was 0.65 mg·ml−1. Next, 10 μl of BSH liquid, 10 μl of bile salts, and 180 μl of reaction buffer (20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.5) were mixed, and 10 μl of liquid paraffin were added. The samples were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, after which used 200 μl of 15% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid to terminate the reaction, and the sample was centrifuged to remove the precipitates. Mix 10 μl of reaction supernatant with 190 μl of ninhydrin reagent and kept in a boiling water bath for 15 min. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured in a 96-well plate. A standard BSH activity curve was subsequently prepared for glycine and taurine (Additional file 1: Figure S11b). One unit of BSH activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1 μmol of amino acid from the substrate per min.

Analysis was performed on a triple quadrupole tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system (LCMS8050, Shimadzu). Chromatographic separation was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm) column. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid (mobile phase A) in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (mobile phase B) running at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The gradient elution program was 5% B at 0–1 min, 5–42% at 1–2.5 min, 42–45% at 2.5–5.5 min, 45–60% at 5.5–8 min, 60–95% at 8-9 min, 95% at 9–9.5 min, back to initial conditions, and 2 min for equilibration. The column was maintained at 55 °C and the injection volume of each sample was 1 μl.

An isotope-labeled standard calibration approach with standard addition was used to avoid the matrix effects and ensure the accuracy of measurement. Calibration curves were constructed each day using seven calibrators prepared from pooled plasma spiked with CA, DCA, CDCA, and UDCA at concentration range of 0.00625–0.2 mM and CA-d4, DCA-d4, CDCA-d4, and UDCA-d4 at 0.003125 mM (Additional file 1: Figure S21, S22).

All values were expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistically significant differences between two groups were determined by Mann-Whitney U test followed by false discovery rate correction. The relation analysis was done with the Spearman rank correlations. Multiple comparisons were performed by multivariable-adjusted analysis using linear regression model. All analyses were performed using R (v 3.3.2), and p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
