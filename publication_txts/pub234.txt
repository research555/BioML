Randomized placebo-controlled trial of oral tannin supplementation on COVID-19 symptoms, gut dysbiosis and cytokine response



The clinical study aim was to investigate whether a tannin-based dietary supplementation could improve the efficacy of standard-of-care treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients by restoring gut microbiota function. Adverse events and immunomodulation post-tannin supplementation were also investigated. A total of 124 patients receiving standard-of-care treatment were randomized to oral tannin-based supplement or placebo for a total of 14 days. Longitudinal blood and stool samples were collected for cytokine and 16S rDNA microbiome profiling, and results were compared with 53 healthy controls. Although oral tannin supplementation did not result in clinical improvement or significant gut microbiome shifts after 14-days, a reduction in the inflammatory state was evident and significantly correlated with microbiota modulation. Among cytokines measured, MIP-1α was significantly decreased with tannin treatment (p = 0.03) where it correlated positively with IL-1β and TNF- α, and negatively with stool Bifidobacterium abundance.

The major organs affected in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) generally include the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Less well appreciated in COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) patients is the dysfunction evident in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract or onset of multiple organ failure (Chen et al., 2020, Gao et al., 2020). Disrupted crosstalk between the respiratory system and gut microbiota, termed the “gut-lung axis”, is reported in COVID-19 patients who generally display depletion of symbionts (i.e., Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp.) with enrichment of opportunistic pathobionts that correlate with disease severity (Xu et al., 2020, Zuo et al., 2020). Moreover, the exacerbated immune response in COVID-19 is strongly linked to gastrointestinal dysfunction and dysbiosis, which in turn can lead to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Villapol, 2020). Thus, the gut microbiota represents a potential target for therapy and diet could have a significant impact on the health status of the host.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and adverse events of a tannin-based dietary supplement added to standard-of-care treatment in patients with non-life-threatening COVID-19. The impact of oral tannin on dysbiosis and the systemic inflammatory response was also investigated. Furthermore, at baseline, the inflammation and gut microbiota of COVID-19 patients were compared with a cohort of non-COVID-19 controls.

The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Universidad de Buenos Aires “Hospital de Clínicas José de San Martín”, Argentina, and adhered to ethical principles outlined in the declaration of Helsinki convention. Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04403646), all protocol details are shown in Supplementary Figure S1 and reported previously by us (Molino, Pisarevsky, et al., 2021). Eligibility of study participants was assessed within 24 h of randomization, with patients and clinicians blinded to treatment. Computer-generated randomization (1:1) assigned tannin supplement or placebo, with sample size estimated at 140 (70 patients per group) based on a calculated alpha error of 5 % and power of 80 %. All COVID-19 participants continued to receive standard-of- care treatment based on the Argentina Ministry of Health and hospital treatment guidelines (Ministerio de Salud Argentina, n.d.). Such treatments included antiviral medications, antibacterial medications, steroids, supplementary oxygen, and convalescent plasma. Participants in the treatment arms received 2 capsules per day of tannin (240 mg of quebracho and chestnut tannin extract blend + 0.72 µg B12 vitamin; Arbox Microbiota, Indunor S.A.) or identical capsules of placebo for 14 days (see Fig. 1 ).

Non COVID-19 healthy controls (HC) were age and sex-matched individuals with no medical history or use of antibiotic or corticosteroid within 3 months and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. All authors had access to the study data and reviewed and approved the final manuscript.

The primary outcome measure was time to hospital discharge within 28-days (T28) of receiving the first oral treatment. Secondary outcome measures included: 28-day all-cause mortality, invasive ventilation at T28, measurement of systemic inflammatory cytokine levels, and fecal microbiota composition between baseline T0 and 14 days of intervention (T14).

Blood and stool samples were collected at T0 for both COVID-19 patients and HC, while sample collections were repeated at T14 for COVID-19 patients only. Venous blood samples were drawn into Vacutainer tubes containing clot activator and serum obtained by centrifugation (3,000 g for 15 min, 4 °C). Stool samples were collected in μb-eNAT preservation tubes (COPAN®, Italy) and stored at − 80 °C.

Cytokines were quantified using the commercial Bio-Plex Pro™ Human Cytokine 27-plex following kit instructions.

Microbial DNA was extracted from 100 mg of homogenized fecal samples using the MagMAX™ Microbiome Ultra Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions and was sequenced as described by Gaibani et al. (2021). DADA2 package (version 1.8) was used for processing de-multiplexed raw sequencing reads, with minor modifications (Klindworth et al., 2013). Specifically, raw sequencing reads were trimmed while maintaining the overlap regions for merging paired-end reads; sequencing primers retained in forward and reverse reads were removed. IdTaxa function in DECIPHER package (version 2.6.0) (Callahan et al., 2016) and its pre-built training set (LearnTaxa function) of SILVA database (release 132) (Murali et al., 2018) was used for taxonomy assignment (threshold: 0.5) of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from DADA2 output. ASVs that were not classified as bacteria and chimeras were removed. Samples with less than 1,000 reads were excluded and total sum scaling method was applied to normalize feature data prior to downstream analysis.

Data were analyzed using the independent t-test, Mann–Whitney U test or chi2 test depending on their distribution. Comparison of cytokine levels between COVID-19 patients and controls (with and without adjustment for age, sex, and BMI by linear regression) was analyzed by linear regression with Stata software (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas, USA) version 17.0. Time-to-event data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models while treatment effects for secondary outcome measures applying odds ratios.

Random forest algorithm in the random Forest R package together with 5-fold cross-validation sampling was used to generate a supervised classification model using serum cytokine profiles to differentiate COVID-19 patients from HC. Alpha diversity analysis and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distance were calculated at the ASV level using QIIME 1.9.1. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare alpha diversity metrics and ANOSIM non-parametric test was used to establish dissimilarity between groups. Relative abundances at each taxonomic level were compared by non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Spearman correlation analysis between serum cytokines and stool microbiome features at ASV and genus levels was performed using the R based cor.test() function, Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied as multiple testing corrections.

A total of 124 out of 143 screened COVID-19 patients were enrolled and randomized to receive oral tannin-based supplementation or placebo, added to standard-of-care treatment. Demographics of the study cohort are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The mean age of the HC group was 52 ± 8 years (62 % women), while the COVID-19 patients were 54 ± 15 years (50 % women). Four COVID-19 patients in the interventional arm and one patient in the placebo group withdrew from the study, due to protocol violation and adverse event respectively. The median interval between the onset of symptoms and randomization was 5 days (IQR, 4–7 days) overall.

Clinical characteristics did not present any significant differences between the interventional and placebo arms (Supplementary Table S2). Similarly, the primary (time to hospital discharge), and secondary outcomes (mortality, and invasive ventilation over a 28-day period from the start of the study) did not show significant differences between subjects supplemented with tannins or placebo (Supplementary Figure S2 and Table S3). No adverse events were recorded in the tannin group, whereas two patients reported diarrhea and abdominal pain in the placebo group.

At baseline, 17 cytokines were identified as differentially regulated in COVID-19 patients compared with HC (Supplementary Table S4). Hierarchical clustering and supervised learning accurately grouped COVID-19 patients from controls based on serum cytokine profiles, with an area-under-curve (AUC) value of 0.933 (Fig. 2 A & B). After adjusting for age ≥ 60, sex and body mass index ≥ 30, significantly higher pro-inflammatory cytokines levels were found in COVID-19 patients at baseline (T0) compared to HC: IL-1ra (p = 0.001), IL-2 (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p < 0.001), IL-7 (p < 0.001), IL- 8 (p = 0.05), IL-13 (p < 0.001), IP-10 (p < 0.001), PDGF-bb (p < 0.001). In particular, COVID-19 patients with severe disease had significantly higher levels of IL-1ra (p < 0.001), IL-13 (p < 0.001) and IFN-γ (p = 0.002), when compared to mild and moderate disease.

A reduction in IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-8, IL-9, IL-13, MCP-1, MIP-1β, PDGF-β, TNF-α and RANTES was measured in the tannin-treated COVID-19 arm, but these differences did not meet statistical significance (Fig. 2C). MIP-1α was the only cytokine that was significantly decreased in patients post tannin treatment (Fig. 2D) (Supplementary Table S5). Strong positive correlations between MIP-1α and IL-1β, rho = 0.58 (p < 0.001) and rho = 0.31 (p < 0.01), and between MIP-1α and TNF-α, rho = 0.23(p < 0.01) and rho = 0.41 (p < 0.01) were found in placebo and tannin arms, respectively.

Differences in gut microbiota composition between HC and COVID-19 patients at baseline T0 was evaluated in 152 subjects (50 HC and 102 COVID-19 subjects). COVID-19 patients receiving antibiotics with standard of care treatments did not present a distinct gut microbiota composition (Data not shown).

Spearman correlations of alpha-diversity and serum cytokine levels demonstrated that IL-15, MIP-1b, IFN-γ, IL-1rα, FGF-β, IL-9, IP-10, IL-6, IL-13, PDGF-ββ and IL-2 were statistically associated with Shannon diversity index after multiple testing correction. Out of these, six cytokines negatively and five positively correlated with alpha diversity (Fig. 3F).

Shannon and Chao1 alpha-diversity indices were not altered in COVID-19 patients after tannin intervention (Fig. 4 A & B). Similarly, no significant changes were evident in beta-diversity clustering based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity-based analysis (Fig. 4C). Burkholderiaceae was significantly (p = 0.0015) elevated at T14 in patients after 14-days tannin treatment (Fig. 4D), as was Enterococcus (LDA score 3.095) and Allisonella (LDA score 2.733) whereas Lachnospiraceae (LDA score 2.676) demonstrated reduced abundance in the tannin-arm (Fig. 4E).

When assessing microbiome composition with cytokine levels, a significant negative correlation between serum MIP-1α and stool Bifidobacterium was noted, especially with ASV103 which showed 100 % identity to Bifidobacterium longum (Fig. 4F).

Continuously emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants contributing to COVID-19 being endemic in several countries, indicates that we must learn to coexist with this disease. Prevention and control measures other than vaccination are therefore needed. Dietary intervention represents one of the most realistic approaches to broadly manage the body's exacerbated inflammatory state to COVID-19 by maintaining a well-balanced gut microbiota. In the present study, we investigated this concept by testing the efficacy of oral tannin supplementation in COVID-19 patients with mild-to-severe disease severity.

Taking all these results together, they indicate that tannin supplementation may be more amenable to chronic illness such as long-COVID where longer treatment duration is merited, and patients are less likely to marked dysbiosis.

In this study, a tannin supplementation was administered to 124 COVID-19 patients receiving standard-of-care treatment. Comparison of the patients with 53 healthy volunteers showed that the COVID-19 patients were characterized by a pronounced intestinal dysbiosis and high inflammatory status.

Although the short course of oral tannin supplementation (14 days) failed to provide significant clinical improvement or favorable hospital discharge rate after 28 days, oral tannins were associated with a decrease in systemic inflammation correlated with fecal Bifidobacterium abundance. Our study sets the stage for future clinical investigation of prophylactic nutraceutical management of COVID-19 symptoms, through precision restoration of gut microbiota members that modulate adverse host immune responses to infection.
