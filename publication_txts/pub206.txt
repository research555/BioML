Gut Microbiota, Muscle Mass and Function in Aging: A Focus on Physical Frailty and Sarcopenia

Human gut microbiota is able to influence the host physiology by regulating multiple processes, including nutrient absorption, inflammation, oxidative stress, immune function, and anabolic balance. Aging is associated with reduced microbiota biodiversity, increased inter-individual variability, and over-representation of pathobionts, and these phenomena may have great relevance for skeletal muscle mass and function. For this reason, the presence of a gut-muscle axis regulating the onset and progression of age-related physical frailty and sarcopenia has been recently hypothesized. In this narrative review, we summarize the studies supporting a possible association between gut microbiota-related parameters with measures of muscle mass, muscle function, and physical performance in animal models and humans. Reduced muscle mass has been associated with distinct microbiota composition and reduced fermentative capacity in mice, and the administration of probiotics or butyrate to mouse models of muscle wasting has been associated with improved muscle mass. However, no studies have targeted the human microbiome associated with sarcopenia. Limited evidence from human studies shows an association between microbiota composition, involving key taxa such as Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium, and grip strength. Similarly, few studies conducted on patients with parkinsonism showed a trend towards a different microbiota composition in those with reduced gait speed. No studies have assessed the association of fecal microbiota with other measures of physical performance. However, several studies, mainly with a cross-sectional design, suggest an association between microbiota composition and frailty, mostly assessed according to the deficit accumulation model. Namely, frailty was associated with reduced microbiota biodiversity, and lower representation of butyrate-producing bacteria. Therefore, we conclude that the causal link between microbiota and physical fitness is still uncertain due to the lack of targeted studies and the influence of a large number of covariates, including diet, exercise, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy, on both microbiota composition and physical function in older age. However, the relationship between gut microbiota and physical function remains a very promising area of research for the future.

Sarcopenia is an age-related generalized skeletal muscle disorder characterized by loss of muscle mass and a reduction of muscle function, increasing the risk of negative outcomes such as falls, fractures, disability and mortality [1,2]. This condition frequently overlaps with physical frailty [3], representing the reduction of the capacity to maintain fitness, physical performance and sense of well-being over time and particularly after stressors such as acute illnesses [4]. In fact, frail older patients frequently experience a decline in muscle strength, gait speed and endurance capacity [5,6], ultimately leading to the loss of independence in daily activities, increased risk of falls, fractures, hospital admissions, and death [7]. Although sarcopenia and physical frailty remain two distinct conditions with different diagnostic criteria, they share a common pathophysiological background and, from the patient’s perspective, are associated with similar negative outcomes [3,8]. Therefore, they are increasingly viewed as two sides of the same coin.

In some patients, sarcopenia and physical frailty may coexist with reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and excess adipose tissue, in a clinical picture that has been recently defined as osteosarcopenic obesity [17,18]. One of the main features of this syndrome is the presence of adipose tissue and adipose cells within the muscle structure, the so-called “myosteatosis” [17]. Myosteatosis represents the result of increased systemic anabolic resistance and is independently associated with increased mortality risk according to population-based studies [19,20].

In this scenario, researchers are increasingly focusing their interests on the possible involvement of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of physical frailty and sarcopenia. Alterations in the gut microbiota composition could in fact promote chronic inflammation and anabolic resistance, ultimately conditioning reduced muscle size, impaired muscle function and adverse clinical outcomes [21,22]. In this possible gut-muscle axis, age-associated dysfunction of the gut mucosal barrier function may play a central role [23], favoring the entry of microbial products or microbes themselves into systemic circulation [24], and contributing to activate the inflammatory response and induce immune system dysregulation [25,26].

Papers were searched for on PubMed as of 1 June 2019, using the following key terms: microbiota AND “muscle function”; microbiota AND sarcopenia; microbiota AND “muscle mass”; microbiota AND “muscle wasting”; microbiota AND frailty; microbiota AND “gait speed”; microbiota AND “muscle strength”; microbiota AND “grip strength”; microbiota AND “physical performance”. Due to the low number of human studies performed on the topic, and to heterogeneity of settings, participants and outcome measures, a systematic review approach was not possible. Thus, human studies relevant for the primary aim of the review were discussed, considering also animal studies relevant for the explanation of possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the gut-muscle axis.

Studies performed on mouse models have shown that the intestinal microbiota consistently influences the host metabolic balance. Germ-free mice exhibit a persistently lean phenotype even when fed a high-fat diet [49]. Transplantation of fecal microbiota from undernourished humans to germ-free mice also resulted in growth deficits even in the presence of a balanced diet [50]. Finally, transplantation of the intestinal microbiota from pigs to lean germ-free mice resulted in significant changes of muscle fibers structure, resembling to that typical of pigs [51]. Thus, the microbiota may act as a fundamental transducer of nutrient signals to the host and, in physiological situations, diet itself contributes to shape microbiota composition and functionality [52].

The relationship between protein intake and microbiota composition, and the subsequent consequences for the host metabolism, are thus very complex and not fully understood. The effects of protein intake on the gut microbiota composition, and the consequences for muscle mass deposition, may depend on protein quality and microbiota metabotype [54], so that the pro-anabolic response to protein intake, mediated by the microbiota, may be different on an individual basis.

Very few studies have directly assessed the possible association between gut microbiota composition and muscle mass, or the effects of microbiota manipulations on muscle mass, and all of them have been performed in animal models. Siddhart et al. [63] have demonstrated that rats with age-related sarcopenia exhibit a distinct gut microbiota composition compared to rats with a normal muscle mass. The sarcopenic rat microbiota also showed different functionalities, with reduced representation of genes involved in carbohydrate, protein, lipid digestion, and vitamin biosynthesis [63]. The reduced bioavailability of macronutrients and vitamins possibly associated with these age-related functional changes may play a relevant pathophysiological role in determining a reduction of muscle mass, as hypothesized by some authors [21,22].

Although the possibility that the intestinal microbiota represents an active modulator of muscle mass deposition is intriguing from a pathophysiological and clinical point of view, the circumstance that microbes develop symbiotic relationship with the host should also be considered. Therefore, sarcopenia-associated changes in gut microbiota composition and functionality, as those observed in animal studies [63,64,65], may simply reflect the consequence of a reduced metabolic capacity of the host, or the consequence of sarcopenia itself. This hypothesis has not been verified either in animal or human studies. However, reduced physical activity and exercise, representing a common feature of sarcopenic subjects, are independently associated with unfavorable changes in microbiota composition [74], suggesting, as discussed further, a bidirectional cross-talk between muscle and gut microbiota.

Reduction in muscle strength is an important characteristic of sarcopenia and physical frailty, concurring to determine the age-related decline in physical performance [75,76]. For clinical purposes, muscle strength is evaluated by measuring the hand-grip strength of the dominant side with a hand-held dynamometer [77]. This parameter physiologically declines with aging, but its reductions are generally more pronounced in those who fulfil criteria for sarcopenia and physical frailty [78,79].

In summary, an association between human gut microbiota composition and muscle strength is probable, with Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium as the most important putative players. The existence of a cross-feeding interaction between these two genera, so that the capacity of butyrate synthesis by Faecalibacterium is mediated by the abundance of Bifidobacteria [70], should be also considered in the possible muscle strength-microbiota association. However, more studies are needed before we can conclude that the microbiota is a clinically significant determinant of muscle strength in aging.

The walking speed is considered a fundamental parameter related to the health status of older patients [77,89]. In fact, it is able to predict the onset of mobility-disability and mortality, and correlates with the clinical course of several chronic illnesses [90]. The association of slow gait speed (≤0.8 m/s) with incident disability has been particularly emphasized, although the cut-offs may be different in different settings and populations [91]. Recent studies also suggest that the association between gait speed and health outcomes is mediated by the habitual level of physical activity [92].

Moreover, gait speed represents a functional parameter that does not depend only on muscle strength and function, but also on central nervous system function. In aging, the microbiota is able to influence the brain physiology through multiple mechanisms, that have been recently reviewed by Ticinesi et al. [100] and Calvani et al. [101]. These mechanisms may also be important for the presence of frailty [100] and influence gait speed and functional dependence of older individuals. Namely, the capacity of gut bacteria to produce neurotransmitters, including γ-amino butyric acid, norepinephrine and dopamine, and to modulate the host production of serotonin, seems relevant for the association between microbiota composition and gait speed [102]. Thus, the associations, shown in Table 1, may not depend solely on the gut-muscle axis, but also on the microbial influences on the brain.

The assessment of physical performance is of paramount importance in geriatrics. In addition to gait speed measurement, other simple motoric tests are recommended. The most popular ones are chair-stand test, timed up-and-go test, and the Short-Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), combining three different tests (4-m walking speed, chair-stand test, balance evaluation) [77]. Alterations in the physical performance in each one of these tests, and particularly SPPB, is associated with disability, nursing home admission, falls and mortality [103,104,105]. SPPB test score performs particularly well in predicting incident disability, with a significantly higher accuracy than the measurement of gait speed alone [106]. SPPB also predicts cognitive disability [107], since physical and cognitive function are strictly inter-related [108].

Similar intervention studies were performed in healthy adults, evaluating physical performance by measuring endurance capacity, which is not part of standard geriatric assessment [88,109]. Other studies focused on the effects of probiotic administration on the physical performance of athletes, but their results were conflicting [110,111]. However, experiments in animal models support the concept that modulation of the intestinal microbiota is associated with improved fitness and endurance, and reduced fatigability [112,113].

In the existing studies centered on older subjects, the physical performance was evaluated in the context of frailty. Namely, frailty was operationalized in accordance with the deficit accumulation model, and most studies used the Rockwood Frailty Index as the preferred method of assessment, overlooking more specific measures of muscle function or performance [47,114,115,116,117,118,119,120]. The studies, summarized in Table 2, supported the existence of an association between frailty and fecal microbiota composition, though with different characteristics [47,114,115,116,117,118,119,120].

The most evident limitation of these investigations is the methodology of assessment of physical performance. The Rockwood Frailty Index and Clinical Frailty Scale do not directly assess muscle function and performance, focusing on the presence and number of functional deficits, not involving only locomotion [124]. Thus, the results of the studies summarized in Table 2 do not allow to infer a direct association of gut microbiota composition with muscle performance in aging. However, frailty indexes are significantly associated with objective measures of muscle performance, particularly balance and chair-stand test [125,126]. Moreover, the only study, among those summarized in Table 2, where the Fried criteria were used to classify frailty, concluded that physical frailty is much more strongly associated with gut microbiota composition than cognitive frailty [119]. However, correlations between microbiota composition and objective measures of muscle performance were not assessed in that study [119].

Existing studies suggest that the gut microbiota is associated with physical performance in aging, and that the association may be double-way [127]. Frailty and mobility-disability are in fact associated with different degrees of dysbiosis, while individuals with successful aging, such as centenarians, exhibit a fecal microbiota composition that matches the one of healthy adults [46,128,129]. These concepts support the existence of a gut-muscle axis [22], as also suggested by the only randomized controlled trial where a microbiome-centered intervention (the administration of a prebiotic blend) was associated with improved frailty index [120]. From this perspective, the gut microbiota may be actively involved in the physiopathology of sarcopenia and physical frailty, and could represent a reasonable therapeutic target [48,130].

The intestinal microbiota is a very complex ecosystem, and its description in terms of biodiversity, taxonomy and relative abundance of taxa may not be sufficient for understanding its interactions with the host. Recent animal studies have shown that the host fitness is regulated by functional interactions among species, not by a single or a limited group of taxa [139], and that the metabolic byproducts of intestinal bacteria have a great relevance in prolonging healthspan [140]. The understanding of the possible pathophysiological role of gut microbiota in physical frailty and sarcopenia should carefully consider these aspects.

The presence of a gut-muscle axis actively involved in the pathophysiology of physical frailty and sarcopenia is biologically plausible and is supported by a limited number of animal and human studies; however, the causal link remains uncertain. An association between human gut microbiota composition and muscle mass has not been demonstrated yet. In some studies, an association between microbiota composition and parameters of muscle function, such as strength, gait speed and timed up and go test, was demonstrated, while an association between microbiota and physical frailty, assessed in accordance with the deficit accumulation model, seems probable. The relationship between gut microbiota and physical performance in aging needs further investigation before it can reasonably influence clinical practice.
