Gut microbiome in neuropsychiatric disorders



Neuropsychiatric disorders are a significant cause of death and disability worldwide. The mechanisms underlying these disorders include a constellation of structural, infectious, immunological, metabolic, and genetic etiologies. Advances in next-generation sequencing techniques have demonstrated that the composition of the enteric microbiome is dynamic and plays a pivotal role in host homeostasis and several diseases. The enteric microbiome acts as a key mediator in neuronal signaling via metabolic, neuroimmune, and neuroendocrine pathways.

In this review, we aim to present and discuss the most current knowledge regarding the putative influence of the gut microbiome in neuropsychiatric disorders.

We examined some of the preclinical and clinical evidence and therapeutic strategies associated with the manipulation of the gut microbiome.

targeted taxa were described and grouped from major studies to each disease.

Understanding the complexity of these ecological interactions and their association with susceptibility and progression of acute and chronic disorders could lead to novel diagnostic biomarkers based on molecular targets. Moreover, research on the microbiome can also improve some emerging treatment choices, such as fecal transplantation, personalized probiotics, and dietary interventions, which could be used to reduce the impact of specific neuropsychiatric disorders. We expect that this knowledge will help physicians caring for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.











Over the past decade, microbiomics have emerged as a new field led by advances in culture-independent methods and next-generation sequencing technologies. These methods have provided a broader understanding of how the interaction between microbes and humans can profoundly influence host homeostasis and different disease states1. The literature has reflected the growing number of studies on the putative influence of the microbiome on human health and disease (Figure 1). In humans, bacteria are the most prevalent domain, and it has been estimated that the ratio of microbes to human cells in an adult is nearly 1:12. The human microbiome is defined as the compendium of microbial communities (including bacteria, archaea, viruses, protozoa, and fungi) living in a given body niche3,4.

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is considered the organ that harbors the highest amount of commensal microorganisms, reaching 1013 bacteria/mL2. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Verrumicrobia, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria have been identified as the core enterotypes at the phylum level, which consist of more than 1000 species3. These consortia tend to remain steady throughout adult life, but preclinical evidence in both animals and humans have revealed that pre-and post-natal colonization of the gut has specific signatures and interindividual variations (~20%), depending on critical events such as maternal conditions, perinatal infections, mode of delivery, breastfeeding, diet, antibiotic exposure, and host genetics5,6.

Different approaches comparing germ-free mice and conventionally colonized controls demonstrated that the abnormal composition of the gut microbiota led to functional and structural changes in the gastrointestinal tract. A variety of morphological defects on mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and intestinal microvasculature, including reducing the number of Paneth cells, Peyer’s patches, and villi size, were already described in mice models10. Similarly, the loss of microbial diversity can negatively affect the expression of genes related to nutrient absorption, mucosal cellularity, and barrier fortification11. In vitro and in vivo studies have examined the importance of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) present on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells and immune T cells12. The signaling transmission mediated by TLRs can also modulate mechanisms encompassing the host’s tolerance to commensal bacteria and the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1B (IL-1B)13. These findings have been classically associated with several GI disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn’s disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC), as well as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD), and colorectal cancer (CRC)14,15. Besides, observational studies have indicated that the loss of beneficial microorganisms affects ecological interactions among local populations and drive systemic diseases. Some of the metabolic processes that are impaired in patients with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are associated with the synthesis of vitamins, xenobiotic transformation, and bacteria-derived molecules production, including secondary bile acids and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) production16,17.

The human gut contains its own neural system, consisting of more than one hundred million neuron cells (108)18. Crosstalk between the central nervous system (CNS) and the gut microbiome is known as the gut microbiota-brain axis, and it is orchestrated at different anatomical levels. It occurs through an intricate network of afferent and efferent circuits alongside the vagus nerve, enteric nervous system, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Thus, the gut connectome integrates neuroendocrine, enteroendocrine, neuroimmune, and metabolic signaling pathways responsible for regulating functions associated with digestion, tract motility, and brain development. Furthermore, gut microbes can control host responses to vascular injury and autoimmunity by modifications in both the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain lymphatic system7,15.

Additionally, evidence from intervention studies in germ-free mice, where a diverse microbiota is absent, has also shown the great potential that microorganisms have in regulating microglia differentiation and maturation. Other features commonly displayed in gnotobiotic models are the abnormal expression of proteins related to synaptic plasticity, such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the impairment in global cognition responses. For instance, in a study carried out by Möhle et al., the authors pointed out that adult hippocampal neurogenesis and global cognition responses can be restored after oral supplementation with probiotics via expansion of Ly6C+ monocytes19,20. Notably, it has been reported that microbial metabolites such as SCFAs, secondary bile acids, precursors of the lipid biosynthesis (propionate), and specific amino acids (tryptophan) are critical in modulating the release of host cytokines and hormones such as peptide YY, vasoactive intestinal peptide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and melatonin, as well as neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT), catecholamines, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). All of these affect brain functions related to feeding, stress response, emotional behaviors, aging, and cognition17,21. Furthermore, intestinal dysbiosis appears to be linked to the development of brain autoimmunity driven by specific T cell subtypes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, endothelial barrier impairment, and neurodegeneration7,22. The next section will explore some of the neuropsychiatric disorders thought to be influenced by microbiome disturbances.

Previous studies have linked T helper 17 cells (Th17) to MS pathogenesis through its effect in exacerbating experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Regulatory T cells (Treg) have an essential role in suppressing inflammation in the CNS in EAE models22,23. Cekanaviciute et al. have identified increased EAE disease scores and deficient IL-10+ Treg induction in mice colonized with microbiota from patients with MS24. Furthermore, some butyrate-producing bacteria, mainly belonging to the Firmicutes phylum, have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of MS. Butyrate is known to inhibit pro-inflammatory pathways and prevent systemic exposure to intestinal antigens25. Bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium from the Firmicutes phylum, were found to be reduced in MS patients26.

More recently, the interaction between microbiome and diet in MS has attracted attention. A study found an association between a lower number of relapses and a lower disability status scale after one year of a high vegetable/low protein diet (HV/LP diet) when compared with a classical Western diet characterized by regular consumption of red meat, processed meat, refined grains, sweetened food, salt, and saturated and omega-6 fatty acids. The HV/LP group had higher levels of bacteria from the Lachnospiraceae genus, and they were positively related to Treg cells29. Table 1 summarizes the most relevant microbiome findings in patients with MS.

Immuno-mediated encephalitis is an emergent group of syndromes characterized by the development of acute or subacute progressive encephalopathy (less than three months onset) that occurs due to an abnormal antibody response against cell-surface, intracellular synaptic, or intraneuronal (nuclear or cytoplasmic) antigens30,31.

Enrichment of the genus Fusobacterium was also reported in the anti-NMDAR AE. Fusobacteria species comprise gram-negative anaerobic bacilli, which are considered normal microbiota in oral cavity, GI, and urogenital tract. However, recent studies report that F. nucleatum can present pathogenic properties that have been implicated in oral and extraoral diseases, including neurological disorders32. It is believed that adhesion and invasion via hematogenous translocation are the primary strategies used by F. nucleatum to activate inflammatory and oncogenic genes, thus contributing to disease development and progression35.

Studies have shown that up to 50% of patients with stroke suffer from GI complications, which has a strong association with patient recovery, deterioration of neurological functions, and mortality36. These features regarding stroke make it an interesting condition to look for associations between brain and gut microbiota. Indeed, several studies have shown a link between stroke outcomes and microbiota regulation of the immune system and metabolism37,38,39 (Table 2).

Although the results are encouraging, as described above, additional studies with larger samples and different ethnic backgrounds are needed to validate these findings. However, if further confirmed, a careful approach, including microbiome screening as a possible preventive target for stroke management is needed.

Studies in germ-free animals exposed to microbial infections, human post-mortem brain samples, and microbiome analysis of living humans have revealed that disorder of the gut microbiota may underlie the development or exacerbation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology47. Also, available data suggest that the gut microbiota in AD is characterized by a substantial reduction in beneficial microbial diversity and presence of pathogenic species such as Proteobacteria phylum, especially the Enterobacteriaceae family48. These shifts in microbial diversity may activate immune cells and stimulate overproduction of toxic metabolites or pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to the destruction of the GI mucosa. It is well known that chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation precede cognitive decline by years49. Increased inflammation makes gut microorganisms move from the GI tract through cells overlying the Peyer’s patches into blood and other tissues (a process known as atopobiosis)47. Likewise, systemic inflammation can increase BBB permeability, exposing the brain to cytokines that can lead to neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death, promoting neurodegenerative diseases48,50. Initially, the brain can resist, but the regenerative capacity, together with the microglia’s ability to clear toxic metabolites, decreases with time49.

The role of diet in these mechanisms is still poorly understood but probably extremely important47. Dietary patterns similar to the Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension have been associated with a reduced risk of AD56. In contrast, a Western-style diet represents a risk factor. The variety and composition of a diet and long-term dietary habits may influence the gut microbiota composition and shape the microbial community51. A newly proposed insight is that the transplantation of fecal microflora from healthy people to patients with AD can help restore the intestinal microbiota and reduce the negative impact of the dysbiotic microbiome on the gut and brain functions47. The influence of gut microbiota on brain function is being investigated continuously. Table 3 presents additional studies on the role of gut microbiota and dementia.

About one-third of patients with epilepsy have seizures refractory to anti-seizure drugs (ASD)57. Non-pharmacological approaches, especially the ketogenic diet (KD), are alternatives in cases of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. The KD has been used for about one hundred years, demonstrating efficacy in reducing seizure frequency, mostly in children with difficult-to-control epilepsy58.

So far, all of the studies involving different epilepsy phenotypes either in humans or mice report changes in the intestinal microbiome at baseline or after a KD69. Still, there is little overlap across these studies in the exact microbial signatures that have been identified (Table 4). Thus, additional high-powered and well-controlled studies are needed to explore the issue better and propose new treatment options70,71.

It is well known that patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) present severe non-motor symptoms at the prodromal phase of the disease, which are determinants of the quality of life in these individuals. Sensorial, neuropsychiatric, sleep dysfunction, and GI symptoms (constipation) are the most common phenotypes describe in this category72. Several studies using breath testing demonstrated that a considerable proportion of patients with PD have intestinal bacterial overgrowth and absorption issues, leading to intestinal constipation. On the other hand, 16S ribosomal RNA analysis from colonic biopsies and stool samples of adults with PD showed decreased SCFAs-producing bacteria such as Blautia, Coprococcus, and Roseburia73,74. Furthermore, depletion or increase in Prevotella and Lactobacillus genera was reported in several case-control studies performed in these patients75,76. This class of beneficial microorganisms is involved in BBB integrity, permeability, and neuronal inflammatory signaling73. Moreover, the increase in Enterobacteriaceae members was directly proportional to the severity of symptoms like stability, gait, and rigidity77. Conversely, in a study conducted in individuals with PD, the oral microbiome was analyzed. Male patients exhibited an increase in the abundance of Prevotella, which is considered an opportunistic pathobiont on the mouth, suggesting a strong role of these genera in periodontal disease78. Taken together, these findings support that modifications in bacteria density, taxonomic levels (dysbiosis), and mucin production may, in turn, boost the neuroglia system, triggering damage to the intestinal and brain barriers, leading to alpha-synuclein protein misfolding and finally aggregation. Likewise, chronic systemic exposure to LPS leads to the selective death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra73,79,80.

Several studies have been published exploring the gut microbiome in PD (Table 5). However, the need for well-designed clinical studies exploring the role of the gut microbiome in PD in the clinical setting is still lacking.

Clinical observations indicate that patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have GI disturbances that include diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain83. Likewise, a growing number of studies have shown that patients with ASD have an altered gut microbiota composition compared to neurotypical individuals84. Moreover, GI disturbances strongly correlate with the severity of ASD symptoms, and GI disturbances are markedly associated with GI dysbiosis83,84. Therefore, it has been suggested that gut microbiota alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of ASD(69). Although several studies have shown that adult rodents prenatally exposed to VPA, a model for ASD, exhibit gut dysbiosis85,86, there is a lack of evidence of a causal link between abnormal microbiota and ASD-like behaviors.

Patients with schizophrenia commonly have GI disturbances, such as constipation and GI hypomotility and inflammation87,88. A growing body of evidence indicates that altered gut microbiota may account for the GI disturbances and the severity of symptoms in schizophrenia patients suggesting a key role of the gut microbiota in promoting the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Interestingly, this suggestion has been recently proved by Zheng and colleagues. In this study, the authors found that the gut microbiota from patients with schizophrenia induced behavioral alterations and modulated brain excitability when transferred to mice89. Other studies have also suggested that GI disturbances and gut microbiota alterations in schizophrenia may be related to the use of antipsychotic medication90. However, gut microbiota seems to be altered in patients even before medication91. Hence, to better understand the gut microbiota alterations in schizophrenia, experimental validation of clinical findings seems necessary. Furthermore, animal models of schizophrenia reinforce the clinical data showing that gut dysbiosis may be implicated in schizophrenia, mainly pointing to alterations in the Firmicutes phylum bacteria.

Preclinical studies have shown that the intestinal microbiome seems to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of both neuropsychiatric disorders. Also, fecal microbiota from patients diagnosed with anxiety and depression induce behavioral and physiological features of these disorders when transplanted to microbiota-deficient animals, including anhedonia, anxiety-like behaviors, and altered tryptophan metabolism92,93,94.

Park and colleagues showed that anxiety-and depression-like behaviors induced by olfactory bulbectomy (OBx) are related to colonic motility alterations and gut microbiota composition changes. In addition, the expression of hypothalamic corticotropin-hormone (CRH) was elevated in OBx mice, suggesting that GI disturbances and gut dysbiosis may be due to the recruitment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis95,96. Murakami et al. analyzed the gut microbiota composition of fecal samples from Wistar rats submitted to maternal separation when neonates. This early-life stressor leads to anxiety-and depression-like behaviors in adulthood. The authors found that maternal separation induced a specific reduction in Bifidobacterium, Bacteroidetes, and Prevotella genera97. Li et al. analyzed the gut microbiota of fecal samples from mice submitted to the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model. They found that the gut microbiota of CUMS-treated mice exhibits drastic alterations in microbiota composition, including an increased α-diversity and changes in the abundance of specific microbial phyla, such as Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria. At the genus level, animals exposed to CUMS exhibit an increased abundance in Helicobacter, Turicibacter, Parasutterella, Alistipes, Odoribacter, and Akkermansia, but a decrease in Barnesiella, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Olsenella98.

Reports using cutting-edge technologies such as metagenomics and metabolomics are changing some of the established paradigms regarding the physiopathological mechanisms behind neuropsychiatric diseases. Using the potential of microbial profiles as biomarkers of neurological and mental health disorders may maximize the efficacy of existing therapies. Current challenges remain in establishing causation rather than association and translating basic science studies into clinical practice with the potential of targeting the microbiome for therapeutic purposes.
