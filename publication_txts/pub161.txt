The human microbiome in evolution

The trillions of microbes living in the gut—the gut microbiota—play an important role in human biology and disease. While much has been done to explore its diversity, a full understanding of our microbiomes demands an evolutionary perspective. In this review, we compare microbiomes from human populations, placing them in the context of microbes from humanity’s near and distant animal relatives. We discuss potential mechanisms to generate host-specific microbiome configurations and the consequences of disrupting those configurations. Finally, we propose that this broader phylogenetic perspective is useful for understanding the mechanisms underlying human–microbiome interactions.

We are in the midst of a revolution in our understanding of the human microbiome (Box 1). A decade ago, very little was known of the inventory of microbes that inhabit different parts of the human body, how they assemble into communities of varying levels of complexity, and how they relate to microbiomes in other species. Recent improvements in technology for collecting and analyzing DNA sequence data make these questions accessible for the first time. Various aspects of the microbiome have been correlated to a surprising number of human diseases [1], and some microbiome-centric interventions have shown extraordinary efficacy in treatment of specific disorders like recurrent Clostridium difficile infection [2]. More broadly, this wealth of additional data has drawn attention to the connections between microbes and foundational elements of organismal biology and ecology [3]. Given the rush to apply knowledge of the human microbiome in fields ranging from medicine to forensics, there has been a heavy emphasis on practical applications of microbiome sequencing, largely from North American and European populations. However, as in many other areas of biology, a true understanding of these patterns and processes requires an evolutionary perspective.

To address these questions, we first describe the human gut microbiome and its contents. We then place this information in the context of our closest relatives, the primates, and more distant relatives, mammals. Then we discuss the consequences of modifying species-specific microbiomes, and some of the mechanisms underlying this process. Finally, we point the way to microbiome studies that can better take into account the evolutionary properties of hosts, microbes, and their symbioses to improve our knowledge both of the underlying biology and for practical applications in human and animal health.

Although the 6.5 meter human digestive tract consists of three organs—the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine—most human microbiome research focuses on the microbial community (the microbiota) of the large intestine as read out through the stool. This community harbors by far the greatest microbial biomass of any organ or surface of the human body. Each milliliter of the large intestine holds approximately 1011 microbial cells compared to 108 cells in the small intestine [4]. Typically, researchers turn to non-invasive fecal samples as proxies for the distal colon microbiome. These samples contain a mixture of microbes and human colonocytes from along the length of the digestive tract and have a similar, albeit distinct, composition to intestinal biopsies [5, 6].

The second question that arises is: Do these differences between populations matter? Are they larger than expected for a species that eats diets and lives in environments as variable as our own? To answer this, it is useful to compare human microbiomes to our close evolutionary relatives, the non-human primates.

Despite the evolutionary relevance, surprisingly few studies systematically compare human and non-human primate gut microbiomes. Directly comparing primate and human microbiomes offers insights into what factors shaped our microbiome throughout our evolutionary past. The data that exist demonstrate that, in contrast to our most recent common ancestors, African apes, humans have lower gut microbiota diversity, increased relative abundances of Bacteroides, and reduced relative abundances of Methanobrevibacter and Fibrobacter [32, 33]. Many of these traits are associated with carnivory in other mammals, suggesting that a human dietary shift toward meat-eating over evolutionary timescales may have been accompanied by associated gut microbial shifts [34, 35]. Comparing primate and human microbiomes also provides an indication of how quickly the human microbiome is changing. The human gut microbiome composition appears to have diverged from the ancestral state at an accelerated pace compared to that of the great apes [33]. Some of the hallmarks of human evolution and history potentially responsible include cooked food, the advent of agriculture, population size and density increases, and physiological changes such as the human-specific loss of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc).

In this sense, studies of captive primates with artificially manipulated diets provide helpful context for understanding human dietary transitions. Several studies including our own find that captive primates consume less diverse, lower-fiber diets compared to their wild counterparts [42, 44, 45], mirroring the gradual transition to low-fiber diets over the course of human evolution and the stark contrast of modern Western and non-Western diets. One study reports that the low-fiber captive diet provided to howler monkeys and douc langurs results in a “humanization” of the gut microbiome, as characterized by the loss of microbial diversity [41, 44]. However, even with the low-fiber diet, the howler and douc microbiomes were more similar to non-Western than Western human microbiomes, indicating that the relationship between host diet and the gut microbiota differs between human and non-human primates when considering specific microbial taxa. Our own study comparing the gut microbiomes of vervets and humans consuming both high- and low-fiber diets reports similar results [41]. In contrast to observations of Western versus non-Western human populations [14], Bacteroides relative abundances are lower in captive animals with low-fiber diets [44], while Prevotella relative abundances are higher. These data indicate that closely related microbial taxa may have evolved to encode different metabolic functions in humans and non-human primate microbiomes. Given the overall similarities among primate microbiomes, targeting these related but contrasting lineages for more detailed genomic and functional characterization offers unique opportunities for understanding both the overall function of the human microbiome as well as how evolution of its constituents impacts human health.

The association between diet and phylogeny among primate microbiomes echoes the larger patterns of diversity among vertebrate gut communities, as evidenced by looking at convergence of dietary transitions and microbiomes across mammals (Fig. 1c) [34, 35]. Transitions to herbivory seem to have especially large effects on the microbiome. Mammals with independently evolved herbivorous diets host similar microbiota. Additionally, some of the same genes and pathways that differ in abundance between herbivorous and carnivorous microbiomes also rapidly shift in corresponding directions in humans who change from vegetarian to omnivorous diets [26]. Interestingly, insectivory has also been associated with some degree of convergence in mammalian microbiomes [46].

Major dietary transitions inevitably correlate with numerous other physiological changes, both related to and independent of diet itself, simply as a result of phylogenetic non-independence [47]. As a consequence, interpreting these changes as evidence of diet per se structuring the microbiome is likely an oversimplification. Numerous mammals host gut communities contrary to the general pattern of convergence by diet. Panda bears, despite being strict herbivores, host gut microbiomes comparatively similar to their carnivorous and omnivorous confamilials [35] and that differ substantially in functional gene complement and ecological dynamics from other herbivores [48, 49]. Work from our group shows that baleen whales, despite an entirely animal-based diet, host microbiomes that share similarities in both taxonomy and functional gene complement with the foregut-fermenting herbivores, to which they are distantly related [50]. Among bats, which have evolved numerous dietary specializations including nectivory, carnivory, sanguivory, frugivory, and insectivory, surveys revealed conflicting patterns with respect to diet and microbiomes (Fig. 2c) [51, 52]. Within species, dietary effects on the microbiome can be assessed independently of other factors. In comparative analyses, these effects must be understood in context with changes to things like gut morphology. Notably, both whales and pandas retain gut morphological similarities to their closest relatives that mirror the similarities in their microbiomes. Therefore, the relationship between diet, phylogeny, and the microbiome is not always a straightforward one.

The mammalian gut microbiome clearly shows the deep imprint of mammalian evolutionary history, both at the level of community similarity and within individual microbial lineages. What are the consequences of these relationships? When does perturbation result in health consequences, and when are these consequences relevant to evolutionary fitness (Fig. 2)? Can the “microbiome” even be considered a thing that evolves (Box 3, Fig.
3)?

Correlations between shared evolutionary history and impact on mammalian hosts are also beginning to appear in broad comparative surveys across populations and species, although methods to formally examine cophylogenetic patterns in such datasets are still in their infancy. H. pylori, which has long been known to codiversify with human mitochondrial lineages [31], induces variable gastric disease symptom severity in different host genotypes in a manner consistent with either coevolutionary processes or lineage-specific adaptation [58]. In a recent paper seeking to tease apart signals of dietary and phylogenetic correlation in mammalian gut microbiota, many of the most tightly codiversifying microbial lineages also associated with inflammatory bowel disease in human datasets, suggesting that the pattern of codiversification itself may be an especially useful tool for finding microbes relevant to human health [59]. These codiversified lineages make clear candidates for investigating the underlying basis for recent formulations of the “hygiene hypothesis”, which posit that immune stimulation by microbes has a causal relationship with a number of chronic disease states, and that differences in transmission efficiency, coupled with the increased use of antibiotics, are a risk factor in some societies [23, 60].

As we have shown, perturbing species-specific microbiomes results in negative health and fitness consequences. Characterizing the mechanisms that determine these microbiome configurations is thus a key prerequisite to exploiting the microbiome therapeutically. Two broad categories of mechanisms underlie microbiome assembly: transmission and filtering.

Different portions of the microbiome likely follow fundamentally different dynamics, complicating our ability to disentangle the competing effects of transmission and filtering across evolution [97]. Even when the similarity among gut communities precisely mirrors the evolutionary history of their hosts in a pattern of phylosymbiosis, as has been demonstrated for hominid apes [98], some members of the community may be determined via environmental filtering by phylogenetically correlated factors (like gut morphology), while others individually track the host phylogeny itself in a pattern of codiversification [32, 99]. Systematically incorporating phylogenetic information from gut microbes themselves into comparative datasets offers great promise for teasing apart the effects of different host factors on microbiomes [59]. If we can identify general patterns linking evolutionary processes to the roles played by members of the gut microbiome on host health, phylogenetic information may prove to be a useful tool for identifying and manipulating health-relevant microbes.

Humans live in concert with the microbes around and inside our bodies, and have since our divergence from our most recent common ancestors. By interrogating the characteristics of and mechanisms underlying this divergence, we should be able to gain the most comprehensive view of what makes the human microbiome “human”, and which members of it are most relevant to different components of human health and fitness. Although the complexity of the interactions within the microbiome and between microbes and hosts presents a major challenge, a more concerted and predictive theoretical framework is imperative to progress [100]. Specifically, applying phylogenetic and population genetic approaches to query the targets and effects of natural selection in the microbiome will allow us to explicitly model the assembly and function of this inner microbial ecosystem in ways that allow us to move from the descriptive to the prescriptive. We are now poised to address several outstanding questions about the evolution of the human gut microbiome and use this information in medical research.

As we move forward, bringing these tools and this knowledge into medical microbiome research—taking an evolutionary medicine approach—can illuminate mechanisms underlying dysbiosis and allow us to harness the potential of the microbiome to improve human health.



How can we know what our microbiomes looked like in the past? Were the microbiomes of our ancestors more diverse than our own, as predicted by the disappearing microbiome hypothesis [23]?

Recently, sequencing of Neanderthal dental calculus samples from two caves revealed oral microbiomes that differed according to inferred meat eating behavior at each site. The microbiota of putatively meat-eating specimens closely resemble hunter-gatherer populations, while non-meat eating specimens resemble forager-gathering chimpanzees [125]. Given the explosion in ancient DNA research, it is likely we will know much more about pre-historic human microbiomes within the next several years.

Microbiomes clearly impact host performance, and have changed along the branches of the animal evolutionary tree. Individual microbes, and their hosts, are clearly subject to evolutionary forces. But can a gut microbiome itself really be said to evolve?

Focusing on roles rather than players may also help in constructing alternative models to understand the fitness consequences of microbial associates that do show some degree of conservation through time—including the species-specific (or even codiversifying) microbes described from some mammalian guts. While the above model primarily interprets evolution in the microbiome in the context of host- (or holobiont-) level adaptation, real fitness consequences could also arise purely via random fixation of nearly neutral mutations in hosts and sets of species-specific microbes (Fig. 3). Rather than performing some particular metabolic function, the “role” performed by these microbes might be something like serving as a developmental cue—but would still result in fitness defects if absent.
