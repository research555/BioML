Gut microbiota-derived propionate mediates the neuroprotective effect of osteocalcin in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no absolute cure. The evidence of the involvement of gut microbiota in PD pathogenesis suggests the need to identify certain molecule(s) derived from the gut microbiota, which has the potential to manage PD. Osteocalcin (OCN), an osteoblast-secreted protein, has been shown to modulate brain function. Thus, it is of interest to investigate whether OCN could exert protective effect on PD and, if yes, whether the underlying mechanism lies in the subsequent changes in gut microbiota.

The intraperitoneal injection of OCN can effectively ameliorate the motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in a 6-hydroxydopamine-induced PD mouse model. The further antibiotics treatment and fecal microbiota transplantation experiments confirmed that the gut microbiota was required for OCN-induced protection in PD mice. OCN elevated Bacteroidetes and depleted Firmicutes phyla in the gut microbiota of PD mice with elevated potential of microbial propionate production and was confirmed by fecal propionate levels. Two months of orally administered propionate successfully rescued motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD mice. Furthermore, AR420626, the agonist of FFAR3, which is the receptor of propionate, mimicked the neuroprotective effects of propionate and the ablation of enteric neurons blocked the prevention of dopaminergic neuronal loss by propionate in PD mice.

Together, our results demonstrate that OCN ameliorates motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD mice, modulating gut microbiome and increasing propionate level might be an underlying mechanism responsible for the neuroprotective effects of OCN on PD, and the FFAR3, expressed in enteric nervous system, might be the main action site of propionate.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and is clinically dominated by motor symptoms, including rigidity, resting tremor, and bradykinesia [1, 2] that result from the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), which is the cardinal pathological feature of PD [3]. Clinically, these motor symptoms respond well to dopaminergic replacement therapy [4]. However, this kind of treatment cannot reverse the progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD [5].

Additionally, in the process of bone remodeling, the gut microbiota was shown to regulate the activity of osteoblast and osteoclast [27–29]. And a recent finding that the serum level of OCN is associated with the Chao index of gut microbiota species in patients with Crohn’s disease [30] further suggests the potential for OCN to impact microbiota composition. It is thus logical to ask whether there is a link among OCN, the gut microbiota, and PD. Therefore, we hypothesized that OCN can prevent motor impairments and dopaminergic neuronal loss by modulating the gut microbiota in PD mice.

We first examined the effects of the intraperitoneal injection of OCN in a PD mouse model induced by the intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). 6-OHDA is a hydroxylated analog of the natural dopamine neurotransmitter and used to destroy nigral dopaminergic neurons and deplete the striatum of DA neurotransmitter after the injection into the striatum, thus reproducing the pathological features responsible for motor impairments in PD [31]. Behavioral tests showed significant decreases in movement distance (6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0061) and rearing frequency (6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0042) in the open field test, a defect in frequency of left limb touches in the cylinder test (6-OHDA vs control: p < 0.0001), and a decrease in latency in the rotarod test (6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0006) in 6-OHDA-induced PD mice compared with the control group (Fig. 1b, Supplemental Table S1). The administration of 4 μg/kg OCN for 8 weeks significantly improved the motor impairments in the open field test (movement distance, p = 0.0343) and cylinder test (the frequency of left limb touches, p = 0.0122) in PD mice (Fig. 1b, Supplemental Table S1), but not in control mice (Supplemental Fig. 1A). However, no significant improvements were induced by the administration of 40 μg/kg OCN in 6-OHDA-induced PD mice, suggesting that the dose of OCN is critical for its protective effect in PD (Fig. 1b, Supplemental Table S1).

Given that dopaminergic neuronal loss in the nigrostriatal system is the main pathological characteristics of PD, we examined whether OCN also exerts a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons in the SN and striatum. There was a nearly 70% reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine and was used as a marker of the dopaminergic neurons) immunostaining, which was used to identify dopaminergic neurons in the SN, on the 6-OHDA-injected side of PD mouse brains (6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0003) compared with control mouse brains, whereas OCN treatment significantly prevented the reduction in dopaminergic neurons in PD mice (6-OHDA vs 6-OHDA+ 4 μg/kg OCN: p = 0.0175) (Fig. 1c). Consistent with this observation, immunostaining and western blotting in the striatum also showed remarkable decreases in the TH-positive fibers (6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0003) and TH protein levels (6-OHDA vs control: p < 0.0001) on the injected side of striatum of PD mouse brains compared with control mouse brains that were restored after OCN treatment (6-OHDA vs 6-OHDA+ 4 μg/kg OCN: TH-positive fibers, p = 0.0471; TH protein levels, p = 0.0477) (Fig. 1d). However, there was no significant increase in the number of dopaminergic neurons in the SN and striatum of PD mice after 40 μg/kg OCN administration (Fig. 1c, d). And no changes in the dopaminergic neurons in the SN and striatum of control mice were observed after the intervention of 4 μg/kg OCN (Supplemental Fig. 1B, C). Therefore, this evidence demonstrates that the administration of OCN at a dosage of 4 μg/kg can prevent motor impairments and dopaminergic neuronal loss in 6-OHDA-induced PD mice.

To test whether the neuroprotective effect of OCN in PD depends on the gut microbiota, we depleted the gut microbiota by using an antibiotic cocktail 4 weeks before OCN administration (Fig. 2a, Supplemental Fig. 2). Gut microbiota-depletion blocked the OCN-induced improvements in motor function, including movement distance (Abx-6-OHDA vs Abx-6-OHDA+OCN: p = 0.8932) and number of rearing (Abx-6-OHDA vs Abx-6-OHDA+OCN: p = 0.8842) in the open field test, frequency of left limb touches in the cylinder test (Abx-6-OHDA vs Abx-6-OHDA+OCN: p = 0.9568), and latency in the rotarod test (Abx-6-OHDA vs Abx-6-OHDA+OCN: p = 0.3015) in 6-OHDA-induced PD mice (Fig. 2b, Supplemental Table S2). Notably, gut microbiota depletion significantly increased the motor performance in the open field test (distance: control vs Abx-control: 0.0018, 6-OHDA vs Abx-6-OHDA: p = 0.0092; number of rearing: control vs Abx-control: 0.0009, 6-OHDA vs Abx-6-OHDA: 0.0481) (Fig. 2b, Supplemental Table S2).

To further support the notion that gut microbiota alteration mediate the neuroprotective effects of OCN on PD, we transplanted fecal microbiota from control group, 6-OHDA group, and 6-OHDA+OCN group into gut microbiota-depleted mice (which underwent 5 weeks of antibiotic pretreatment). Two weeks after fecal transplantation, we compared the motor function of the different groups of mice (Fig. 3a). In the FMT6-OHDA group, total descent time in the pole test (FMTcontrol vs FMT6-OHDA: p = 0.0336; FMT6-OHDA vs FMT6-OHDA + OCN: p = 0.0006) was elongated and latency in the rotarod test (FMTcontrol vs FMT6-OHDA: p = 0.0288; FMT6-OHDA vs FMT6-OHDA + OCN: p = 0.0013) was significantly shortened compared to the FMTcontrol and FMT6-OHDA + OCN group (Fig. 3b, Supplemental Table S3). Movement distance and the number of rearings in the open field test were not affected in either FMT6-OHDA or FMT6-OHDA + OCN treated mice (Fig. 3b, Supplemental Table S3). The improved motor performance of mice harboring microbiota from the 6-OHDA+OCN donors compared to the 6-OHDA donors suggests that the gut microbiota might contribute to the benefits conferred by OCN on motor dysfunction in PD mice (Fig. 3b, Supplemental Table S3). Thus, both antibiotic treatment and fecal microbiota transplantation experiments suggest that the gut microbiota is required for the protective effect of OCN in PD.

We next investigated how OCN affected the gut microbiota composition. We performed 16S rRNA sequencing to assess the composition of the gut microbiota. Simpson and Shannon indexes showed no significant differences between groups (Supplemental Fig. 3), suggesting that the diversities of mice gut microbiota were not impacted by 6-OHDA or 4 μg/kg OCN treatment, whereas the UniFrac principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed that the gut microbial composition of 6-OHDA-induced PD mice was significantly distinct from that of the control group and that OCN treatment seemed to restore the microbial community structure of PD mice backwards to that of the control group (unweighted ANOSIM: R = 0.6063, p = 0.001, Fig. 4a). In total, about average 646 OTUs per sample were mapped in phylum level and the mean annotation ratio of family level was 75.39%, while that of genus level was 15.53% (Supplemental Table S4). Thus, we compared the taxonomic alterations mainly in the levels of or above family between groups. Shown in both heatmap and Venn diagram (Fig. 4b, c), we found that six taxa significantly changed in 6-OHDA group vs control group. Specifically, compared with the control group, 6-OHDA-induced PD mice showed a significant decrease in the relative abundances (RAs) of Bacteroidetes (6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0176) at the phylum level, S24-7 (6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0346), Rikenellaceae (6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0025), and Erysipelotrichaceae (6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0160) at the family level and a significant increase in the RAs of Firmicutes (6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0162) at the phylum level, Lachnospiraceae (6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0022), and unclassified Clostridiales (6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0455) at the family level. However, OCN administration significantly reversed the changes in PD mice (6-OHDA vs 6-OHDA+OCN: Bacteroidetes, p = 0.0007 at the phylum level, S24-7, p = 0.0016; Rikenellaceae, p < 0.0001 at the family level; Firmicutes, p = 0.0018 at the phylum level, Lachnospiraceae, p = 0.0062, unclassified Clostridiales, p = 0.0083 at the family) (Fig. 4d, Supplemental Table S5). Similar changes were also observed at the genus level (Supplemental Table S5). However, the above alterations in gut microbiota induced by 4 μg/kg OCN treatment was not observed in the control mice (Supplemental Fig. 1D). Together, these data demonstrated the gut microbial features of OCN treatment in PD mice.

The Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUST) was employed to predict the abundance of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthology (KO) from the 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. Compared with that of the control group, the gut microbiome of 6-OHDA-induced PD mice exhibited a significantly decreased potential to produce propionate, as evidenced by the decreased RA of K01847 (methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, Mut; 6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0325) (Fig. 5a, Supplemental Table S6). In addition, the RAs of KOs related to butyrate production were altered, but not in the same direction; K00634 (phosphate butyryltransferase, ptb; 6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0228) and K00929 (butyrate kinase, buk; 6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0277) were significantly decreased and K00074 (3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, Hbd; 6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0348) was increased, while K01034 and K01035 (the key KOs of rate-limiting enzyme of butyrate production) showed no difference, indicating the unchanged potential in butyrate production (Fig. 5a, Supplemental Table S6). And the RAs of main KOs related to acetate production showed no difference between control and 6-OHDA group (Fig. 5a, Supplemental Table S6). Notably, OCN administration successfully reversed these changes in PD mice (6-OHDA vs 6-OHDA+OCN: K01847, p = 0.0008; K00634, p = 0.0002; K00929, p = 0.0002; K00074, p = 0.0006) (Fig. 5a, Supplemental Table S6). However, these KOs of the control mice was not affected by OCN administration (Supplemental Fig. 1E). Therefore, the intervention with OCN can alter the microbiota taxonomy and might increase the bacterial potential of producing propionate in PD mice.

The abovementioned results of functional analysis were predictive; to further study whether bacterial SCFAs altered, we assayed the fecal SCFA content by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The results revealed a significant decrease in fecal propionate in 6-OHDA-induced PD mice compared with the control group (6-OHDA vs control: p = 0.0003), and OCN treatment significantly reversed this change in PD mice (6-OHDA vs 6-OHDA+OCN: p = 0.03) (Fig. 5b). There was no significant difference in the fecal levels of acetate and butyrate among the three groups (Fig. 5b). And the fecal level of these three SCFAs in control mice was not affected by OCN administration (Supplemental Fig. 1F). Furthermore, the correlation analysis showed that the fecal propionate level but not the other two SCFAs was positively correlated with the RAs of PD depleted taxa, S24-7 (r = 0.4961, p = 0.0010) and Rikenellaceae (r = 0.5063, p = 0.0098) and negatively correlated with the RAs of PD enriched Lachnosipraceae (r = -0.5843, p = 0.0017) and unclassified Clostridiales (r = -0.5426, p = 0.0042) (Fig. 5c), suggesting these microbial changes could be related with the alterations in fecal propionate levels. More importantly, the fecal propionate level was positively correlated with parameters of motor function in the open field test (movement distance: r = 0.4973, p = 0.0240), cylinder test (frequency of left forelimb touches: r = 0.5786, p = 0.0038), and rotarod test (latency: r = 0.6199, p = 0.0021) (Fig. 5d). Thus, the gut microbial mediated neuroprotective effect of OCN might be correlated with its effect on regulating the potential of microbial propionate production which was depleted in gut microbiota of 6-OHDA-induced PD mice.

To further test the causal relation of propionate with motor function improvements in PD mice, we administered sodium propionate in drinking water to 6-OHDA-induced PD mice for 8 weeks. The intervention with propionate resulted in an obvious increase in fecal propionate levels but not serum propionate levels in 6-OHDA-induced PD mice compared with the control group (Fig. 6a). Importantly, the oral administration of propionate effectively improved motor function in both the open field test (movement distance: 6-OHDA vs 6-OHDA+propionate: p = 0.0208; number of rearing: 6-OHDA vs 6-OHDA+propionate: p = 0.0339) and cylinder test (6-OHDA vs 6-OHDA+propionate: p = 0.0012), but not the rotarod test in 6-OHDA-induced PD mice (Fig. 6b, Supplemental Table S7).

Since FFAR3 has been reported as the predominant receptor type mediating the protective effect of propionate [18], we next administered FFAR3 agonist (AR420626, 0.1 mg/kg) to 6-OHDA-induced PD mice once daily for 8 weeks by gavage (Fig. 7a). As with the effects of propionate in PD mice, the intervention with AR420626 effectively improved number of rearing in the open field test, but not movement distance, significantly improved motor function in the pole test and rotarod test, but not the cylinder test in 6-OHDA-induced PD mice (Fig. 7b, Supplemental Table S8). In parallel, the intragastric administration of AR420626 prevented 20% of the dopaminergic neuronal loss in the 6-OHDA-injected side of the PD mouse brains (Fig. 7c) and recovered the TH protein levels in the striatum (Fig. 7d). Hence, the agonist of FFAR3, AR420626, mimicked the neuroprotective effects of propionate. And we assumed that gut microbiota-derived propionate might work in part as a FFAR3 agonist to mediate OCN’s protective signal to neuronal system for preventing PD development.

Since FFAR3 activation improved motor defects in PD mice, we next asked in which compartment FFAR3 responding to the altered propionate levels dominantly contributed to its neuroprotective effects. Thus, we measured the expression of FFAR3 in different tissues. We found that the relative expression of FFAR3 in the jejunum, ileum, and colon were far higher than that in the neural organs, like the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum (Fig. 8a). Since propionate has been reported to exert its effects by stimulating the release of Glp-1 from enteroendocrine L cells [32] or activating the enteric nervous system (ENS) to transmit its signal to the brain [33], we first measured the serum level of Glp-1 on the basis of the neuroprotective effects of Glp-1 on PD [34–36]. However, no significant difference was observed either between PD and control mice or between propionate treated and untreated PD mice (Fig. 8b). Then, to test whether propionate could act on ENS, we treated 6-OHDA-induced PD mice with cisplatin, a known enteric neurotoxin [37], to deplete PGP9.5-positive enteric cells at the dosage of 3 mg/kg for 4 weeks before the administration of propionate (control vs cisplatin: p = 0.0278, Supplemental Fig. 4). In these enteric cells-depleted mice, we found that the effect of propionate to protect dopaminergic neuronal loss was no longer significant (Fig. 8c, d). Thus, we assumed that propionate could work as a FFAR3 agonist targeting ENS to exert the neuroprotective effect in 6-OHDA-induced PD mice.

The finding in our study demonstrated that OCN increased the microbial propionate production, which might activate FFAR3 in enteric neurons, to exert its protective effect on PD. Using a mouse model of 6-OHDA-induced PD, the current study demonstrated that OCN can prevent motor impairments and dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD mice. Our data further suggested that OCN can exert protective effect via regulating microbial metabolism of SCFAs and increasing gut microbiota-derived propionate levels in PD mice. Furthermore, the oral administration of propionate showed protective effect against PD, suggested that microbial propionate production was a potential target for PD intervention. And our data suggested that propionate mainly acted on FFAR3 in enteric neurons to exert its neuroprotective effects on PD.

There are some limitations in our study. First, our study mainly showed the protective effect rather than the therapeutic effect of OCN in PD mice. To further explore the therapeutic effect of OCN administered several weeks after the successful construction of PD model is our research interest in the future. Second, the protective effect of OCN and propionate was not tested in other PD models, like MPTP-induced PD model and rotenone-induced PD model. More in-depth studies and clinical investigations are needed to test and verify our findings.

In conclusion, the current study indicated that OCN could ameliorate motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD mice, modulating gut microbiome and increasing propionate level could constitute an underlying mechanism responsible for the neuroprotective effects of OCN in PD, and that FFAR3 in the ENS might mediate the neuroprotective effect of propionate in PD.

The antibodies used in this study were as follows: TH (Sigma Aldrich, AB152) and GAPDH (KeyGEN, KGAA002). The reagents used for western blot were all obtained from Sigma Aldrich. The remaining reagents used in the animal study included osteocalcin (Bachem, H-6552), sodium propionate (Sigma Aldrich, P1880), sodium chloride (Sigma Aldrich, S3014), 6-OHDA (Sigma Aldrich, H116), desipramine (Sigma Aldrich, D3900), ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin hydrochloride were all purchased from Sangon Biotech. The BCA kit was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (23259), the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit was purchased from QIAGEN (51504), and the GLP-1 ELISA kit was from Millipore (EGLP-35 K). And the ABC kit and DAB kit were purchased from Vectastain Elite.

All mouse experiments in this study were approved by the ethics committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). The experiments were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publications No. 8023, revised 1978). Male C57BL/6 J mice (23–25 g) were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China). The mice were housed in a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) environment under controlled conditions, a 12-h light/dark cycle, a temperature of 20–22 °C, and 45 ± 5% humidity, with free access to food and water. All mice were acclimated for one week before the experiment.

At the end of these experiments, all mice underwent behavioral tests and were then euthanized. Blood samples were collected and then kept at room temperature for 1 h to ensure complete clotting before centrifugation at 4 °C and 5000 rpm for 10 min to obtain serum samples. Tissues were carefully collected in liquid nitrogen and then stored at − 80 °C until analysis.

Behavioral tests for all animals were performed in the light phase. The open field test was performed to evaluate the motor activity of the mice. The mice were placed in the center of the open field test chamber (a white 27.5 × 27.5 cm chamber with an open top) and allowed to explore freely for 5 min. All activities were recorded by a video camera and tracked using the ANY-maze automated video system. The movement distance and number of rearing were analyzed to evaluate motor function.

The pole test was used in the FMT experiment instead of cylinder test as there were no unilateral lesions-induced in this experiment. A 0.5-m long, 1-cm-diameter pole that had a 2-cm-diameter spherical protuberance on top and was wrapped with non-adhesive gauze to facilitate gripping was placed in the home cage. Timing began when the experimenter released the mouse and ended when one hind limb reached the home cage base. The total time required to climb down the pole was measured. Each mouse performed 3 successive trials. The average of the three trials was calculated for statistical analyses.

Mouse brain tissues were lysed in RIPA buffer with 1× protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail to extract total protein. The total protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by a BCA Kit. After the supernatant was denatured by boiling for 5 min in loading buffer, equal amounts of proteins were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in 0.1% TBST for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with a primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the blots were developed with an ECL reagent. The following primary antibodies were used: the antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, 1:10000) and anti-GAPDH (1:20000). The densitometry analysis of the band of TH protein was analyzed using ImageJ 1.49v (National Institutes of Health, USA, https://imagej.en.softonic.com/).

After behavioral tests, 3-5 mice per group were anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium (0.8 ml/kg), perfused transcardially with PBS buffer, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixative solution. The brains and ileum were dissected, fixed, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at a thickness of 4 μm. Every fifth section containing the SN or striatum was collected, and 3 sections per sample were subjected to immunostaining. Briefly, after blocking endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H2O2 and antigen retrieval with citric acid buffer, the sections were blocked with 5% goat serum and incubated with a primary antibody against TH (1:400) for brains and PGP9.5 (1:2000) for ileum overnight at 4 °C. On the second day, the sections were incubated with a biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody, and staining was performed using the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) system and nickel-enhanced diaminobenzidine (DAB) incubation. Images were obtained using a microscope (Olympus IX70, Japan). The number of TH-positive neurons in the SN and PGP9.5-positive enteric neurons and the fractions of the TH-positive area in the striatum were measured using ImageJ. The data are expressed as a percentage of the number of TH-positive neurons or area fraction on the impaired side relative to that on the intact side.

To collect fecal pellets, mice were placed individually in empty autoclaved cages and allowed to defecate freely from 7 am to 10 am 3 days before the behavioral tests. Once feces were formed, they were collected immediately in individual sterile tubes at − 20 °C and then stored at − 80 °C.

0.2 g fresh fecal samples were collected in pre-weighted tubes containing 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Samples were thoroughly vortexed and diluted with PBS to 1:10000; samples from antibiotic-treated mice were collected 4 and 5 weeks after antibiotic initiation. Equal concentrations of stool diluent from antibiotic, control, and blanks were placed on LB agar plates and incubated for 24 h.

Microbial genomic DNA was extracted from fecal samples by a QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. To ensure successful DNA isolation, the quantity of the DNA was measured using a NanoDrop instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), the quality of the DNA was then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the sterile water was used as the negative control.

Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) based on OTUs was employed to predict the abundances of functional categories using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologs (KO). The relative abundance of the KO associated with the metabolism of SCFAs was further analyzed by one-way ANOVA.

Fecal SCFA concentrations were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Briefly, 0.1 g of feces were homogenized with 0.4 ml ddH2O and centrifuged at 4 °C and 5000 rpm for 5 min. Aliquots (0.2 ml) of the supernatants were collected, and then 0.05 ml of 50% H2SO4 and 0.25 ml of diethyl ether containing 50 μg/ml 2-methylpentanoic acid were added. After vortexing for 2 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C and 12000 rpm for another 10 min. After incubation at − 20 °C for 30 min, the supernatants were collected in a vial containing anhydrous sodium sulfate and then measured by GC on an Agilent7890B-7000D system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) equipped with flame ionization, thermal conductivity detectors, capillary columns, and GC ChemStation software. Acetate, propionate, and butyrate were quantified using pure standards diluted in diethyl ether.

The serum level of glucagon-like peptide (Glp-1) was measured by an ELISA kit (Millipore EGLP-35k) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Before the collection of blood samples, 10 μl of DPP-IV inhibitor was added to the tubes to inhibit the degradation of Glp-1.

Except for the 16S rRNA data has been described in detail. Data obtained in this study were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6 software (https://www.graphpad.com/) by one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc comparisons using Tukey’s test for multiple group comparisons. Spearman correlation analyses were used for 16S rRNA data, and the correlation between fecal propionate level and motor function were analyzed by Pearson correlation analyses. The data are presented as the mean ± SEM, and p < 0.05 was set as the threshold for significance.
