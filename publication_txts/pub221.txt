Impact of Early Life Antibiotic Exposure and Neonatal Hyperoxia on the Murine Microbiome and Lung Injury

Cross talk between the intestinal microbiome and the lung and its role in lung health remains unknown. Perinatal exposure to antibiotics disrupts the neonatal microbiome and may have an impact on the preterm lung. We hypothesized that perinatal antibiotic exposure leads to long-term intestinal dysbiosis and increased alveolar simplification in a murine hyperoxia model. Pregnant C57BL/6 wild type dams and neonatal mice were treated with antibiotics before and/or immediately after delivery. Control mice received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Neonatal mice were exposed to 95% oxygen for 4 days or room air. Microbiome analysis was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Pulmonary alveolarization and vascularization were analyzed at postnatal day (PND) 21. Perinatal antibiotic exposure modified intestinal beta diversity but not alpha diversity in neonatal mice. Neonatal hyperoxia exposure altered intestinal beta diversity and relative abundance of commensal bacteria in antibiotic treated mice. Hyperoxia disrupted pulmonary alveolarization and vascularization at PND 21; however, there were no differences in the degree of lung injury in antibiotic treated mice compared to vehicle treated controls. Our study suggests that exposure to both hyperoxia and antibiotics early in life may cause long-term alterations in the intestinal microbiome, but intestinal dysbiosis may not significantly influence neonatal hyperoxic lung injury.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that remains one of the most common long-term complications of preterm birth. It results from a complex, multifactorial process that disrupts alveolar growth and pulmonary vascular development in the preterm infant lung1. Factors influencing this disruption include prematurity, hyperoxia, inflammation, prenatal and postnatal infections, mechanical ventilation, and growth restriction, amongst others. Although advances in care of the extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infant have improved survival rates, BPD incidence has plateaued. Antenatal steroids, non-invasive ventilation, volume -targeted ventilation, and surfactant administration have all greatly impacted the survival of the ELBW infant, however, there remains a need for additional novel strategies or therapies to prevent and treat BPD2,3.

The cross talk between intestinal commensal organisms and the pulmonary system (the gut-lung axis) and its role in lung health and disease is actively being investigated. It is thought that intestinal dysbiosis may produce adverse pulmonary effects due to its potential to cause increased inflammation and impaired innate immunity15. Microbial dysbiosis has also been shown to play a role in chronic lung disorders such as asthma and cystic fibrosis16. The role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of BPD and the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully investigated. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of intestinal microbiome alterations on lung injury and repair after hyperoxia exposure in a murine model. We hypothesize that perinatal antibiotic-mediated intestinal dysbiosis increases BPD-like phenotype in a murine hyperoxia model.

We maintained active colonies of C57BL/6 wild type mice by breeding them in the animal facility at Texas Children’s Hospital’s Feigin Center. Time pregnant mice raised in our animal facility were used for the initial experiments (Ampicillin only) and timed pregnant mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories were used for the subsequent hyperoxia experiments. This study protocol and all animal experiments were approved by the Baylor College of Medicine IACUC and all experiments were performed in accordance with the IACUC guidelines and regulations.

Mouse pups were allocated to either of two oxygen treatment groups, one group exposed to normoxia (room air at 21% O2) and the other group exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2), PND 4–8. Pups were returned to room air after hyperoxia exposure. We chose this timeframe for hyperoxia exposure since animals at this age are in the early alveolar stage of lung development. This model, which has previously been described, produces a distinct phenotype of arrest of pulmonary alveolarization and vascularization after hyperoxia exposure17. Plexiglas chambers (55 × 40 × 50 cm) were used to conduct hyperoxia experiments, and oxygen was delivered into the chambers through an oxygen blender to achieve a continuous level of 95% O2. Animals were examined every 12 hours for evidence of morbidity or mortality. Soda lime was placed in the chambers in order to remove excess CO2. Dams were rotated between room air and hyperoxia exposed litters every 24 hours to prevent oxygen toxicity in the dams. Dams exposed to antibiotics were only switched with other antibiotic exposed dams. Neonatal mice were euthanized on PND 8 (for microbiome analysis) and PND 21 after recovery in room air (for lung morphometry and microbiome analysis). The control group was kept in room air for the same duration of time (until PND 8 or PND 21).

Pregnant dams were treated with ampicillin (100 mg/kg) via oral gavage prior to delivery from E18–20 to simulate prenatal antibiotic exposure. Pups were then treated with ampicillin (100 mg/kg) or PBS via intraperitoneal injection (i.p) for 3 days (PND 1–3). Control dams and control neonatal pups were treated with either PBS via oral gavage or PBS i.p. injections, respectively. Ampicillin is one of the most commonly used antibiotics for the empiric treatment of early onset sepsis in preterm neonates. Hence, we wanted to evaluate the effect of this antibiotic on the developing neonatal microbiome. In the second set of experiments with hyperoxia and room air, pregnant dams were treated with an antibiotic cocktail (ampicillin 5 mg/ml, gentamicin 0.2 mg/ml, vancomycin 0.8 mg/ml) combined and given at 0.2 ml per dose by gavage once a day from E16 - PND3 for a total of 7 days. Control dams received PBS via oral gavage at the same dose of 0.2 ml. In our second set of experiments, neonatal pups were not given antibiotics directly. The second set of experiments used an antibiotic cocktail to evaluate the effects of broad-spectrum maternal antibiotics on the neonatal microbiome as has been published in previous studies18,19.

Hyperoxia and room air exposed animals were anesthetized at PND 21 with 100 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital i.p., tracheas were cannulated, and lungs were inflation fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) by endotracheal administration at 25 cm H2O pressure for 15 minutes. Next, the trachea was tied off and lungs removed and fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4 °C followed by dehydration in graded alcohol and embedded in paraffin. Lung tissue sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and appropriate antibodies for immunohistochemistry. Alveolar development was assessed by the measurement of mean linear intercept (MLI) and radial alveolar counts (RAC) as previously described17.

To determine pulmonary vessel density, lung sections were stained for Von Willebrand Factor (vWF) (1:4000 dilution, abcam), an endothelial specific marker, using immunofluorescence techniques. Vessels were counted if the external diameter was less than 100 μm per high-power field. In the stained lung tissue section for each animal, we analyzed 15 random non-overlapping fields for microvessel number using the 40x microscope objective. The fields containing large airways or vessels were avoided.

Intestinal contents were obtained from neonatal mice as previously described, and both lung and intestinal contents were sent to the Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research at Baylor College of Medicine for 16S rRNA gene sequencing20. Methods were adapted from the NIH-Human Microbiome Project and the Earth Microbiome Project21. Bacterial DNA was extracted using the PowerMag Microbiome DNA isolation kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) using the 2 × 250 bp paired-end read protocol. The read pairs were demultiplexed and reads were merged using USEARCH v7.0.1090. Merging allowed zero mismatches and a minimum overlap of 50 bases, and merged reads were trimmed at the first base with a q ≤ 5. A quality filter was applied to the resulting merged reads and those containing above 0.5% expected errors were discarded. Sequences were stepwise clustered into OTUs at a similarity cut-off value of 97% using the UPARSE algorithm. Chimeras were removed using USEARCH v7.0.1090 and UCHIME v4.2. OTUs were mapped to a version of the SILVA Database containing only the 16S V4 region using USEARCH v7.0.1090.

For morphometry analysis, GraphPad version 8 was used for the analysis of our data. Based on previous hyperoxia induced lung injury studies in our lab, it was estimated that 5 animals per group would provide 80% power at a significance level of 0.05 to detect a 25 μ increase (2 SD) in the MLI among hyperoxia exposed and room air controls. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA to test for the independent effects of antibiotics and hyperoxia and to look for any interaction. Subsequent pairwise comparisons were completed using Tukey’s multiple-comparison testing to analyze the differences in treatments of hyperoxia and antibiotics in the control vs experimental groups. Significance was accepted as p < 0.05.

For the microbiome analysis, statistical significance for analysis of alpha diversity and taxonomic relative abundance between two groups used the Kruskal–Wallis test22. Differences in beta diversity (weighted Unifrac distance) were assessed using PERMANOVA. When comparing more than one measure, such as multiple measures of alpha diversity or for multiple taxonomic genera, P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the false discovery rate (FDR) algorithm23.

Intestinal beta diversity was significantly different between ampicillin treated mice and controls at PND 6 (p = 0.039) and at PND 21 (p = 0.041) (Fig. 1A). However, Ampicillin did not alter lung beta diversity at either PND 6 (p = 0.42) or PND 21 (p = 0.057) (Fig. 1B). Ampicillin treated neonatal mice did not show significant differences in alpha diversity (Shannon Diversity or Observed OTUs) in the intestine or lung when compared to PBS treated controls at PND 6 or PND 21 (Supplemental Fig. 1). At PND 21, intestinal relative abundance of the genera Bacteroides and Akkermansia were significantly decreased in ampicillin treated mice when compared to controls (P < 0.05; Fig. 2A). However, we did not find any significant changes in relative abundance of commensal bacteria in the lung between ampicillin treated mice and controls (Fig. 2B).

At PND 8, no differences were observed in beta diversity in either room air (p = 0.51) (Fig. 3A) or hyperoxia exposed neonatal mice (p = 0.099) (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, there were significant differences in beta diversity at PND 21 with separation between antibiotic treated mice and controls in both the room air (p = 0.001) (Fig. 3C) and hyperoxia exposed groups (p = 0.047) (Fig. 3D). However, antibiotic treated neonatal mice did not show differences in alpha diversity measures using either Observed OTUs or Shannon Diversity when compared to PBS treated controls at either timepoint (Supplemental Fig. 2).

There were no differences in relative abundance in commensal bacteria in the intestine seen at PND 8 between antibiotic exposed mice and controls in either room air or hyperoxia groups (Fig. 4A,B). However, at PND 21, in the room air group, there was a decrease in the relative abundance of genera Bacteroidales, Romboutsia, Alistipes and Parasutterella and an increase in Akkermansia in the three antibiotic exposed mice when compared to controls (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4C). There were no significant differences seen in the relative abundance of intestinal commensal bacteria in the hyperoxia group at PND 21 between antibiotic exposed mice and controls (Fig. 4D).

Next, we wanted to elucidate if within the antibiotic exposed mice, hyperoxia had an early or delayed effect on the gut microbiome. We did not find any differences in beta diversity (p = 0.5) or relative abundance (p > 0.05) at PND 8 between the hyperoxia and room air groups among mice exposed to antibiotics (Fig. 5A,C). At PND 21, antibiotic exposed mice subjected to hyperoxia developed a distinctly different microbiome than those exposed to room air (p = 0.001) (Fig. 5B). There were significant increases in the relative abundance of Bacteroidales and Alistipes at PND 21 in the hyperoxia exposed mice compared to room air controls, however, there was a decrease in the relative abundance of Akkermansia (Fig. 5D). In the PBS treated controls, we did not observe any significant alterations in beta diversity or microbial composition between room air and hyperoxia exposed mice.

As described in the methods section, neonatal mice were exposed to room air or 95% oxygen for 4 days (PND 4–8) and then allowed to recover in room air until PND 21. Pulmonary alveolarization was determined using mean linear intercept (MLI) and radial alveolar count (RAC). Hyperoxia significantly reduces pulmonary alveolarization (p < 0.0001) which can be visualized in the representative lung fields at 20x (Fig. 6B,D) when compared to the room air controls (Fig. 6A,C). There was a significant increase in the MLI in hyperoxia + antibiotics exposed mice compared to room air + antibiotics (p < 0.0001). This was also seen in hyperoxia + PBS exposed mice when compared to room air + PBS exposed (p = 0.01). The MLI was not significantly different when comparing hyperoxia exposed mice with three antibiotic exposure to those without antibiotic exposure (p = 0.11) (Fig. 6E). RAC was significantly decreased in hyperoxia exposed mice compared to room air, both in antibiotic exposed mice (p = 0.0007) and PBS controls (p = 0.03). There were no significant differences seen in RAC between hyperoxia + antibiotic exposed mice and hyperoxia + PBS exposed mice (p = 0.33) (Fig. 6F).

Hyperoxia also causes an arrest in lung vascular development. To determine degree of angiogenesis, we quantified vessel number using immunohistochemistry for vWF as described in the methods section. Hyperoxia significantly decreased vessel development in the lung in both antibiotic and PBS exposed mice (p < 0.0001) which can be visualized in the representative lung fields at 20x (Fig. 6H,J) when compared to room air controls (Fig. 6G,I). There were no significant differences seen in the degree of decreased lung vascular development between hyperoxia + antibiotic exposed and hyperoxia + PBS exposed mice (p = 0.88) (Fig. 6K).

Although there has been an increase in survival of extremely premature infants over time, the incidence of BPD remains stagnant despite advances in care1. BPD has a multifactorial pathogenesis and identifying different mechanisms that contribute to its development is critical to developing therapeutic strategies that may prevent or ameliorate the severity of this disease. Our study sought to investigate how alterations in the intestinal microbiome could influence lung alveolar and vascular development and repair after oxygen exposure in a murine model of BPD. This is the first known study to suggest that hyperoxia alters the intestinal microbial composition over time when combined with antibiotic exposure. Our study also found that antibiotics cause long term changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiome. There seems to be a delayed effect of perinatal antibiotic exposure on the gut microbiome with a greater difference noted at PND 21 despite recovery in room air conditions. Furthermore, exposure to hyperoxia combined with antibiotic exposure leads to distinct gut microbiome changes compared to antibiotic exposure alone. However, we did not find any alterations in the lung microbiome after antibiotic exposure. This finding suggests that the intestinal microbiome as opposed to the lung microbiome may be most vulnerable to adverse exposures during the neonatal period.

In conclusion, oxygen exposure may alter the intestinal microbiome in combination with other insults such as antibiotic treatment. Maternal pre- and post-natal antibiotic exposure can significantly modify the neonatal murine intestinal microbiome over a prolonged time period. Antibiotics do not appear to alter the neonatal murine lung microbiome and it is more likely that the intestinal microbiome itself influences health and disease in the lung.
