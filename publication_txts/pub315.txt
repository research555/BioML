Nuclear and Mitochondrial Genome, Epigenome and Gut Microbiome: Emerging Molecular Biomarkers for Parkinson’s Disease

Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is currently the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, burdening about 10 million elderly individuals worldwide. The multifactorial nature of PD poses a difficult obstacle for understanding the mechanisms involved in its onset and progression. Currently, diagnosis depends on the appearance of clinical signs, some of which are shared among various neurologic disorders, hindering early diagnosis. There are no effective tools to prevent PD onset, detect the disease in early stages or accurately report the risk of disease progression. Hence, there is an increasing demand for biomarkers that may identify disease onset and progression, as treatment-based medicine may not be the best approach for PD. Over the last few decades, the search for molecular markers to predict susceptibility, aid in accurate diagnosis and evaluate the progress of PD have intensified, but strategies aimed to improve individualized patient care have not yet been established. Conclusions: Genomic variation, regulation by epigenomic mechanisms, as well as the influence of the host gut microbiome seem to have a crucial role in the onset and progress of PD, thus are considered potential biomarkers. As such, the human nuclear and mitochondrial genome, epigenome, and the host gut microbiome might be the key elements to the rise of personalized medicine for PD patients.

As life expectancy rises as a result of technological advances, humanity faces an increased burden of aging diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. Degenerative diseases affecting the nervous system are recognized as major causes of death and disabilities among the elderly population worldwide [1]. However, the molecular mechanisms engaged in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases remain elusive. A complete understanding of the molecular biology of neurodegeneration will benefit the search for biomarkers to be employed in strategies for disease detection and patient management, as seen with the efforts being made towards cancer research [2,3].

Currently, the lack of molecular markers to predict susceptibility, accurate diagnosis, and evaluate the progress of PD continues to hinder the establishment of precision medicine strategies. Moreover, it is essential that we consider the findings of multi-omics approaches, which reveal molecular aspects of PD from multiple perspectives and may lead to the establishment of genetic and epigenetic and other circulating markers, which are less invasive, to be used for accurate diagnosis and clinical management of the disease. Here, we discuss findings concerning the identification and validation of potential genetic, epigenetic and microbial biomarkers to enlighten the state-of-the-art in PD molecular biomarker research.

Since James Parkinson’s first medical description in the 19th century, PD has been defined as a neurodegenerative disorder caused by progressive and irreversible degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta (SNpc) [9,13], although Parkinsonism descriptions can be found in earlier fragments [14,15]. PD is the principal cause of Parkinsonism, which describes a syndrome defined by muscular rigidity, resting tremor and bradykinesia [16]. Regarding the dopaminergic neuron degeneration in SNpc, the main feature that characterizes PD pathology is a progressive reduction in levels of dopamine (60–80%), a neurotransmitter involved in various brain functions, such as learning, memory, mood and sleep regulation [9,17,18].

Currently, there are no effective tools to prevent PD onset, as there is no method of detecting the disease in its early stages or that can accurately inform the risk of disease progression. Consequently, further studies are needed to determine molecular factors that can be used as disease-specific biomarkers in preventive medicine (Figure 1). These can assist in the detection of PD before the onset of motor symptoms or in cases where the symptoms presented by the patient are insufficient for an accurate diagnosis. In addition to allowing an increase in the accuracy in the diagnosis process, these biomarkers could also differentiate PD from other forms of parkinsonism and other neurodegenerative diseases [6]. With this, many studies have explored the role of different genetic and epigenetic alterations, as well as alterations in the gut microbiome that may be involved in PD onset and progress, aiming to identify PD biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.

The characterization of the genetic architecture of PD is essential for understanding the cascade of events that leads to PD onset and to find genetic biomarkers to identify individuals or populations at risk of developing PD and patient prognosis. Hence, over the last few decades, various studies investigated the relationship between monogenic and/or idiopathic PD and gene variants (Table 1). Several genes have been associated with monogenic, sporadic, and both forms of PD. Among these, variants in the SNCA gene, which encodes α-syn, are the main genetic factor associated with PD in both etiologies [25,26]. Under pathological conditions, α-syn cannot fulfill its physiological functions, plaques of α-syn aggregates are formed, which may be toxic [25,27]. In addition, α-syn is an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), an essential enzyme for dopamine production [28,29,30], and it may also interact with dopamine transporters (DAT), affecting the dopaminergic synapse [31]. Moreover, α-syn may undergo exocytosis and be absorbed by nearby astrocytes and microglia, forming more aggregates, which stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines—such as interleukins, Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNF-α), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) [32].

Although it is not completely understood, the genetic aspects of PD have been widely explored, in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomics. Recent studies point to the influence of epigenetic aspects in PD onset, as well as how host–microbiome interactions may influence PD progression. These findings are a valuable source of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets that may not only help us understand the mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration, but also provide improvements in clinical practice and patient management through the comprehension of differences and particularities of each patient and population. As highlighted above, a lot of knowledge was elucidated using brain tissue biomarkers. Currently, though, it is important to convert this knowledge into less invasive biomarkers, as circulating molecules altered in tissue and biofluids, which could be useful in the patient management in precision medicine approaches.

Advances in sequencing technologies allowed the exploration of the role of alterations not related to the DNA sequence, but associated with mechanisms of gene regulation. The main mechanisms involved in this process are DNA methylation, histone modifications and the regulation performed by non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Their modulation is involved in processes such as modulation of cell homeostasis and the onset of human diseases [93]. Among the various mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, the role of ncRNAs has been largely explored in different organs and tissues, including the brain. However, the epigenetic modulation of neurons remains elusive and a controversial issue.

We still do not fully understand how epigenetic modulators are involved in neuron activity, survival and death. Nonetheless, there is evidence that they may be important in healthy conditions and may contribute to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. These mechanisms may be an important source of PD biomarkers and therapeutic targets, since the epigenetic regulators can be modulated in patients to return to a healthy condition [94,95,96]. Below, we discuss some of the main findings regarding the role of ncRNAs in neurons and evidence that shows how these molecules may be involved in neurodegeneration and PD development, focusing mainly on microRNAs (miRNAs), Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and Circular RNAs (circRNAs).

The mechanisms of DNA methylation and histone modifications regulate the accessibility of DNA strands to transcription factors, enhancers and RNA polymerase, thus interfering directly in the transcription process (Figure 2). The involvement of DNA methylation and histone modifications in PD has been recently reported, suggesting a mechanism of genome reprogramming. Young et al., (2019) reported the alteration of DNA methylation profile in patients with PD, mainly located not only in dopaminergic neurons but also in regions such as the Cingulate gyrus and, especially, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, which is one of the first areas affected in early PD stages [97]. Thus, it is possible that the deregulation in DNA methylation patterns may explain the gastrointestinal symptoms related to the pre-diagnostic stages.

Considering these studies, it is possible to infer that, although not fully understood, differential gene expression caused by alterations in chromatin states may be directly associated with the events involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as the α-syn aggregation observed in PD. Moreover, it means that might the comprehensive map of epigenetic alterations in PD might be a good source of disease-specific biomarkers.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 21-nucleotide long molecules, distributed in a wide range of organisms [102,103,104]. They are known for their role in post-translational gene silencing in which they are loaded into Argonaut proteins, forming RNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISC) to mediate the degradation of the target messenger RNA (mRNA). In human cells, most of the canonical miRNAs are transcribed from intronic sequences of coding and non-coding regions, although there are miRNAs encoded from exons [103]. Additionally, many miRNA loci are in close proximity, forming clusters, and miRNAs within the same cluster are usually co-transcribed, although some might be suppressed depending on cellular necessity [103].

Recent studies have investigated the functional roles of miRNAs and other ncRNAs in neurodegeneration, exploring aspects such as the expression profile of miRNAs and potential target genes, thus indicating the biological processes affected by the deregulation of these molecules. One of the main points that remain to be elucidated is the identification of miRNA species that are shared among neurodegenerative disorders and disease-specific features miRNAs.

PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are molecules with up to 31 nucleotides in length that were identified in 2006, whose sequences are, generally, not conserved [138,139,140]. Currently, there are at least 30,000 piRNAs described in the human genome and they are suggested to be the most diverse class of small ncRNAs [141]. PiRNAs bind to proteins of the Argonaut/PIWI subfamily—in humans called Piwi-like (Piwil) proteins, forming regulatory complexes (piRISC) that perform (i) post-transcriptional gene silencing by mediating the deadenylation or endonucleolytic cleavages of the mRNA; and (ii) transcriptional silencing by inducing chromatin remodeling by interacting with proteins involved in this process [142,143,144].

Finally, as mitochondrial dysfunctions are believed to play key roles in PD progression, the discovery of mitochondrial piRNAs in cancer cells [171,172,173] derived from genes involved in the oxidative phosphorylation chain, indicate a more complex regulatory network involving mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and is one more reason we should consider investigating the functional roles of piRNAs in healthy CNS and in disease onset.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are the most studied class of ncRNAs. The term is commonly used to refer to linear RNA molecules with more than 200 nucleotides that may be involved in various processes such as DNA translation—acting as enhancers, protein scaffolds, guides for transcription factors, regulating pre-mRNA splicing and other processes [174,175]. Thus, it is suggested that lncRNAs can be involved in several mechanisms of disease onset, as reported in oncology studies. However, regarding PD, few studies associated the deregulation of lncRNAs with PD progression by regulating miRNA repression in neurons. Taurine Upregulated Gene 1 (TUG1) was associated with PD by regulating the miR-152-3p/PTEN pathway [176]. LncRNA GAS5 acts as a sponge of miR-223-3p, promoting microglial inflammatory response in PD by regulating inflammatory pathways [177].

In murine models of PD, lncRNAs decreased during PD development and were further decreased after the administration of L-DOPA therapy [185], suggesting that this set of lncRNAs were associated with both PD and Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) pathogenesis, the latter is a common complication of the chronic dopamine replacement therapy. Gene Ontology analysis revealed the involvement of lncRNAs in processes such as oxidative stress response, inflammation, neurotransmission and apoptosis [185].

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of long ncRNAs formed by the covalent bonding of their 5′-3′ ends. The lack of free terminations makes them resistant to degradation by exonucleases and, therefore, highly stable [186,187]. The biogenesis of circRNAs occurs in parallel with mRNA transcription in a process called back-splicing, processed with the spliceosome machinery, cis sequences in flanking introns, and some specific regulatory proteins [188,189].

Hanan et al., (2020) [199] stated that in PD brain tissues, the SNpc had a lower number of expressed circRNAs when compared to other brain regions. In contrast, circSLC8A1 was significantly more expressed in PD. They also observed that the increase in oxidative stress leads to higher levels of this circRNA. Despite this, there was no change in the expression of host mRNA SLC8A1, previously associated with neurodegeneration [199]. Data suggest that alterations of circSLC8A1 expression occur due to either increased circularization or deregulation and consequent reduced degradation [199,200]. CircSLC8A1 has seven miR-128 binding sites, participating in the regulation of this microRNA. After circSLC8A1 knockdown, 24 miR-128 target mRNAs were differentially expressed, including neurodegenerative regulators, dopaminergic neuron protectors, regulators of mitochondrial function, and mRNAs involved in chronic inflammation [201,202]. Recent studies have focused on evaluating the roles of circRNAs in CNS disorders. Despite that, few studies focus on the role of circRNAs in PD [193,194].

Mitochondria are cytoplasmic organelles that are involved in essential processes for proper cellular functioning, such as calcium (Ca2+) buffering, regulation of cell death, lipid homeostasis, among other metabolic signals [203,204], but their most notable function is the generation of chemical energy (ATP, adenosine triphosphate) through the electron transport chain (ETC) in the process of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [173,204,205].

In this context, epigenetic mechanisms in mitochondria have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. For instance, reduced levels of mtDNA methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5mC) were observed in the D-loop region (but not in the other analyzed region, MT-ND6, which encodes a subunit of Complex I) in the SNpc of PD patients when compared to controls [247]. It should be noted that the differential methylation in nuclear genes related to mitochondrial apoptosis in association with cognitive and motor progression in PD was also reported, reinforcing mitochondrial influence on the evolution of this disease [248]. Similarly, a recent review by Lyu et al., (2019) [249] highlighted that mitochondrial-related lncRNAs might also play a role in PD through mitochondrial dysfunction or abnormalities in processes related to the management of oxidative stress, like mitophagy and apoptosis. Although there are currently few studies on this matter, it is increasingly clear that mitochondrial epigenetics may play an important role in the development and progression of PD and should be given more attention. Therefore, the investigation of different aspects in both mitochondrial genetics and epigenetics is presented as a promising strategy in the search for biomarkers of onset and treatment of PD, known to be a multifactorial disease.

The gut microbiome (GM) consists of trillions of microorganisms that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract and constantly interact with the host at multiple genetic and metabolic levels [250]. This community is known to have a strong effect on human health and its disruption has been associated with the development of various human diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic, immune, and neurodegenerative disorders [251,252]. The crosstalk between the microbiome, the gut and the nervous system is collectively referred to as the microbiota–gut–brain axis [253].

Gut microbiome data may be employed to determine the initial steps and progression of PD, considering not all patients experience enteric neurodegeneration at first. Additionally, profiling and measurement of GM metabolites could be applied to the clinical environment once we determine its predictive value to disease progression and/or prognosis. This could lead to personalized approaches in patient management as the GM could become a crucial part of PD treatment and diagnosis [286].

The multifactorial nature of PD poses a difficult obstacle for understanding the mechanisms involved in its onset and progression. However, it does provide a multitude of possibilities when it comes to the discovery of cellular pathways and biomarkers that can be employed for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Future efforts should focus on expanding population representation in PD databases as well as standardizing methods to avoid conflicting results due to different approaches.

We would like to highlight that, considering the increasing amount of data from genomics, epigenomics, metagenomics, and other various omics, it is essential to analyze data in an integrative approach to understand the complexity of PD, find disease-specific biomarkers for population screening, early detection, as well as discovering new therapies to attenuate disease progress.

The post-genomic era has expanded our knowledge on several molecular processes, producing data that have been applied for early diagnosis and improvement of patient care in various diseases, such as cancer. However, the same is not a reality when it comes to neurodegenerative disorders, mainly due to scarce data and the obstacles in fully understanding the molecular mechanisms leading to neuronal death. The data discussed in this review highlight that genomic variation, regulation by epigenomic mechanisms, as well as the influence of host gut microbiome have a crucial role in the onset and progress of PD. The investigation of these molecular aspects in a collaborative and multidisciplinary manner is key to the rise of personalized medicine for PD patients.
