Murine Methyl Donor Deficiency Impairs Early Growth in Association with Dysmorphic Small Intestinal Crypts and Reduced Gut Microbial Community Diversity

Folate and choline are essential methyl donor nutrients throughout the life span; however, the adverse effects of combined deficiency on early growth, intestinal epithelial morphology, and the gut microbiome remain only partially understood.

We investigated the effects of dietary folate and choline deficiency on early growth, small intestinal (SI) epithelial architecture, and the gut microbiota of mice. To explore potential mechanisms for adverse effects on gut epithelial morphology, we also evaluated gene expression and DNA methylation in mouse intestinal epithelial organoids (enteroids) maintained in methyl donor–deficient (MDD) conditions.

Pregnant dams were administered 1 of 4 diets: 1) control diet (CD−), 2) an isocaloric MDD− diet, or 3) CD+ and 4) MDD+ formulations containing 1% succinylsulfathiazole to inhibit folate-producing gut bacteria. We weaned pups to their dams’ diet at 3 wk of age and monitored body weight and tail length pre- and postweaning. We measured serum folate, SI crypt morphology, and microbiota composition at 7 wk of age.

Both MDD+ and MDD− diets impaired early ponderal and linear growth, lowered serum folate concentrations, and produced patchy areas of increased crypt depth throughout the SI. Succinylsulfathiazole increased crypt depth independently of diet. MDD or succinylsulfathiazole, alone or in combination, altered the gut microbiome, with decreased Bacteroidales and Clostridiales, increased Lactobacillales and Erysipelotrichaceae taxa, and decreased α-diversity indexes. Enteroids maintained in MDD media displayed dysmorphic crypt domains, altered expression of stem cell and secretory differentiation genes, and decreased DNA methylation of the glycosylation genes Beta-1,4-N-Acetyl-Galactosaminyltransferase-1 (B4galnt1) and Phosphoethanolamine/Phosphocholine-Phosphatase (Phospho1).

MDD impairs ponderal and linear growth in mice in association with dysmorphic SI crypts and reduced gut microbial diversity. In vitro methyl donor deficiency similarly induced dysmorphic crypts in mouse enteroids in conjunction with altered gene expression and DNA methylation.

Despite declining rates of folate deficiency worldwide, folate insufficiency remains a significant public health issue (1–3). Similarly, choline is abundant in common dietary constituents; however, ∼90% of individuals do not meet their adequate daily intake (4). Both folate and choline provide one-carbon units for the synthesis of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine, a ubiquitous component required for cell biosynthesis of a wide range of components that also plays a key role in DNA methylation, a fundamental epigenetic mechanism (5, 6). Further, both micronutrients are produced and consumed by gut microbiota; hence, animals not only obtain folate and choline from dietary sources but also share these nutrients with, and derive them from, resident gut microbes. Interest in adverse gut effects of deficiencies in folate and other methyl donor nutrients such as choline has risen in conjunction with greater appreciation of their interplay with epigenetics and the microbiome (7–9).

In the current study, we designed mouse experiments to investigate the effects of combined dietary folate and choline deficiency, without macronutrient restriction, on prenatal and postnatal growth, intestinal epithelial structure and function, and the gut microbiome. In addition, we tested the effects of choline and folate deficiency on crypt morphology, gene expression, and global DNA methylation in mouse small intestinal (SI) organoids. Here we report that: 1) MDD impairs ponderal and linear growth in conjunction with patchy findings of dysmorphic SI crypts and reduced gut microbial diversity and 2) in vitro MDD increases crypt length, alters the expression of genes involved in intestinal stem cell differentiation, and reduces DNA methylation of genes related to mucin production.

Wild-type C57BL/6 timed pregnant mice with pups at 11–14 days of gestation were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and housed in a barrier facility with an ambient temperature of 22°C, a relative humidity ranging from 30% to 70%, and a 14:10-h light-dark cycle. Pregnant females were placed in separate cages with free access to water and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental diets: 1) control diet (CD−); 2) control diet with succinylsulfathiazole 1% (10 g/kg) (CD+); 3) methyl donor–deficient diet without succinylsulfathiazole (MDD−); and 4) methyl donor–deficient diet with succinylsulfathiazole 1% (MDD+). These diets were continued through birth. Diets were associated with no clear group differences in litter size. Shortly after birth, litter sizes were adjusted to 5 or 6 pups/dam. Succinylsulfathiazole, an antibacterial sulfonamide that competes with the folate precursor para-aminobenzoic acid for the active site of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase (15), was added to the diet to eliminate or decrease the amount of folate and choline produced by intestinal microbiota. Each diet was formulated to meet all nutrient requirements (except for folate and choline) and to be isocaloric and isonitrogenous (Supplemental Table 1) on the basis of the analysis provided by the manufacturer (Research Diets, Inc.). All diets were irradiated before use and consumed ad libitum. Before weaning, dams and pups were weighed 3 times/wk. On day-of-life 23, pups were weaned to their dams’ diet, and then weighed 2 times/wk. In addition, food consumption was measured weekly after weaning. Weanlings were caged together (≤4/cage), according to their experimental group and sex. Mice were allowed access to food and water until the morning of death. Male mice were killed at 7 wk of age by carbon dioxide inhalation and cervical dislocation. Blood samples were obtained by retro-orbital access and cardiac puncture for complete blood count and folate concentrations. Intestinal tissue along multiple segments of the SI was obtained for histological analysis. All mouse protocols were approved by, and performed in accordance with, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.

Cross-sections of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were obtained at 2 cm and 8 cm from the gastric outlet and at 3 cm proximal to the cecum, respectively, to standardize the morphometric analysis. Segments were fixed in 4% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with routine hematoxylin-eosin. Crypt dimensions and crypt density were measured in a blinded manner using Image J version 1.47 h (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) software. Nuclear morphology was assessed by measuring the length of the major axis of the nuclei, using NIS Elements version 4.5 software.

For bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1.0 mL of concentrated reagent/100 g body weight. SI tissue was fixed and embedded in paraffin, as described above. Sections were stained as per the manufacturer-suggested protocol (BrdU kit; Invitrogen). Images were digitally captured using a 3007A Nikon 90i upright microscope, and quantification of BrdU staining was performed in a blinded manner by counting the number of BrdU-positive cells per 20 crypts in 3 mice/group, using NIS Elements version 4.5 software.

Mice were killed by carbon dioxide inhalation and cervical dislocation. Blood was collected by intracardiac puncture and centrifuged (2000 × g for 10 min at 4°C) to separate serum from RBCs. Serum samples were stored at −80°C for subsequent assays. Folate concentrations were measured by a specific ELISA (Cat# CEA610Ge, Cloud-Clone Corp.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Blood was collected from the retro-orbital plexus and immediately tested using an automated hematology analyzer (Hemavet 850; Drew Scientific) to obtain measurements of hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume.

Stools were collected from the cages of male mice at 6 wk of age (1–3 mice/cage). Harvest of jejunal tissue was performed at 7 wk of age. Stool and jejunal DNA were isolated using a QIAamp DNA extraction kit (QIAGEN). Each sample was immediately sealed in a cryo-tube and stored at −80°C until analysis.

We processed, filtered, and analyzed the 16S rRNA amplicon data using QIIME (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) version 1.9.0 (16). Paired-end reads were joined using join_paired_ends.py running the fastq-join method and requiring ≥200 bp of sequence overlap. Joined reads were demultiplexed using split_libraries_fastq.py requiring a Phred quality cutoff of 25 to remove ambiguous barcodes and low-quality reads. Reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using open-reference OTU picking at 97% sequence identity to the Greengenes database version 13.8 (17).

We identified OTUs differentiating samples by first filtering OTU tables to only include those OTUs present in ≥20% of the samples and with ≥1 sample having an average of 10 sequence counts across all samples. To the filtered OTU tables, we applied a Kruskal–Wallis test with a FDR cutoff of 10% using the group_significance.py script in QIIME. Heat maps on these OTUs passing at least an FDR < 0.1 were created using the make_otu_heatmap.py script in QIIME.

Intestinal organoids were prepared by isolating fresh mid-jejunal crypts using a previously described method (19). Briefly, the first proximal 4 cm of jejunum was isolated, washed, and treated with 2 mM cold EDTA for 30 min at 4°C and cut into 1-cm sections. The suspension was transferred into sucrose–sorbitol buffer, gently shaken for 2 min to release the intestinal crypts, and strained through 70-μm filters. After washing and centrifugation at 150 × g for 5 min at 4°C, the crypts were plated in a Corning Matrigel Growth Factor and reduced and incubated at 37°C to allow the polymerization of the Matrigel. Culture medium containing DMEM/F12, L-glutamine (200 nM), penicillin/streptomycin 1%, HEPES 10 mM, N2 1x, B27 1x, and the recombinant growth factors R-spondin (500 ng/mL), mouse Noggin (10 ng/mL), and mouse EGF (50 ng/mL) were added to the Matrigel. Enteroids were passaged weekly.

To study the effects of folate and choline deficiency, 2 types of culture media were used to maintain enteroids through 3 passages: medium containing regular concentrations of folate (2.65 mg/L) and choline (8.98 mg/L) found in regular DMEM/F12, or culture medium containing only 10% of these concentrations (folate: 0.27 mg/dL; choline: 0.9 mg/dL) prepared with a customized DMEM/F12.

RNA was isolated from mouse intestinal organoids using an Aurum Total RNA Mini Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized with the use of an iScrip Advanced cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). PCR commercial primers were acquired from Bio-Rad and are described in detail in Supplemental Table 2. PCR reactions were performed using the CFX384 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The reference gene β-actin was used to normalize all qPCR gene expression, which was plotted relative to this control gene. Enteroid PCR data were generated from tissue obtained from 3 mice (2 replicates each) whose intestinal organoids were cultivated for 3 consecutive passages.

Whole genome DNA methylation profiling by bisulfite-sequencing was performed and analyzed according to a previously published protocol (20). Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated from the pool of 5 wells (∼480 enteroids) per group, following the instructions of the manufacturer of the DNA isolation kit (Qiagen). DNA was sonicated and adaptor-ligated genomic DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite by the EZ DNA Methylation-Direct kit (Zymo Research). The treated DNA was amplified (18 cycles) using adaptor-specific primers and fragments of 200–500 bp were isolated. The amount and size distribution of libraries were determined using the Pico Green fluorescence and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, respectively. Each library was sequenced as 100-bp paired-end reads. Base calling was performed using the standard Illumina pipeline. After removing adaptor sequences and low-quality tails, reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome.

Methylation at specific CpG gene regions was quantified by bisulfite-pyrosequencing using the PyroMark Q96 MD instrument (21). Sequencing assays and primers are summarized in Supplemental Table 3. Positive controls (CpG Mehylase M. SssI-treated genomic DNA) and negative controls (whole genome amplified genomic DNA) were included for each assay, mixing experiments to reduce bias, and repeated experiments to assess reproducibility. Annealing temperatures were optimized to overcome PCR bias as previously reported (22).

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.0 (GraphPad) with bars indicating the mean ± SE. Comparisons of linear growth, weight, food consumption, food efficiency, crypt length, serum folate, hemoglobin, cell proliferation, and nuclear dimensions were made using 1-factor ANOVA with Bonferroni's posttest. Comparisons of gene expression and DNA methylation levels were made using t tests. For all analyses, a P value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Administration of MDD diets (with or without succinylsulfathiazole) to pregnant dams was not associated with fetal loss; however, MDD pups were markedly underweight relative to CD pups, with the lowest weight value seen in MDD− (no succinylsulfathiazole) weanlings on day of life 23 (MDD−, Figure 1A). MDD+ pups gained weight more quickly than MDD− pups during suckling (Figure 1A, P < 0.05); however, these relative differences did not persist beyond weaning (Figure 1B). Upon weaning to their dams’ diet, both MDD+ and MDD− mice remained significantly underweight relative to CD+ and CD− mice, respectively (Figure 1B). In the CD groups, succinylsulfathiazole administration produced no detectable effects on weight gain during either of the suckling or postweaning periods. Tail length, a surrogate for linear growth, was significantly reduced in both MDD− and MDD+ groups compared with the CD− group (Figure 1C). These differences in postweaning weight and length were not accounted for by differences in either food consumption (Figure 1D) or feed efficiency (Figure 1E); however, MDD− mice displayed significant hyperphagia relative to the other groups (Figure 1D). These results indicate that MDD impairs fetal, postnatal, and weanling growth in mice.

We measured serum folate status by ELISA upon killing at 7 wk of age (Figure 2A). Both MDD+ and MDD− mice were folate deficient relative to CD mice. However, MDD+ mice alone exhibited systemic manifestations of folate deficiency as evidenced by a modest but statistically significant decrease in hemoglobin concentrations (Figure 2B) compared with CD− mice (P < 0.05) and an increase in the mean corpuscular volume of erythrocytes also compared with CD− mice (Figure 2C), suggesting the presence of megaloblastic anemia.

To determine the extent to which the body growth and systemic effects of MDD and antibiotic exposure were accompanied by enteropathy, we examined crypt/villus architecture, epithelial proliferation, and intestinal epithelial nuclear morphology along the length of the SI. In MDD+ and MDD− mice, we detected patchy areas of crypt elongation in all segments of the SI (Figure 3). To our surprise, in both the duodenum and ileum, CD+ mice exhibited significant crypt hypertrophy (Figure 3). The most consistent and remarkable crypt hypertrophy was seen in the ileum (Supplemental Figure 1), with the CD+ group showing a statistically significant difference compared with the CD− group (P < 0.05 by ANOVA). In the ileum of the CD+ and MDD+ groups, the morphologic changes were more remarkable in comparison with the CD− group: crypt elongation, an increase in the population of goblet cells, and a decrease in the population of Paneth cells. BrdU staining of jejunal tissue suggested an apparent increase in proliferative activity in both CD+ and MDD+ groups; however, this difference was not statistically significant. In a limited number of mice, we compared midvillus nuclear morphology between groups to look for megaloblastic changes. We observed a nonstatistically significant trend towards increasing nuclear length from the CD− group, followed by the MDD−, CD+, and ultimately the MDD+ group (Figure 3E). Taken together, these results indicate that MDD induced a patchy crypt hypertrophy but that succinylsulfathiazole had a more pronounced effect than MDD on both SI crypt length and intestinal epithelial proliferation.

To determine whether the observed changes in body growth and SI crypt morphology in MDD and antibiotic-exposed mice corresponded to alterations in gut microbial communities, we measured the bacterial composition of jejunal homogenates and fecal pellets using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In the jejunum, succinylsulfathiazole administration significantly decreased sample α-diversity in CD mice (CD+ compared with CD−, P < 0.05) but not MDD mice (MDD+ compared with MDD− mice), suggesting that there are few bacteria present on the methyl-deficient diet targeted by succinylsulfathiazole (Figure 4A). We detected no difference in α-diversity between the CD+ and MDD+ mice (Figure 4A). In contrast, α-diversity was greater in CD− than in MDD− mice by the Shannon diversity index, i.e., MDD shifted the gut microbiota in the absence of antibiotics (P < 0.05) (Figure 5A). To determine the compositional differences among the mouse groups, we assessed β-diversity using the unweighted UniFrac metric. We observed that samples separated by antibiotic treatment (Figure 4B, PERMANOVA, P < 0.001, with controlling for cage effects); the MDD mice were distinguishable from the CD− mice, with the CD+ appearing intermediate to these groupings (Figure 4B; PERMANOVA, P < 0.01, with controlling for cage effects). In a comparison of discriminating microbial taxa with FDR < 0.1, we found a higher abundance of Bacteroidales and Clostridiales and a lower relative abundance of taxa within Lactobacillales and Erysipelotrichaceae species in the jejunum of CD− mice compared with all other groups (Supplemental Figure 2). No other taxa were significantly different between the CD− and MDD− mice nor were any taxa significantly different between the CD+ and MDD+ mice (FDRs > 0.1).

In stools, we observed a similar trend with greater α-diversity in CD− mice than in other groups [P < 0.05, data not shown; CD− (n = 5), CD+ (n = 5), MDD− (n = 4), MDD+ (n = 5)]. Also, the CD− mice were differentiable by the weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance metrics on the stool microbiome (PERMANOVA, P values <0.01, controlling for cage effects). Many of the same OTUs differentiated these mice as observed for the jejunum as well as an OTU belonging to the genus Oscillospira under the order Clostridiales, and several other taxa within the same groups as reported for the jejunum. As before, members of Bacteroidales and Clostridiales were enriched in CD− mouse stool and members of Lactobacillales and Erysipelotrichaceae were depleted (data not shown). No taxa were significantly different between the stools of CD− and MDD− mice nor CD+ and MDD+ mice (FDRs > 0.1, data not shown).

To determine the extent to which folate and choline deficiency directly affect crypt and intestinal stem cell dynamics ex vivo, we evaluated: 1) the morphology of crypt domains in murine jejunal enteroids under MDD conditions and 2) the effects of folate and choline deficiency on crypt morphology (see Figure 5). Jejunal enteroids grown in MDD media were viable but showed morphological differences relative to enteroids grown in standard media after 2 passages, with narrower crypt domains and fewer buds per crypt (P < 0.05, Figure 5C, D). Our qualitative impression of crypt domains in deficient media was an increased crypt:villus length ratio, suggesting a relative crypt hypertrophy. Because this hypertrophy might represent a deficit or altered differentiation of intestinal stem cells under folate- and choline-deficient conditions, we measured transcription of genes important for the commitment and differentiation of intestinal epithelial stem cells. As shown in Table 1, intestinal stem cell markers, including Ascl2 (P = 0.0002), Lrig1 (P = 0.0047), and Sox9 (P = 0.009), were decreased in the folate- and choline-deficient enteroids compared with controls. We detected no changes in the mRNA levels of the stem cell markers Lgr5 (P = 0.1831), Bmi1 (P = 0.7530), and Hopx (P = 0.4347). Expression of Atoh1 (a secretory lineages marker) was upregulated (P = 0.003) in folate- and choline-deficient media. In contrast, we observed no change in the levels of the secretory lineage marker, Hes1 (P = 0.6348). Taken together, these results suggest that folate and choline deficiency decreased the relative abundance of intestinal stem cell populations and increased the global secretory progenitor pool, but did not affect the absorptive lineage in enteroids.

To explore the hypothesis that combined folate and choline deficiency induces epigenetic effects in the gut epithelium, we compared DNA methylation in enteroids maintained under standard or MDD media conditions for 3 passages. To exclude the possibility that effects on DNA methylation of specific genes were simply due to changes in global DNA methylation, we first analyzed the methylation of 2 generic repetitive elements [inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) and Line1] and found that the methylation level of IAP in MDD media was decreased relative to control media (P = 0.04); however, Line1 methylation levels were similar in either condition (Figure 6). We next analyzed DNA methylation of select genes specifically at 3′ CGIs, a region in which decreased methylation results in decreased gene expression (23). We found that 2 genes related to mucus production, Beta-1,4-N-Acetyl-Galactosaminyltransferase-1 (B4galnt1; P = 0.0005) and Phosphoethanolamine/Phosphocholine-Phosphatase (Phospho1; P = 0.020) (Figure 6), exhibited significantly reduced DNA methylation in enteroids maintained in MDD media. We detected no changes in DNA methylation of lysophosphatidic acid receptor 5 (Lpar5), a gene involved in sodium and water absorption.

In this series of in vivo and ex vivo MDD (folate and choline) experiments in pregnant mice and their offspring, we observed persistent adverse effects of MDD on the growth and gut health of pups and weanlings. These adverse effects included weight and length faltering, megaloblastic changes of RBCs, modest lengthening of enterocyte nuclei, patchy crypt hypertrophy of the intestinal epithelium, and decreased diversity of SI and fecal microbial communities. We chose to introduce MDD diets to dams during pregnancy based on a previous study by Craciunescu et al. (24), who used a similar experimental design to induce folate deficiency in fetal mice.

In conclusion, dietary MDD impairs early ponderal and linear growth and is accompanied by dysmorphic changes in the crypts of the SI and decreased gut microbial community diversity in mice. In vitro, MDD modulates the expression of gene markers for intestinal stem cells and secretory lineages and decreases the DNA methylation of genes related to mucin production. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of these findings and ultimately translate them to methyl donor nutrient–based strategies to promote early gut health.
