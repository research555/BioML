Supplemental selenium source on gut health: insights on fecal microbiome and fermentation products of growing puppies

Selenium is an essential trace element that can modulate the gut microbiome with an impact on host health. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of organic (selenium-enriched yeast) vs inorganic (sodium selenite) selenium source on fecal end-fermentation products and gut microbiome of puppies from 20 to 52 weeks of age. Alpha and beta diversity of the gut bacterial community were affected by age but not by gender or selenium source. The relative abundance of taxa was differently affected by age, and the DNA concentration of all selected bacterial groups increased with age, although total volatile fatty acids (VFA), acetate, propionate, caproate and lactate concentrations decreased. Organic selenium was associated with a higher concentration of total VFA, propionate and butyrate, a higher number of DNA copies of Lactobacillus, and a trend to lower DNA copies of Escherichia coli. Effects on fecal microbiome during growth differed with selenium source. Females had higher fecal end-fermentation products related to protein degradation, whereas males had higher DNA concentration of Bifidobacterium. Organic selenium might be beneficial over inorganic for dog food supplementation due to the positive modulation of the gut microbiome observed in puppies.

The complex gut microbiome constitutes an intricate ecosystem that impacts the health of its host (Guard et al. 2017). Both the structure and composition of the gut microbiome are significantly affected by genetic and environmental factors. Indeed, this dynamic ecosystem undergoes modifications throughout the life of the host in response to normal changes in physiological states, such as growth and aging (Benno et al. 1992; Guard et al. 2017) or disease-induced situations (Barko et al. 2018). Among external factors, diet is the one that most rapidly alters the gut microbiome (Alessandri et al. 2019), having a positive or a negative impact on the host health and well-being.

The selenium requirements of animals are met through selenium sourced by raw ingredients and supplemental selenium. Inorganic sources of selenium are the most commonly used to supplement dog food, but organic selenium sources are more bioavailable for the animal (van Zelst et al. 2016). The canine gut microbiome has only recently begun to be studied and, to the best of our knowledge, no in vivo study has been performed to evaluate the effects of different sources of supplemental selenium on dogs' gut microbiome. In this context, the present study aimed to directly compare the effects of sodium selenite (inorganic selenium, SeInorg) and selenium yeast (organic selenium, SeOrg) supplemented at equal selenium levels in complete dry dog foods on the gut microbiome of puppies from 20 to 52 weeks of age. For that, fresh feces were collected at five-time points during growth, allowing us to explore the effects of selenium source, age and the interaction between selenium source and age on the bacterial profile, diversity and fecal fermentative end-products. This approach is expected to reveal possible existing interactions on the gut microbiome, rather than the evaluation of isolated genetic or environmental effects.

The trial was approved by the Local Animal Ethics Committee of Abel Salazar Biomedical Sciences Institute, University of Porto, and licensed by the Portuguese Directorate-General of Food and Veterinary Medicine (permit N.° 206/2017). Trained scientists in research animal care (FELASA category C) conducted the experiments, respecting good animal welfare practices.

A total of 12 Beagle puppies (6 males and 6 females) participated in the study from 12 until 52 weeks of age. The trial followed a complete randomized block design, in which puppies were distributed into six blocks of two animals and one puppy from each block was randomly allocated to one of two diets, only differing in the source of supplemental selenium. Both diets were complete dry foods formulated to meet nutrient and energy requirements of puppies after weaning up to 1-year-old (FEDIAF 2019) supplemented with either 220 μg/kg of sodium selenite (SeInorg); or with 5 mg/kg of selenium-enriched yeast from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Selplex®, Alltech, Nicholasville, KY; SeOrg; Table 1). Regardless of the source, the amount of supplemental selenium corresponded to ca. 20% of total selenium present in diets, which covered the daily requirements of dogs. The daily food intake was calculated to meet the metabolizable energy of puppies using the equation proposed by the National Research Council (2006). Dogs were kept in the university kennel and fed their daily amount in three individual meals (9.00, 14.00 and 17.00 h) up to 22 weeks of age, and thereafter in two meals (9.00 and 17.00 h). Fresh drinking water was provided ad libitum. The temperature and relative humidity of the kennel were monitored daily. Food consumption was registered daily. Hemogram, serum chemistry and urinalysis were performed regularly (each month up to 28 weeks of age and every two months after the 28th weeks of age) to check for dogs’ health.

In the last two days of 20, 28, 36, 44 and 52 weeks of age, fresh feces were collected within 1 h of defecation. Subsequently, fecal samples were pooled, weighed and split to be frozen at −80°C for fecal microbiota analysis and −20°C for the remaining analyses.

The determination of ammonia-N followed the protocol proposed by Valente et al. (2017). Briefly, 1 g of feces was diluted in 200 mL of ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ cm; Sartorius Arium®, Goettingen, Germany) and subjected to gas-diffusion microextraction with o-phthalaldehyde labeling for fluorimetric determination in a microplate reader (Synergy HT, Bio-Tek Instruments, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany). The pH of feces was measured in feces diluted to 1:10 in water using a potentiometer (pH and Ion-Meter GLP 22, Crison, Barcelona, Spain). For the determination of biogenic amines, 1 g of feces was diluted in 4 mL of 0.3 M perchloric acid and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a fluorescence detector as described by Stefanelli, Carat and Rossoni (1986).

Lactate was determined using a commercial kit (d- / l-Lactic acid, Nzytech, Lisboa, Portugal) adapted to a microplate format to allow UV detection in a microplate reader (Synergy HT, Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). The sample preparation included solubilization of 1 g of feces into 10 mL of ultrapure water aided by vortex and ultrasound (5 min). The samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 2415 × g, at 4°C. The supernatant was recovered, filtered using a 0.45 µm pore size polyethersulfone syringe filter (VWR International, Amadora Portugal), and assayed with the commercial kit. Lactic acid is presented as the sum of d- and l-lactic acid forms.

The concentration of VFA was determined by gas chromatography using a Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a capillary column (HP-FFAP, 30 m  ×  0.25 mm  ×  0.25 μm; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and a flame ionization detector. For sample preparation, 1 g of feces was solubilized in 10 mL of 25% ortho-phosphoric acid solution with an internal standard (4 mM 3-methyl valerate, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and centrifuged for 60 min at 5251 × g at 4°C. The supernatant was filtered using a 0.45 µm pore size polyethersulfone syringe filters (VWR International) and injected for analysis. Individual VFA were identified by comparison of retention times with a commercial standard and quantified with the internal standard method as described by Maia et al. (2016).

Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from 200 mg of frozen fecal samples. The DNA extraction was performed using a stool DNA isolation kit (Norgen Biotek Corp., ON, Canada) following all the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. The purity and concentration of the isolated DNA were evaluated with a spectrophotometer (DS-11, DeNonix®, Wilmington, DE). The DNA template was diluted to 50 ng/μL and stored at −20°C for further analysis.

The hypervariable V3–V4 regions of the 16S rRNA encoding gene were sequenced at StarSEQ (Mainz, Germany). The F341/R806b primer set and AccuStart II PCR ToughMix® (Quantabio, Beverly, MA) were used for the reaction as described by Takahashi et al. (2014), and Apprill et al. (2015). Amplicons were generated by a single-step of 33 cycles using a Thermocycler T-Professional (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) and checked for quality with QIAxcel® capillary electrophoresis (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), normalized and pooled for quantification. Over 15% of the PhiX control library was spiked into the amplicon pool to improve the unbalanced and biased base composition. The sequencing primers for forward sense strand (5′-GGCTGACTGACT-3′) and reverse sense strand (5′-CCAATTACCATA-3′) were added to MiSeq Reagent Kit V3 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and positive control (ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community DNA Standard; Zymo Research Corp., CA). The 2 × 300 bp pair-end sequencing was run on a MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA).

The sequences from the MiSeq Illumina were analyzed using the QIIME 2 version 2018.6 (Bolyen et al. 2019). Raw reads were de-multiplexed and quality checked by FastQC (Andrews 2010). Paired-end reads were joined by the tool PEAR. Low-quality reads were removed. Reads were corrected, chimeras were removed and Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were obtained by the deblur workflow (Amir et al. 2017). Then, a multiple sequence alignment (Katoh et al. 2002) and a phylogenetic tree were generated (Price, Dehal and Arkin 2009). Alpha diversity rarefaction curves were generated for each category (selenium source, gender and the week of age) and each sample individually. Taxonomy was assigned to ASVs using a Naive–Bayes approach of the scikit-learn Python library (Bokulich et al. 2018) and the SILVA database (Quast et al. 2013). Interactive stacked bar-charts of the taxonomic abundances of each category and each sample were generated. Alpha and beta diversity metrics were calculated after normalization by rarefaction (at the lowest sample size). Alpha diversity metrics were calculated using Shannon's diversity index and Faith's phylogenetic diversity to assess the community's richness and Pielou's Evenness to assess the community's evenness. Beta diversity metrics calculated were Weighted and Unweighted UniFrac distances to assess community dissimilarity. The Principal Coordinate Analysis was used to plot the distance matrixes.

Total bacteria, Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., E. coli, F. prausnitzii and Clostridium cluster I were quantified by quantitative polimerase chain reaction (qPCR). Detailed information of qPCR assay is presented in Table 2. Amplification was run in duplicate with a total volume of 15 μL, 1.5 μL of DNA template, 7.5 μL of 2x SensiFASTNo-ROX PCRMasterMix (Bioline GmbH, Luckenwalde, Germany), 4.8 μL of nuclease-free water and 0.6 μL of each 10 pmol primers. Amplification and detection were carried out in a CFX96 Touch thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) after an initial denaturation of 2 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, primer annealing (56–64°C) for 10 s and 72°C for 8 s. The standard curves were obtained from seven 10-fold dilution series of the target species genomic DNA. Standard curves were run in triplicates. A negative control (DNase-free water) was run for each primer assay. Melting curve analysis was performed after the amplification to check the consistency of the amplification of the single product with the set melting temperature.

QIIME 2 workflow was used to select ASV, sequence alignment, inferring phylogenetic trees and phylogenetic and taxon-based analysis of alpha and beta diversity within and between samples as described by Caporaso et al. (2010). Given the nonparametric nature of microbiota data, indices of alpha diversity data were analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis test. Differences in beta diversity were analyzed using the non-parametric Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) with 999 permutations. P-values were corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg False Discovery Rate method.

DNA concentration, fecal pH and concentration of end-fermentation products were analyzed according to a Generalized Linear Mixed Model with repeated measurements (SAS® University Edition 2019, Cary, NC). The model included selenium source, gender, age and selenium source × age interaction (if the interaction had P < 0.1) as fixed effects, block as a random effect and age in the subject dog as a repeated measure. Taxa with relative abundance > 0.01% and present in at least 50% of the samples (which corresponded to 95% of total reads) was analyzed using a Negative Binomial Generalized Linear Mixed Model (Proc Glimmix of SAS®) including selenium source, gender, age and selenium source × age interaction (if the interaction had P < 0.1) as fixed effects, and block as a random effect. The statistical level of significance was considered for P < 0.05, while the trend was set for P < 0.1. The least significant difference post-hoc test was used to compare means.

The total number of sequences obtained after filtering for quality, trimming length and assigning taxonomy was 5151 331 from 60 samples with an average of 85 885 ± 24 931 reads per sample (range 35 646–137 908). A total of 1 886 operational taxonomy units (OTU) were identified, and 174 assigned to the genus level. After rarefaction, normalizing to the sample with the lowest number of sequences (5782), 341 138 sequences were retained (46.1%) in 58 samples. The number of observed OTUs per sample ranged from 65 to 171 (Table 3). Rarefaction curves were adequate for the analysis, as they all tended to a plateau (Figures S1–S3, Supporting Information). The number of OTUs and richness community indexes (Shannon's diversity index and Faith's phylogenetic diversity), and community evenness (Pielou's Evenness) were affected by the age of puppies (P < 0.001; Tables 3 and S1, Supporting Information), with alpha diversity lower at 20 weeks of age, but they were not affected by selenium source nor gender (P > 0.05, Tables 3, S2 and S3, Supporting Information).

Principal coordinate analysis based on Weighted and Unweighted UniFrac distances showed differences associated with age (Fig. 1A and B). Samples collected at 20 weeks of age differed from all other weeks, suggesting changes in the overall microbiome composition (Fig. 1A) and higher weight of low-abundance taxa (Fig. 1B). Though, no quantitative and qualitative differences in microbiota diversity were observed between males and females nor between SeInorg and SeOrg (Fig. 1C–F). Differences among weeks were confirmed by PERMANOVA analysis on Unweighted UniFrac distances (pseudo-F = 5.58; P = 0.001¸ pairwise PERMANOVA results available in Table S4, Supporting Information), which also revealed no effects of selenium source (pseudo-F = 0.70; P > 0.835) and gender (pseudo-F = 0.71; P > 0.843). Similarly, PERMANOVA analysis on Weighted UniFrac distances showed an effect of age (pseudo-F = 6.99; P = 0.001; pairwise PERMANOVA results available in Table S4, Supporting Information), but not of selenium source (pseudo-F = 0.35; P > 0.814) and gender (pseudo-F = 1.14; P > 0.332).

After normalization of sequence reads into relative abundances, 10 phyla, 15 classes, 33 orders, 62 families and 174 genera were identified. From these, only 5 phyla, 9 classes, 11 order and 17 families presented relative abundances above 1%, and 28 genera above 0.5% (Fig. 2). Fusobacterium, Turicibacter, Prevotella 9 and Peptoclostridium represented together roughly 50% of the total genus presented, whereas the sum of 146 genera with relative abundances lower than 0.05%, corresponded to 5–10%.

Males presented higher counts of family Muribaculaceae and genus [Eubacterium] brachy group (P < 0.05) and tended to have enrichment of family Eggerthellaceae, and genera Peptococcus and Ruminococcaceae UCG-014 (P < 0.1). Contrarily, female feces tended to have higher counts of Firmicutes and a higher abundance of genus Fusicatenibacter.

The results of the qPCR are displayed in Table 6. Age increased the number of DNA copies of total bacteria, Clostridium cluster I, Enterococci spp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Lactobacillus spp. (P < 0.001). The number of DNA copies of E. coli was higher at week 28 of age and similar among the remaining weeks (P = 0.001). Organic selenium increased the DNA concentration of Lactobacillus spp. (P = 0.024) and tended to decrease the DNA concentration of E. coli (P = 0.055). The interaction between selenium source and age tended to affect the number of DNA copies of Bifidobacterium spp. (P = 0.099; data not shown). Bifidobacterium spp. was also affected by gender (P = 0.002), being higher in males.

Table 7 presents the pH and the ammonia-N, biogenic amines, lactate and VFA contents of fresh feces collected at five time-points from 20 to 52 weeks of age, and Table   8 displays the interaction between selenium source and age (for P < 0.05). Fecal pH and ammonia-N were unaffected by gender (P > 0.05), but they were affected by the interaction between selenium source and age (P < 0.05). The fecal pH of dogs fed both selenium sources was similar within weeks, except for 44 weeks of age in which SeOrg promoted higher pH than that of SeInorg. Ammonia-N content was the highest at 36 weeks of age for both selenium sources and the lowest at weeks 20 and 52 in feces of dogs fed SeInorg and at weeks 28 and 52 in those fed SeOrg.

The total VFA production and concentrations of acetate, propionate, caproate and lactate decreased with age (P < 0.001). In turn, iso-caproate increased with age (P = 0.014), whereas butyrate and valerate fluctuated along the weeks (P < 0.05). Organic selenium increased total VFA production and concentrations of butyrate and propionate (P = 0.05) and tended to increase lactate concentration (P = 0.084). The interaction between selenium source and age affected the concentrations of valerate and iso-caproate (P < 0.05) and tended to affect lactate, iso-valerate and heptanoate (P < 0.1, data not shown). Valerate was similar in both selenium sources at weeks 20, 28 and 36, whereas at weeks 40 and 52 was higher in dogs fed SeOrg. Similarly, fecal iso-caproate concentration was similar between SeInorg and SeOrg along age, except at week 44, being higher in feces of dogs fed SeOrg. Males had a higher fecal concentration of iso-valerate, iso-caproate and caproate (P < 0.05), and tended to have a higher content of acetate (P = 0.060).

This study was designed to evaluate the effects of supplemental selenium source (sodium selenite and selenium-enriched yeast) on the gut microbiome of puppies from 20 to 52 weeks of age. The effects of gender were also evaluated.

The results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing generally agree with earlier reports of healthy individuals. Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria. Previous studies have shown that Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla in the dogs’ gut microbiome (Beloshapka et al. 2013). Among them, Clostridium spp., Lactobacillales and Proteobacteria predominate in the small intestine and Clostridiales, Bacteroides, Prevotella 9 and Fusobacteria in the large intestine (Suchodolski 2016).

Alpha diversity metrics evaluate the community richness and evenness within each sample, whereas beta diversity metrics assess the similarity of the community within groups (Lozupone et al. 2007). Our results showed that age significantly affected the alpha and beta diversity indexes, with the most notable changes between the 20th week of age and the remaining. In a study performed in dogs from 2 to 56 days of age, beta diversity reached relative stability after 42 days of age, yet differences between dams and puppies were still apparent by the 56th day of age (Guard et al. 2017). No study of the gut microbiome of puppies in later stages of development is available. However, a study performed with kittens, observed that the structural and functional diversity of microbiome differ between 18 and 30 weeks of age, but not between 30 and 42 weeks of age (Deusch et al. 2015), similarly to our results.

Biogenic amines, in which polyamines are included, are low molecular weight organic compounds sourced externally in pet food or raw ingredients (Learey et al. 2018) or internally by e.g. intestinal microbiota, pancreatic-biliary secretions and dead intestinal cells (Ramos-Molina et al. 2019). Exogenous polyamines in foods are usually absorbed before they reach the large bowel (Ramos-Molina et al. 2019), so it is likely that an important share found in feces was synthesized in the gut by decarboxylase-positive microorganisms such as Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, E. coli and lactic acid bacteria (Espinosa-Pesqueira, Roig-Sagues and Hernandez-Herrero 2018). Putrescine, spermine and spermidine derive from l-arginine or l-ornithine depending on the microorganism involved, and the degradation and recycling of biogenic amines comprise, among others, the conversion of putrescine into spermine and this into spermidine and vice-versa (Fernandez-Reina, Urdiales and Sanchez-Jimenez 2018). These biogenic amines have physiological roles as cell viability, proliferation and correct differentiation (Fernandez-Reina, Urdiales and Sanchez-Jimenez 2018). Cadaverine is formed via lysine decarboxylase (Barbieri et al. 2019) and has mitigated the pathogenicity process of Shigella spp. (from which is released), due to the protective effect cadaverine can exert on intestinal mucosa from enterotoxins (Tofalo, Cocchi and Suzzi 2019). However, being associated with cell proliferation, polyamines are essential for both normal and neoplastic cells, and indeed, higher levels have been associated with carcinogenesis in dogs (Rossi et al. 2015). Putrescine and cadaverine decreased from 20 to 52 weeks of age but had peaks at the 28th and 36th week of age. These observations might be associated with the variation of relative abundance of order Bacilli as these biogenic amines are mostly produced by Gram-negative bacteria (Pugin et al. 2017). Also, spermine content tended to decrease with age, which might be due to lower amino acid decarboxylation by bacteria or be related to the decrease of putrescine, a precursor of spermine. It is likely that at a younger age, the requirements for biogenic amines are higher due to growth and the decrease of their content thereafter seems positive for longevity, as their excess is detrimental and relates to tumors and deleterious effects of aging (Matsumoto et al. 2011).

Although the alpha and beta diversity of the community remained unaffected by the selenium source, there were differences in taxa abundance of particular genera and families.

Our results suggest that the selenium sources under test modulated differently the gut microbiome. This observation agreed with a study of Dalia et al. (2018), which compared the combination of vitamin E with either sodium selenite or bacterial organic selenium for broiler supplementation, observing an increase of DNA concentrations of Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria and a decrease of E. coli and Salmonella.

Taxa abundance and concentration of some end-fermentation products were affected by the interaction between age and source of selenium.

In turn, fecal iso-caproate was similar between selenium sources within weeks, except at week 44, in which a higher concentration was observed in feces of dogs fed SeOrg. Iso-caproate is a minor branched-chain fatty acid formed through oxidation of leucine yet poorly documented in terms of biological effects. C. difficile was reported to produce it from the degradation of l-leucine, by first oxidizing the amino acid with the formation of iso-valerate and later reduction (in presence of CO2) to iso-caproate (Kim et al. 2006). In neonatal humans, it has been positively correlated with Xanthomonadaceae (Proteobacteria) and Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) and negatively correlated with Bifidobacterium (Del Chierico et al. 2015). However, in our study, both DNA concentration and counts of Bifidobacterium were not affected by the supplemental selenium source.

Gender did not affect the alpha and beta diversity of the gut microbiome, yet we observed differences in counts of a few bacterial groups. Genus Fusicatenibacter was higher in females, which agrees with a result reported in healthy humans (Hirakawa et al. 2019). In males, [Eubacterium] brachy group and family Muribaculaceae were more abundant. Despite in dogs the gender effect has not been reported in these taxa, a higher abundance of Muribaculaceae was reported in male wild type mice (Son et al. 2019).

In the present study, the gender effects should be interpreted with caution due to the limted number of animals used. Nevertheless, our innovative findings highlight the importance of conducting further research to understand sex-driven differences in the gut microbiome of dogs.

The gut microbiome of puppies shifted with growth. We observed differences in both alpha and beta diversity, and an overall increase in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and a decrease of Firmicutes. Moreover, DNA concentration of total bacteria and selected bacterial groups increased with age, while the fecal total VFA production and concentrations of butyrate, propionate and acetate decreased, which might be explained by increased absorption. Gender had a minor effect on microbiome composition, affecting only some individual taxa and a few fecal end-fermentation products. Although selenium source did not affect alpha and beta diversity, it modulated the gut microbiome of dogs differently. Organic selenium tended to decrease the DNA concentration of E. coli, an important enteropathogen, and increased that of Lactobacillus. However, the effects of selenium source on gut microbiome relative abundance may be affected by growth. Total VFA, butyrate and propionate concentrations were promoted by organic selenium, which is beneficial for the gut immunity and health of puppies.
