Environmental microcystin targets the microbiome and increases the risk of intestinal inflammatory pathology via NOX2 in underlying murine model of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease

With increased climate change pressures likely to influence harmful algal blooms, exposure to microcystin, a known hepatotoxin and a byproduct of cyanobacterial blooms can be a risk factor for NAFLD associated comorbidities. Using both in vivo and in vitro experiments we show that microcystin exposure in NAFLD mice cause rapid alteration of gut microbiome, rise in bacterial genus known for mediating gut inflammation and lactate production. Changes in the microbiome were strongly associated with inflammatory pathology in the intestine, gut leaching, tight junction protein alterations and increased oxidative tyrosyl radicals. Increased lactate producing bacteria from the altered microbiome was associated with increased NOX-2, an NADPH oxidase isoform. Activationof NOX2 caused inflammasome activation as shown by NLRP3/ASCII and NLRP3/Casp-1 colocalizations in these cells while use of mice lacking a crucial NOX2 component attenuated inflammatory pathology and redox changes. Mechanistically, NOX2 mediated peroxynitrite species were primary to inflammasome activation and release of inflammatory mediators. Thus, in conclusion, microcystin exposure in NAFLD could significantly alter intestinal pathology especially by the effects on microbiome and resultant redox status thus advancing our understanding of the co-existence of NAFLD-linked inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes in the clinic.

The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing proportionately1. Fatty liver disease is defined as a benign and non-phenotypic (micro vesicular and macro vesicular) accumulation of fat in the liver which often remains asymptomatic for years and assumes a role of a silent killer since it takes years to develop into a potentially full blown disease2,3. Following a second hit or as is proclaimed in recent years, multiple hits can progress from a condition of fatty liver (NAFLD) to a more progressive inflammatory condition called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)4,5. NASH is a potentially progressive liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, and death. NAFLD and subsequent NASH is also associated with extrahepatic manifestations such as chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and sleep apnoea6. Interestingly patients with type 2 diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can also have parallel NAFLD-like conditions7. NAFLD and its more progressive inflammatory form NASH have similar comorbidities in the intestine or can result in colon polyps8.

Based on the startling evidence of the menace of NAFLD that has assumed pandemic proportions, its progression to NASH and comorbidities and the increasing threat of environmental pollution from cyanobacterial toxins, we test the hypothesis that chronic low dose exposure of microcystin acts as a second hit in the progression of ectopic intestinal manifestations of NAFLD/NASH in susceptible populations. In addition, microcystin exposure-induced NAFLD severity and ectopic inflammation in the intestine arises primarily from its effect on gut microbiome and subsequent inflammatory pathways in the intestine. Using a rodent model of NAFLD, the study describes the mechanisms that lead to progressive inflammatory condition in the intestine, a mostly asymptomatic and under reported consequence in this disease. The results described in this study help advance our understanding the underlying pathology in NASH-associated comorbidities.

Microcystin (MC) was purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, Michigan). Anti- claudin-2, anti-occludin, anti-HMGB1, anti-F4/80, anti-NLRP3, anti-caspase1, anti-GP91phox and anti-IL1β primary antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Anti-ASC2, anti-p47phox anti-3Nitrotyrosine primary antibody was purchased from Santacruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). Species-specific biotinylated conjugated secondary antibodies and Streptavidin-HRP (Vectastain Elite ABC kit) were purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence-conjugated (Alexa Fluor) secondary antibodies, ProLong Gold antifade mounting media with DAPI were purchased from Thermofisher Scientific (Grand Island, NY) and all other chemicals which were used in this project purchased from sigma only if otherwise specified. Paraffin-embedding of tissue sections on slides were done by AML laboratories (Baltimore, MD). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company.

Pathogen-free, adult (8 weeks old), male C57BL/6 J (WT) mice and p47 phox gene deleted (p47phox KO- B6 (Cg)-Ncflm1J/J) mice (Jackson Laboratories, Ban Harbor, ME) were used in the study. The groups used for the experiment were the wild type mice fed with chow diet only(Lean Control), wild type mice fed with methionine choline deficient- high fat diet only (NAFLD), wild type mice fed with chow diet and then exposed to microcystin(Chow + MC), wild type mice fed with methionine choline deficient diet and then exposed to microcystin(NAFLD + MC), one group of p47 phox KO mice fed with chow diet and exposed with microcystin(CHOW + MC p47phox KO)and another group of p47 phox KO mice fed with methionine choline deficient diet and then exposed to microcystin(NAFLD + MC p47phox KO). The total number of animals in each group were assessed based on the calculations that ensured enough statistical power of 0.5. There were 8 mice per group that were allocated to their respective cages following the procedure of randomization. A total of 48 mice were used in the experiments for the paper. All mice experiments were carried out based on the approval of the institutional animal ethics committee (IACUC) at the University of South Carolina (Assurance number: D16-00028).

Pathogen-free, male, C57BL/6 J (WT) and the p47phox gene deleted mice (p47 phoxKO) were fed with methionine choline deficient (MCD-HFD) diet from 8 weeks to 14weeks for diet-induced NAFLD model until the experimental dosing was over and were euthanized soon after. The mice weighed about 25 grams during the time of euthanizing. All mice had ad libitum access to food and water and were housed in a temperature controlled room at 23–24 °C with a 12-hour light/dark cycle. All animals were treated in strict accordance with the NIH Guide for the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and local IACUC standards. We and others have reported previously about the role of NADPH oxidase in the pathology of NASH. NADPH oxidase is comprised of several cytoplasmic and membrane subunits which align on the membrane for an activated enzyme system. P47 phox is the cytosolic subunit of NADPH oxidase and a gene deleted P47 phox mouse was used to ascertain the role of the enzyme in the pathology of microcystin-induced progression of intestinal comorbidities inNASH. A detailed experimental design is described in Fig. 1A,B.

Wild-type control and gene specific knockout mice (p47phox KO), fed with MCD-HFD diet for 6 weeks were then administered with microcystin (10 µg per kg of mouse, 5 dosages per week), through the intraperitoneal route for two weeks. The dosage was given each afternoon at the same time to eliminate any bias in the study. Since this is a sub-chronic study, the cumulative effect of the microcystin on inflammatory phenotypes was considered. The mice were euthanized at the completion of dosage and serum and small intestine tissue was collected for further processing.

16S rRNA gut microbial profiling was done on fecal pellets and luminal contents which were collected immediately after euthanasia and stored at −80 °C. For 16S rRNA sequencing, genomic DNA was extracted from 100 mg of the fecal pellets and luminal contents by using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to instructions from the manufacturer. DNA libraries were prepared by amplification of the 16S rRNA V3-V4 hypervariable region with added Illumina adapter overhang nucleotide sequences and sequencing with Illumina (San Diego, CA) MiSeq platform. Sequenced reads were than analyzed using Nephele (https://nephele.niaid.nih.gov), an open-source analysis tool provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Office of Cyber Infrastructure and Computational Biology (OCICB) in Bethesda, MD20. For microbial profiling, QIIME FASTQ paired end with chimera removal, open reference, and SILVA rRNA database project (Silva_99) options were used.

Immortalized rat intestinal epithelial cell line (IEC-6) was grown and maintained in complete DMEM media containing high glucose, Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (ITS) and 10% FBS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After overnight serum starvation (2.0% FBS) the cells were then treated with vehicle (control, C), Rat Leptin (100 µg/mL), Microcystin (100 μg/mL), Apocynin(100 µg/ml), 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide [DMPO; (100 µg/ml)]and phenylboronic acid[FBA;(100 µg/ml)], separately or in combinations for 24 h. The groups for the in-vitro cell treatments were cells only (Control), cells + rat Leptin (Leptin), cells + rat leptin + microcystin (Leptin + MC), cells + apocynin + rat leptin + microcystin (Leptin + MC + Apocynin), cells + phenylboronic acid + leptin + microcystin (Leptin + MC + FBA). Upon completion of treatment, cells and supernatant were processed for PCR, ELISA and immunofluorescence imaging. All the in-vitro experiments were performed three times (Fig. 1B).

mRNA expression in intestinal epithelial cell line was examined by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from the cultured cells and was purified with the use of RNeasy mini kit columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized from purified RNA (1 μg) using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA) following the manufacturer’s standard protocol. Real-time qPCR (qRTPCR) was performed with the gene-specific primers using SsoAdvanced SYBR GreenSupermix and CFX96 thermal cycler (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA). Threshold Cycle (Ct) values for the selected genes were normalized against respective samples internal control (18S). Each reaction was carried out in triplicates for each gene and for each sample. The relative fold change was calculated by the 2-ΔΔCt method using cells only as a control. The sequences for the primers used for Real-time PCR are provided in Table 1.

Immunoreactivity of HMGB1 was detected in the supernatant of the rat intestinal epithelial cell (IEC-6) groups using Rat High Mobility Group Box 1 Protein ELISA kit (Abclonal Biotechnology co., Ltd) following manufacturer’s protocol. Concentrations of HMGB1 (ng/ml) per well was detected from the standard curve.

Serum Endotoxin(EU/ml) was detected in the mice groups fed with Chow diet treated with microcystin, NAFLD mice, NAFLD mice treated with microcystin and p47phox knockout mice (fed on both Chow and NAFLD diet) treated with microcystin using Pierce LAL Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation Kit (Thermo Scientific) following manufacturer’s protocol.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, 5 µm thick intestine sections were used for histopathology by standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining method and IHC staining. The sections were randomly selected from jejunum and ileal sections of the small intestine. Deparaffinization of the sections followed by heat based epitope retrieval and both endogenous peroxidase blocking (3% H2O2, 5 min) and serum blocking (5% normal serum, 1 h) were carried out. Further, sections were incubated with primary antibody (1:500) for 2 h at RT and then species-specific anti-IgG secondary antibodies and conjugation with HRP was performed using Vectastain Elite ABC kit following manufacturer’s protocols. Finally, 3, 3-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) were used as a chromogen substrate and counter stained with Mayer’s hematoxylin. Morphometric analysis was done using CellSens Software from Olympus America.

The deparaffinized intestine tissue section from all the mice groups was subjected to epitope retrieval and permeabilization (0.01% triton X-100) followed by blocking with 5% normal serum. Fixed rat intestinal epithelial cells on the cover glass were subjected to permeabilization (0.01% triton X-100) followed by blocking with 10% normal serum. Further, both tissue sections and cells were incubated with primary antibody (1:250) overnight at 4 °C. Species-specific anti-IgG secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa fluor 633 (red) and Alexa fluor 488 (green) was used to observe the antigen-specific immunoreactivity. Sections were mounted in Prolong gold antifade reagent with DAPI (counter stain). Morphometric analysis was done using CellSens Software from Olympus America.

Rat intestinal epithelial cells were treated with the nitric oxide (NO) donor (DETA-NONOate) separately and with the combination of DMPO (100 µg/ml) (DETA-NONOate + DMPO) and phenylboronic acid (FBA; 100 µg/ml) (DETA-NONOate + FBA). The supernatants were collected and concentration of ATP (µM) per well was detected using Colorimetric ATP Assay kit (from Abcam) following manufacturer’s protocol.

Concentration of nitrite (µM) per well was detected in the rat intestinal epithelial cell supernatants treated with Leptin and Microcystin using Griess reagent system kit (Promega, USA) following manufacturer’s protocol.

All in vivo experiments were repeated three times with at least eight mice per group (N = 8); data from each group of eight mice were pooled). Based on our preliminary data conducted prior to the detailed experiments reported in this manuscript, the Type I error rate (α) corresponded to a desired p value for statistical hypothesis testing. For animal numbers the ‘standard’ α value was set up as 0.05. The power of an animal experiment (1-β) and corresponded to the probability of a detecting a result that is a true. Accordingly, power levels were set to 0.8 and all animal numbers were calculated accordingly. All alpha and power values were calculated using the PS software from Vanderbilt University. The statistical analysis was carried out by unpaired t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for assessing difference between multiple groups. For all analysis P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For experiments involving 2 groups where distribution of data was not clearly parametric, Mann-Whitney U tests were performed with GraphPad Prism Software Inc, CA, Version 5.03. For experiments involving 3 or more groups, data were evaluated using one-way ANOVA with multiple comparison post hoc analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM, or as absolute number or percentage for categorical variables. The significance level was set at α = 5% for all comparisons.

Microcystin is known to primarily affect the liver, being a potential hepatotoxin. To study the effects of microcystin in the liver, we fed the mice with MCD-HFD diet to induce the condition of NAFLD, and then exposed them with microcystin (NAFLD + MC). There was high deposition of fat droplets in the NAFLD liver tissue compared to the lean control mouse. The liver tissue from the NAFLD + MC showed increased inflammation, with infiltration of leukocytes when compared to the chow diet fed mice exposed with Microcystin (Fig. 2Ai–iv). CD68 is known to be the marker for activated Kupffer cells during liver inflammation. To determine whether microcystin had a role in activating the Kupffer cells in the liver, the immunoreactivities of Kupffer cells were analyzed in liver tissue slices (Fig. 2Bi–iv,C). The results showed a significant increase in CD68 immunoreactivity in the CHOW + MC group compared to the lean control mice (CHOW) (*p < 0.05), and simultaneously a significant increase in NAFLD + MC mice compared to the NAFLD only group (*p < 0.05).

NAFLD is accompanied by altered gut microbiota with increases in phylum abundance of Firmicutes and a subsequent decrease in Bacteriodetes21. Similar trends are also observed in NAFLD associated inflammatory bowel disease22. To study the effects of chronic low dose microcystin exposure in NAFLD, metagenomic analysis of fecal pellets in mice were analyzed. Results showed that NAFLD + MC group had an increase in the phylum Firmicutes compared to the NAFLD only group, and a significant increase in proteobacteria (p < 0.01) followed by a marked decrease in the phylum Bacteroidetes when compared to NAFLD only group (Fig. 3A). Similar trends of a significant increase were observed in the phylum abundance of Firmicutes and proteobacteria of the Chow + MC group, compared to the Lean Control (LC) group (Fig. 3A). There was a significant decrease in the phylum abundance of Verrucomicrobia in the Chow + MC group compared to the Lean Control (p < 0.01). No significant changes were observed in the phylum abundance of Verrucomicrobia in the NAFLD + MC group, when compared to the NAFLD only group (Fig. 3A). The order Clostridiales showed a significant increase in abundance in the NAFLD + MC group when compared to NAFLD only group while there was a significant decrease in the abundance of Bacteriodales in the NAFLD + MC group when compared to NAFLD only group (P < 0.01) (Fig. 3B). The order abundance of Clostridiales also showed a significant increase in the Chow + MC group, compared to the Lean control (LC) group. Verrucomicrobiales showed a significant decrease in the Chow + MC group compared to the Lean Control (LC) group (Fig. 3B). Analysis of the abundance of family showed a significant increase in Clostridiaceae in NAFLD + MC groups when compared to NAFLD only group (p < 0.01) followed by increase in Lachnospiraceae, an observation consistent with both IBD and NAFLD (Fig. 3C). Similar trends of the significant increase in the family of Clostridiaceae and Lachnospiraceae (p < 0.01) in Chow + MC group compared to the lean control (LC) group were also observed (Fig. 3C). At the genus level, abundance of Bacteriodes decreased significantly in the NAFLD + MC group when compared to NAFLD only group (p < 0.01) while Blautia and Intestinibacter abundance increased significantly in the NAFLD + MC group when compared to NAFLD only group (p < 0.05)(Fig. 3D). Increase in the Intestinibacter genus abundance was observed in the Chow + MC group, compared to the Lean Control (LC) group (Fig. 3D). Lactobacillus and Enterococcus genus that are widely known as lactate producing bacteria increased significantly in NAFLD + MC group when compared to NAFLD only group (p < 0.05)(Fig. 3E,F)23. The data is consistent with human NAFLD and intestinal comorbidities severity since the increased level of the genus Intestinibacter, the family Lachnospiraceae, the genus Escherichia, Shigella, and the family Enterobacteriaceae may be a primary contributor to NAFLD progression24.

Intestinal pathology in inflammatory bowel disease assumes a marked signature of epithelial cell loss, disruption of villous structures, crypt abscess and granulation25. To study the effect of microcystin exposure and the resultant worsened dysbiosis in NAFLD, a detailed histopathological examination was carried out. Results showed that NAFLD + MC had highly disrupted villi structure, increased granulation in the crypt cells, crypt cell abscess, erosion of epithelial cells and disrupted lumen when compared to lean control, Chow + MC group and NAFLD only group respectively (Fig. 4A(i–iv),B). NAFLD + MC group showed non-parallel crypts, variable crypt diameters, bifurcation and branched crypts, consistent with significantly higher inflammation scores. Infiltrating leukocytes were fairly common in the disruptive villi and in the crypts of NAFLD + MC group when compared to lean, Chow + MC and NAFLD groups respectively. The results suggested that microcystin exposure in NAFLD that had consistent dysbiosis were positively associated with moderate to severe inflammatory phenotype in the intestines.

Intestinal inflammation in moderate to severe pathology associated with inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes show consistent infiltration of leukocytes and NLRP3-inflammasome activation26. To study the above-mentioned effects and their association with microcystin exposure, immunohistochemistry of stained slides were analyzed for pan macrophage marker F4/80. Results showed that NAFLD + MC group had significantly increased F4/80 immunoreactivity when compared to lean control, Chow + MC and NAFLD only groups (Fig. 5A,B) (P < 0.01). The extent of staining for F4/80 and localizations were shown by a higher magnification image (Fig. 5Av). NLRP3 inflammasome activation is a significant event in intestinal inflammation and is often associated with downstream IL1β release and pyroptosis27. To show the effect of microcystin exposure onNLRP3 inflammasome activation, immunoreactivities were analyzed for NLRP3 and ASCII. Interestingly, activation of the inflammasome is marked by their colocalization thus forming a protein complex27. Results showed that colocalization events of NLRP3 and ASCII increased significantly in NAFLD + MC group when compared to lean, Chow + MC and NAFLD groups (Fig. 6A(i–iv),B). A representative higher magnification image showing the increased colocalizations of NLRP3 and ASC II is shown in Fig. 6A-v. The above results showed that the observations were consistent with the histopathology of the affected intestines shown in Fig. 4. Interestingly the colocalizations were highly visible in the crypts that had increased granulation and abscess.

We and others have shown previously that alteration of gut dysbiosis leads to gut leaching and systemic endotoxemia28,29. The studies are also consistent with NAFLD and IBD where similar results are reported. To show that microcystin exposure in an underlying NAFLD could alter tight junction proteins claudin-2 and occluding, mice intestinal tissue slices were analyzed for immunoreactivities of the above-mentioned proteins. Results showed that the levels of claudin-2 were significantly increased in NAFLD + MC group when compared to lean control, Chow + MC and NAFLD groups (Fig. 7Ai–iv,C (P < 0.05)). Occludin levels were significantly decreased in the NAFLD + MC group when compared to lean control, Chow + MC and NAFLD groups (P < 0.05)(Fig. 7Bv–viii,D). Interestingly, microcystin exposure to lean control mice also increased claudin-2 levels significantly suggesting MC exposure can lead to altered tight junction proteins independently however the conditioned is worsened in an underlying NAFLD. We and others have shown that microbial dysbiosis leads to gut leaching and low systemic endotoxemia, a condition very much associated with intestinal inflammation29. Results showed that there was a marked increase in systemic endotoxin levels in NAFLD + MC group when compared to Chow + MC and NAFLD groups (Fig. 7E) suggesting the dysbiosis, inflammatory phenotypes and altered tight junction proteins in NAFLD + MC groups were strongly associated with systemic endotoxemia.

Oxidative stress is central to environmental exposure of toxins following their secondary metabolism and affects tissue behavior13,30,31. Interestingly we have shown before that microbiome changes can cause oxidative stress though the exact mechanism remained unclear29. Based on the strong results of an inflammatory pathology in the intestine, we chose to study the mechanisms of oxidative stress following microcystin induced dysbiosis in an underlying NAFLD intestinal tissue. Results showed that there was a significant increase inNOX-2 membrane assembly and activation as shown by the colocalization of the GP91 phox and P47 phox in the intestine when compared to lean control, Chow + MC and NAFLD groups (p < 0.05)(Fig. 8Ai–iv),
C). Tyrosine radical formation and subsequent tyrosine nitration, a marker of oxidative stress was significantly elevated in the NAFLD + MC group when compared to lean control, Chow + MC and NAFLD group respectively (P < 0.05)(Fig. 8Bv–viii,D)32. The results suggested that microcystin exposure and gut dysbiosis correlated well with increased oxidative stress primarily through intestinal NOX-2 activation and tyrosine nitration. It is worth mentioning that oxidative stress enzymes known to increase radical species such as xanthine oxidase or myeloperoxidase levels were unchanged in these treatment groups (data not shown) suggesting that NOX2-induced oxidative insult may be prime for downstream inflammatory processes and disease phenotypes or vice versa which is unexplained at this point.

To study the role of NOX-2 in the inflammatory changes in the NAFLD intestine following microcystin exposure we used mice that have the genetic deletion of the cytosolic component of NOX-2 (henceforth referred to as P47 phox knockout mice). The p47 phox KO group was treated identically as the CHOW + MC and the NAFLD + MC groups. Results showed that CHOW + MC (P47 phox KO) and NAFLD + MC (P47 phox KO) mice showed a significant decrease in colocalization of NLRP3/ASC II when compared to CHOW + MC and NAFLD + MC groups respectively (Fig. 9Ai–iv,C). Inflammasome activation is also dependent on the binding of Caspase 1 with NLRP3 to form a stable inflammasome complex33. NLRP3 and Caspase-1 colocalization events were significantly decreased in the P47 phox KO group when compared to CHOW + MC and NAFLD + MC groups suggesting a decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation (p < 0.05)(Fig. 9Bv–viii,D). Inflammasome activation is followed by a release of IL-1β for the pathway to proceed downstream26. IL1β protein levels as measured by immunohistochemistry decreased significantly in the p47 phox KO group when compared to CHOW + MC and NAFLD + MC groups suggesting that NOX-2 was required for the inflammasome activation and IL1β release in the diseased intestine (Fig. 10Ai–iv,B) (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the IL1β was localized in the same region as the NOX-2 suggesting the histopathological sites of the events are likely the same.

Results showed that use of P47 phox knockout mice for both the CHOW + MC and NAFLD + MC groups showed a significant decrease in Claudin-2 protein levels when compared to CHOW + MC and NAFLD + MC groups respectively (P < 0.05) Fig. 11Ai–iv,C). The levels of another tight junction protein Occludin increased significantly in the CHOW + MC (P47 phox KO) group when compared to CHOW + MC group, and also there was a significant increase in NAFLD + MC (P47 phox KO) group when compared to NAFLD + MC group suggesting that NOX2 was important for the alterations of these proteins crucial for maintaining gut barrier integrity (p < 0.05)(Fig. 11Bv–viii,D). P47phox KO mice also had decreased protein levels of HMGB1 (Fig. 12Ai–iv,B), a damaged associated molecular protein known to cause inflammatory pathology downstream of NLRP3 inflammasome activation when compared to Chow + MC and NAFLD + MC groups respectively (P < 0.05). Serum endotoxin levels also showed a decreased trend in p47 phox KO group when compared to CHOW + MC and NAFLD + MC groups (Fig. 12C). A representative higher magnification image of NAFLD + MC group suggests that higher HMGB1 was primarily localized in the crypt cells that showed a parallel cell damage and leukocyte infiltration (Fig. 12Ai–iv).

We and others have shown that NOX2 activation inthe intestine in an underlying NAFLD is followed by peroxynitrite generation, which subsequently acts to target various cellular signaling processes leading to inflammation32. In this study we modelled a cellular system where leptin was used to mimic a cellular NAFLD microenvironment since the disease is accompanied by leptin resistance34. This is also supported by the fact that leptin is proinflammatory and usually acts via peroxynitrite to target inflammation32. Results showed that microcystin exposure significantly increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation when compared to cell only controls (only leptin controls showed similar result) while incubation with peroxynitrite scavenger phenyl boronic acid (FBA) or NOX2 inhibitor apocynin significantly decreased the activation (Fig. 13Ai–iv,B) (P < 0.05). Release of HMGB1 was also decreased significantly in the FBA and Apocynin groups when compared to Lep + MC group (Fig. 13C) suggesting that NOX2 mediated peroxynitrite generation is crucial for NLRP3-inflammasome activation and DAMP release in these cells. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is responsible for infiltration of leukocytes at the site of tissue injury35. MCP-1 levels were significantly decreased in the epithelial cells treated with both apocynin and FBA suggesting that leukocyte infiltration was also influenced by NOX-2 mediated peroxynitrite generation (Fig. 14A) (P < 0.05).

Peroxynitrite generation requires a diffusion-controlled reaction of nitric oxide and superoxide released from NOX-2 or a subsequent enzyme capable of releasing the same36. We also showed increased nitric oxide release in cells that were incubated with leptin + microcystin. The NO release was significantly higher in the leptin + Microcystin (Leptin+MC) group when compared with either cells only group or cells incubated with leptin alone (P < 0.05) (Fig. 14B). To show that nitric oxide is crucial for the mechanisms of peroxynitrite generation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation we used a NO donor DETANONOATE37. Since extracellular ATP is one of the prime ligands for inflammasome activation, we studied the release of ATP from the intestinal epithelial cells following microcystin exposure in the presence of NO donor, NOX-2 inhibitor apocynin and peroxynitrite scavenger FBA. Results showed that extracellular ATP release was significantly increased in the presence of the NO donor and was consistent with our previous data that show leptin primed cells incubated with microcystin released NO (P < 0.05)(Fig. 15A). FBA or oxyradical scavenger and nitrone spin trap DMPO significantly decreased ATP levels, when compared to NO donor treatment group (P < 0.05) (Fig. 15A).

DETANONOATE, the NO donor significantly increased inflammasome activation (NLRP3-ASCII colocalization, Fig. 15Bi–iii,D) and recruitment of Caspase-1 in the inflammasome complex (Fig. 15Civ–vi,E)(p < 0.05) while the administration of FBA, a peroxynitrite scavenger significantly decreased the NLRP3 activation and Caspase-1 recruitment suggesting NOX2-derived superoxide and nitric oxide in the cellular microenvironment caused peroxynitrite generation and NLRP3 activation.

We report a novel mechanism of environmental low dose microcystin exposure-induced exacerbation of intestinal inflammatory pathology in an underlying NAFLD. Microcystin exposure independently altered and worsened gut dysbiosis at the phylum, order, family and genus levels. Though the altered dysbiosis bore the signature of worsened NAFLD, new information related to significant increases in the order Clostridiales, family clostridiaceae and genus blautia were observed. Interestingly, microcystin alone only increased the abundance of these bacteria marginally suggesting that an underlying asymptomatic NAFLD helped exacerbate the effect of microcystin on the digestive tract. It is important to note that increases in the abundance of Clostridiales, Clostridiaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Intestinibacter has been indicative of severe intestinal disturbances in humans38,39. Increased abundance of Clostridiaceae has been associated with increased incidences of IBD-RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis)40. Our finding of increased abundance of Clostridiales, Lachnospiraceae and the genus Intestinibacter are recognized as strong biomarkers of early onset of Chron’s disease, an intestinal inflammatory condition with no discrete therapeutic regimen41. The result reported in our study where mice with asymptomatic NAFLD were exposed to microcystin provides a strong basis that environmental exposure in patients with NAFLD carry an immense risk of progressing to a more severe phenotype of the disease. Importantly as mentioned before, NAFLD is now considered as a pandemic and is rapidly being reported not only in the developed world but encompasses more populations in the developing countries of India and China42. As more and more water bodies across the world report existence of harmful algal blooms and increased cyanobacterial abundance, it is not difficult to predict that our findings lay a strong basis for defining the risk factors in susceptible populations worldwide especially intestinal comorbidities of an existing disease43. These exacerbations can be difficult to treat and will affect health care costs tremendously. Our results, though show a strong association of microbial changes with microcystin exposure does not rule out its role as a hepatotoxic agent44. However, our data strongly suggest that microcystin exposure in low doses can influence the microbiome in parallel to its toxic effects on the liver.

Thus, in summary, our studies show a novel pathway of microcystin-induced exacerbation of NAFLD comorbidities via gut dysbiosis and redox signaling. The study also supports an emerging hypothesis that chronic microcystin exposure as might happen through drinking water contaminated with cyanobacterial toxins might aid in disease complexity and pathogenesis. The present study also can be used as a model for microcystin risk assessment in cohorts who are already plagued with asymptomatic and silent disease conditions like NAFLD and/or chronic conditions like obesity, Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension. Though the present study is conducted in a preclinical set up, future studies need to be conducted in human cohorts that associate exposure of cyanobacterial toxins and disease conditions with parallel insights to changes in gut microbiome.
