Analysis methods for the gut microbiome in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders

For a long time, the central nervous system was believed to be the only regulator of cognitive functions. However, accumulating evidence suggests that the composition of the microbiome is strongly associated with brain functions and diseases. Indeed, the gut microbiome is involved in neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g., depression, autism spectrum disorder, and anxiety) and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease). In this review, we provide an overview of the link between the gut microbiome and neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders. We also introduce analytical methods used to assess the connection between the gut microbiome and the brain. The limitations of the methods used at present are also discussed. The accurate translation of the microbiome information to brain disorder could promote better understanding of neuronal diseases and aid in finding alternative and novel therapies.

Over the past decades, a considerable amount of research has shown the gut microbiome to be associated with brain functions. Despite Hippocrates’ insightful claims, “All diseases begin in the gut,” the interaction between the gut and brain is not fully understood yet. For a long time, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases have been investigated by solely focusing on the central nervous system. However, recent groundbreaking studies have indicated that microorganisms living in the gut could influence the development of brain disorders by changing metabolites and neurochemicals [1], [2]. The chemicals produced by intestinal microorganisms can be transported across the intestinal epithelium [3]. The gut microbiome communicates with the brain via different pathways such as the neurological pathways [4], [5], endocrine pathways [6], [7], [8], and immune pathways [9], [10], [11], [12]. The vagus nerve is also a connection that transmits information about the inner organs from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain [13]. Under stress conditions, the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis responds by inducing hormone secretion, such as cortisol, through the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone. Cortisol regulates immune signaling responses, which affect the intestinal barrier [14]. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), one of the metabolites produced by bacteria, can be transported across the intestinal epithelium and reduce the gene expression related to tight junction formation in the brain microvascular endothelial cells, which makes the blood–brain barrier more permeable and could consequently regulate microglia homeostasis [12].

This interesting association between the gut microbiome and the brain has drawn researchers and encouraged them to unravel this association, particularly in terms of neurological diseases. Despite their limitations, most studies have relied on animal models to mimic the details of human diseases. Advanced analysis methods have been established to study the relationship between the gut and the brain and confirm the underlying biological mechanisms to develop treatments against brain disorders. In this review, the current state of the gut microbiome–brain research was discussed, and the evidence was summarized in favor of the involvement of the gut microbiota in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders (Fig. 1).

Various techniques for analyzing the microbiome are available. Here we discuss the basic analysis methods, the primary tools available for each method (Table 1), and previous studies about the relationship between the gut microbiome and neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric diseases.

Marker gene analysis is the most popular bioanalytical method to survey microbial populations and phylogenies. The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is globally found in bacteria. It contains a highly conserved domain and a species-dependent hypervariable sequence region [28]. Owing to these qualities, 16S rRNA can be easily targeted for amplification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers that bind to the conserved domain. 18S rRNA or internal transcribed spacers are used in fungi and yeasts as marker genes [29]. The microbial phylogeny and relative abundance of certain microbes in samples are determined from the amplified marker gene proportion [30]. Preparing the sample for cloning, sequencing the marker gene, and analyzing the resulting amplicon are tasks that are relatively inexpensive and straightforward. Well-known bioinformatics tools, such as QIIME [31], and large-scale public datasets, such as the Ribosomal Database Project [32], can be used to enhance the analysis. However, the results are subjected to PCR-related biases [33]. Indeed, biases may occur during the amplification process because the primer binding affinity for the conserved regions is not equal for the 16S rRNA component from various species. Some PCR parameters, including variable region selection, amplicon size, and the number of PCR cycles, may be further sources of biases [34]. These biases can be decreased by optimizing primers and PCR parameters [35]. After proper optimization, marker gene analysis can be applied to different research pipelines and sample types. However, the methodology only offers limited and low-resolution information about the microbial community, without microbial genome expression.

Whole genome analysis is a sequencing method that detects whole genomic contents in a sample and detects bacteria, fungi, yeasts, and viral DNAs [36]. With dramatic advances in sequencing technologies, parallel and rapid total DNA sequencing can be performed with next-generation sequencing (NGS), also known as high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Various commercial NGS platforms based on different sequencing technologies are available [37]. Additionally, shotgun sequencing allows profiling functional representations or metabolic pathways in the microbiota community [38]. In silico alignment tools have been introduced to analyze sequencing data, which consist of billions of short sequence fragments called reads [39]. Read profiling techniques provide taxonomy information and annotate genes from the sample by comparing unassembled DNA reads to reference data. Many read-based profiling tools extract all short sequences with length k from the sequencing result (k-mer) and build a de Bruijn graph to reconstruct long DNA sequences [40]. Burrows–Wheeler transform algorithm can also be used in read-based profiling [41]. Rapid and accurate mapping for entire reads are achieved by compressing large-scale genomic sequence databases with the algorithm. Another method for reading alignment consist in assembling reads into longer sequences also called contigs with the overlap-layout-consensus (ORC) algorithm. The algorithm function in three steps: 1) search overlapping sequences between the read sequences, 2) layout and assemble the overlapping reads, and 3) search for the most reliable sequences from the assembled contigs [42]. Although processes including sample preparation, whole-genome sequencing, and analysis are relatively complex and expensive, whole metagenome analysis offers detailed information about the microbial community [43].

Metagenomic analysis provides information about the microbial populations or the microbial genomic contents; however, it cannot identify transcriptionally active microbial genes or functions. In metatranscriptome analysis, a whole-genome sequencing technique is applied to conduct RNA sequencing. Microbial transcription, gene expression, and functional outputs are profiled from the sequencing data [44]. Metatranscriptome analysis allows to estimate the transcription activity and identify active metabolic pathways of species from the microbiome community [45]. However, because of the instability of RNA molecules, sample preparation, amplification, and analysis are the most expensive and complex among the microbial analyse techniques. Despite the cost, metatranscriptome analysis offers unique information to the microbiome research community.

Metabolome analysis is an emerging tool that can be used to investigate the status of the microbial community by focusing on functional dysregulation of the gut microbiome because small metabolites are the actual players of the gut–brain communication [46]. The extraction and quantification of metabolites enables the study of active metabolic pathways expressed by the gut microbiome and investigation of the interactions of these metabolites with host metabolism. Of the metabolites produced by gut microorganisms, SCFAs are the main bacterial metabolites associated with gut physiology. Of SCFAs, acetate (C1), propionate (C2), and butyrate (C3) are the most abundant ones [47]. Acetate is generally produced from acetyl-CoA, a metabolite produced via glycolysis. Propionate and butyrate are the products of metabolites produced via glycolysis or amino acid metabolism [47].

As in metabolome analysis, functional changes in the microbiome can be characterized by focusing on proteins as markers. The metaproteomic analysis pipeline consists of extracting proteins from microbiome samples, digesting the proteins into peptides, separating these peptides using LC-MS, and identifying and quantifying proteins by searching and comparing data to metagenome databases [50]. After annotating proteins from the samples using various protein databases, such as UniProt [51] or BRENDA [52], functional analysis or taxonomic assignment can be conducted. Moreover, phylogenetic or metagenomic information about the microbial community in the samples can be linked to the proteomic data for further analysis. Proteomic analysis provides information about real activities of the microbiome or allows to identify potential drug targets for certain pathways or diseases [53]. However, the sample preparation is very complex and the computational analysis is also difficult due to the large and complex proteomics datasets [54].

The gut-brain axis (GBA) consists of the biochemical signaling between the gut microbiome and the brain resulting in changes in the central nervous system state [55]. In recent years, the research focus was on the gut microbiome functions influencing the GBA bidirectional communication [6], [56], [57], [58], which is important to maintain homeostasis of the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems of animals [59], [60], [61]. It is likely that the GBA mediates various aspects of the pathogenesis of brain diseases, and intensive research is necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Various studies have shown the potential relationships between the gut microbiome and neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric diseases (Table 2).

Many studies in animal models and human patients have shown an association between the gut microbiome and the development of various neuropsychiatric disorders. Most studies reported changes in the bacterial community but lacked explaining how these changes affected brain physiology. Although many mediators, such as SCFAs, have been identified recently, the bacterial species that produce such mediators and how they influence brain functions needs further clarification.

SCZ is a psychiatric disorder characterized by positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and thought abnormalities. Patients with SCZ also exhibit negative symptoms such as anhedonia, abolition, social withdrawal, and poverty of thought [103]. SCZ is associated with dysregulation of the dopaminergic, glutamatergic, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic, and cholinergic neurotransmitters [104].

Severance et al. conducted a longitudinal, double-blind, and placebo-controlled pilot study on 56 schizophrenia subjects to explore the effects of probiotic treatment on antibodies against Candida albicans. Probiotic administration significantly reduced Candida albicans antibody levels, Candida albicans-associated gut discomfort, and positive psychiatric symptoms in male individuals [114]. Okubo et al. investigated the effects of Bifidobacterium breve A-1 administration in 29 SCZ patients with anxiety and depression symptoms. Their HADS total score and PANSS anxiety/depression score were improved and their interleukin 22 (IL-22) and tumor necrosis factor related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE) levels were increased after treatment with the probiotics [115].

ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by repetitive behaviors and impairments in social communication and cognitive functions [116], [117]. A combination of genetic and nongenetic factors contributes to ASD. Candidate genes involved in ASD etiology include genes coding for postsynaptic scaffolding proteins, contactins, neurexin family, and chromatin remodeling proteins [118]. Nongenetic factors include parental age, preterm birth, and other environmental factors [118]. Gastrointestinal symptoms and high levels of intestinal immune inflammation linked with gut dysbiosis are common in children with ASD [114], [119]. The gut microbiome of ASD patients differs from that of healthy individuals. The increased levels of Lactobacillus and Clostridium have been consistently observed in ASD patients in a few reports [95], [96], [98], [99], [100], [101]. However, controversial results were also observed for Bifidobacterium, Alistipes, Bacteroidetes, and Bacteroidetes in ASD patients [98], [99], [100].

It has been reported that the administration of bacterial metabolites, such as taurine and 5-aminovaleric acid, into an autism mouse model, enhanced ASD-like behavior [120]. Arentsen et al. investigated the effect of bacterial peptidoglycan cognitive protein (PGN) in brain development [122]. PGN2-deficient mice showed alteration in the autism risk gene c-Met and social behavior change. Lipopolysaccharides produced by Gram-negative bacteria and lipoproteins and peptidoglycan produced by Gram-positive bacteria are recognized by Toll-like receptors and then stimulate the production of cytokines. Additionally, they are transported to the brain across the blood–brain barrier and are associated with the expression of the ASD risk gene c-Met.

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impulsivity, hyperactivity, and inattention. ADHD is usually present from birth and its onset is always before the age of seven. Risk factors of developing ADHD are genetic and environmental [123], [124]. The causes of ADHD are unknown. However, the dopamine (DA) transporter gene (DAT1) and the dopamine D4 receptor gene were associated with ADHD [124]. ADHD patients showed a density of DA receptors lower than normal. Recently, the mutations A559V and R615C of DAT-1 were identified in ADHD patients, suggesting a hyperactive DA response [125].

GF mice transplanted with fecal microbiota of ADHD participants showed anxiety in the open field test and a decreased Lachnoclostridium content, which was also found in ADHD patients [132]. Pärtty et al. conducted a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in which 75 infants received Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103) or placebo during the first 6 months of life. The diagnostic of ADHD or Asperger syndrome (AS) was posed when the children were 13 years old based on the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria. Interestingly, 17.1% of the children in the placebo group were diagnosed with ADHD or AS, whereas none of the children in the probiotics group were diagnosed [133]. Kumperscak et al. investigated the effects of supplementation with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC53103). The scores obtained in the PedsQLTM Child-Self Report were significantly improved in children and adolescents with ADHD who received probiotics supplementation (n = 18) for 3 months compared with those of placebo controls (n = 14). In addition, the proinflammatory factors IL-12 p70, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were significantly decreased in the probiotics group. The proinflammatory IL-6 was significantly reduced in both groups compared with the levels 3 months before. These controversial results were suggested to be the result of the small sample size and the short observation period [134].

Depression is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by depressed mood, loss of interest, and loss of pleasure for 2 weeks or longer. It also comes with symptoms such as sleep disorder, loss or gain of weight, and diminished ability to think or concentrate [135]. Depression was associated to abnormalities in neurotransmitters like a decrease in serotonin (5-HT) transporter binding and 5-HT1A receptor binding [136].

However, another study showed no beneficial effect of probiotics supplement on depression. Romijn et al. followed seventy-nine participants who received probiotics (Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum) or placebo for 8 weeks [143]. They found no significant changes in depression severity and inflammatory markers in probiotics-supplemented depression patients.

Researchers have identified a role of the gut microbiome in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The gut microbiome also alters vulnerability to and progress of neurodegenerative diseases. In this section, we discuss the involvement of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of the neurodegenerative diseases.

AD, one of the major neurodegenerative disorders, is characterized by amyloid plaques and tau tangles. Patients with AD usually exhibit memory impairments and, less frequently, non-amnestic cognitive impairments [144]. Genetic factors, such as rare mutations, are critical risk factors in the development of AD [145].

Mice transplanted with feces from AD patients had lower levels of nervous system-related metabolites such as GABA, taurine, and valine compared with those in mice transplanted with healthy human feces. They also displayed significant cognitive impairment [147]. Chen et al. demonstrated that mice with AD-linked 5 mutations (5xFAD), a rodent model for AD, experienced gut dysbiosis in an age-dependent manner, and that antibiotic treatment improved cognitive performances and reduced amyloidogenic processes [148]. Moreover, probiotic R13 treatment reduced amyloid aggregates in the gut of 5xFAD mice and boosted the beneficial effects of bacterium L. salivarius.

PD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by movement dysfunctions. It also has a non-motor dimension that involves cognitive impairments and depression [149]. Misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein, mitochondrial dysfunction, malfunctioning protein clearance systems, including the ubiquitin–proteasome and autophagy-lysosome systems, and neuroinflammation, play vital roles in the progression and onset of PD [100]. The dark pigmented areas in the pars compacta of substantia nigra and locus coeruleus are lost in the brains of patients with PD due to the death of dopaminergic neuromelanin-containing neurons and noradrenergic neurons [100].

Higher levels of Proteus sp., Bilophila sp., and Roseburia sp. as well as loss of members of the families Lachnospiraceae, Rikenellaceae, and Peptostreptococcaceae were found in GF mice transplanted with PD patient fecal microbiota compared with the levels in GF mice transplanted with healthy control microbiota. GF mice transplanted with PD microbiota showed impairment in behavioral tests for motor dysfunction, such as the beam traversal, pole descent, and nasal adhesive removal tests [153]. The levels of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium increased in M83 transgenic mice treated with adoptive cellular therapy. It was also shown that immunotherapy outcomes had an impact on the gut microbiome of PD patients [154].

ALS is a neurodegenerative disease inducing the loss of muscle control. Several studies have been conducted to investigate the association between gut microbiota and ALS. The found a strong link between several bacterial species and ALS.

ALS presents with swallowing disturbance, muscle atrophy, alterations in metabolic activity, and weight loss due to eating problems [155]. Compared with healthy controls, the levels of SCFAs, NO2-N/NO3-N, and GABA, which are metabolites and substrates of the gut microbiome, were higher in patients with ALS [89]. Wu S et al. obtained fecal samples from ALS transgenic mice (G93A) and analyzed bacterial profiles using 16r RNA sequencing. They showed that G93A mice exhibited increased gut permeability and higher levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-17. G93A mice also showed a decrease level of in butyrate-producing bacteria (Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens) in young mice before the onset of ALS [88]. The changes in E. coli abundance and bacterial metabolites are still unclear in ALS. The abundance of identified microorganisms was often inconsistent. Thus, further in-depth research is required to determine the clear association between microbiota and ALS.

The advancement in microbiome analysis methods allowed us to understand which microorganism populations and bacterial metabolites were altered in a disease state compared with the normal state. In this review, the advantages and limitations of microbiome analysis methods and online tools for GBA discovery were summarized, such as metabolomic and metagenomic analyses. In addition, the potential relationship between alteration of the gut microbiome and brain disorders reported to date was summarized. These findings have provided researchers with a new insight into the pathophysiology of brain diseases and a new path to explore successful disease treatments based on probiotics or fecal transplantation [156].
