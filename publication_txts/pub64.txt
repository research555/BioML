Piglet gut microbial shifts early in life: causes and effects



The gut microbiome has long been known to play fundamentally important roles in the animal health and the well-being of its host. As such, the establishment and maintenance of a beneficial gut microbiota early in life is crucial in pigs, since early gut colonizers are pivotal in the establishment of permanent microbial community structures affecting the health and growth performance of pigs later in life. Emphasizing this importance of early gut colonizers, it is critical to understand the factors impacting the establishment of the piglet gut microbiome at weaning. Factors include, among others, diet, in-feed antibiotics, probiotics and prebiotic administration. The impact of these factors on establishment of the gut microbiome of piglets at weaning includes effects on piglet gut microbial diversity, structure, and succession. In this review, we thoroughly reviewed the most recent findings on the piglet gut microbiome shifts as influenced by weaning, and how these microbiome changes brought about by various factors that have been shown to affect the development of microbiota in piglets. This review will provide a general overview of recent studies that can help to facilitate the design of new strategies to modulate the gut microbiome in order to enhance gastrointestinal health, growth performance and well-being of piglets.

With the rapid transformational changes in molecular technologies and the development of “omics” strategies, the pig gastrointestinal (gut) microbiota has been intensively studied [1] and it is widely known to perform fundamentally important roles in health and well-being of animals [2, 3]. The gut microbiota provides the pig with many functions including improved energy harvesting capacity, the production of volatile fatty acids, production of vitamin K, cellulose fermentation, and enhanced resistance against pathogenic bacteria [1, 3, 4]. As this field of study continues to expand, it is clear that new roles and relationships between the gut microbiome and growth performance of the animal are yet to be discovered.

In this review, we will discuss the most relevant findings of recent microbiome studies focusing on the analysis of the early-life pig gut microbiome as influenced by various factors, including diet, probiotics supplementation, and in-feed antibiotics, all of which have been shown to affect the development of microbiota in weanling pigs. Knowledge described in this review will facilitate in the development of new feeding strategies to assist in the establishment and maintenance of a beneficial gut microbiota of the piglets early in life. Here we provide a general overview of the recent studies about the intestinal microbiome of piglets at weaning.

In pig production, weaning is an abrupt separation of pigs from the sow and it is characterized by stressful changes that can contribute to intestinal and immune dysfunctions leading to decreased piglet health and growth performance [10]. While weaning practices varies among swine producers, weaning age on commercial pig farms has been decreasing steadily with age less than 21 days. Generally, piglets are exposed to a number of stressors during the weaning transition, with among the most important being the abrupt change in diet from milk to plant-based solid feed. Weaning causes physiological changes in the structure and function of the intestine [11]. Moreover, the gut microbiota of young piglets undergoes a very quick ecological succession upon induction of various factors during the weaning period. Changes to the composition of resident commensal bacteria during the transitional periods in the piglet is referred to as a microbial shift [1]. This certainly occurs during weaning in piglets. One of the major factors influencing shifts in the microbiota in piglets during weaning is the abrupt change in diet from simple to more complex nutrient sources, which may affect absorption capacity of the small intestine, and likely influences growth and feed efficiency. The weaning period is critical as piglets are exposed to thousands of new bacterial species, which may play substantial roles in establishing an adult-like microbiota later in life [12]. Early-life microbial exposure is of particular importance to growth, development of immune system and health [13]. In addition, the establishment of a beneficial microbiota is important during the weaning stage because piglets still have an immature immune system and they are dependent on sow’s milk to prevent colonization and overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens [14]. Therefore, it is necessary to better understand the gut microbial succession during the weaning transition, and how diverse factors influence piglet gut microbial shifts in association with the enhance gastrointestinal health, growth performance and well-being of piglets [15].

In the recent years, several studies have explored the possible links between the intestinal microbiota composition of piglets and its association with growth performance and health, with research focus on the major factors thought to shape the piglet gut microbiota (diet, antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics) [3, 16]. Below, we will discuss the relative importance of the factors affecting the intestinal microbiota in piglets early in life and its implication for swine nutritional strategies to improve health and performance of pigs.

The weaning period is a crucial stage in the life of pigs, as the gut microbial composition and the immune system are still developing, making the pigs susceptible to pathogens leading to post-weaning diarrhea [15]. Diarrhea has been the leading and increasing cause of mortality in the swine industry. Interestingly, there is an increasing evidence in recent years suggesting the gut microbiota contributes in the development of diarrhea in weaned piglets, not just specific pathogens [13]. It has been recognized that gut microbiota provides protection against pathogens by regulating the immune response of the host. For example, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) or Candidatus Arthromitus, which are known modulators of the mammalian immune system, have been identified as a major group of bacteria in the terminal ileum of weaning piglets [17, 18]. However, there is limited information on the early-life microbial community structure and function of the gut microbiota and its role in pathogenesis of post-weaning diarrhea in pigs. A recent metagenomic analysis of the fecal microbiota in diarrheic piglets has revealed that diarrhea was associated with increase in the relative abundance of Prevotella, Sutterella, Campylobacter and Fusobacteriaceae [19]. Another report assessed the potential early gut microbiota composition of piglets as an indicator of susceptibility to post-weaning diarrhea [13]. In that study, piglets were weaned in poor housing conditions to challenge their susceptibility to diarrhea. When compared to diarrheic piglets, the gut microbiota of healthy piglets had higher abundance of Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae [13]. Results from these studies suggest that the gut microbial composition could be used as a biomarker to predict health status of piglets. However, further work is necessary to understand the mechanisms of action of the gut microbial community in protection, and the development of clinical interventions for better gut health of the piglets.

Importantly, during the weaning transition piglets experience an immediate but transient drop in feed intake or anorexia, which contributes to intestinal inflammation [20, 21]. In a recent study, the mechanisms by which the gut inflammation contributes to imbalance of the microbiota has been proposed [22]. Under intestinal inflammatory conditions, host response results in production of reactive oxygen species such as nitric oxide (NO) that is rapidly converted to nitrate (NO3−) when released in the intestinal lumen [15, 22, 23]. The nitrate-rich environment is conducive for the growth of Enterobacteriaceae that encodes for nitrate reductase genes [23, 24]. Of note, some pathogens within the family Enterobacteriaceae, namely Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), induce intestinal inflammation in pigs which disrupts the microbiome composition [25, 26]. For example, in a piglet model of Salmonella Typhimurium infection, Arguello et al. [27] observed that there was a decrease in the population of desirable bacteria such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus with an increase in pathogenic bacteria, Citrobacter and a depletion in anaerobic bacteria namely Clostridium, Ruminococcus or Diallister at the ileum mucosa of weaned piglets. Therefore, intestinal inflammation associated with weaning initiates disturbances in the gut microbiota, which favors the growth of enteropathogenic bacteria especially Enterobacteriaceae. However, further research is warranted to understand the impact of intestinal inflammation on gut microbiota disruptions in the post-weaning piglets.

Host genetics has been considered a major factor shaping the intestinal microbiota of mice and humans [28, 29]. Previously, the work of Ochman et al. [30] revealed that host genetics was the dominant factor that influenced the distal gut microbial communities within the primate gut over evolutionary timescales. The gut microbial composition of pigs is likely also shaped by host genetics. Several studies have reported the impact of host genetics on the development of gut microbiota in piglets at the early stages of life. Recently, a study by Pajarillo et al. [9] demonstrated an interaction between the fecal microbial community and pig breed using pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. This study was conducted to investigate the differences and similarities in fecal microbial communities among the three purebred pig lines (Duroc, Landrace and Yorkshire), and to discover possible links between microbiota and host genetics. At the phylum level, majority of the sequences were classified as the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes regardless of the pig breed which is congruent with previous studies. However, the proportion of bacteria belonging to phylum Firmicutes was more abundant in Landrace pigs than in Duroc and Yorkshire pigs [9]. At the genus level, Prevotella, Blautia, Oscillibacter, and Clostridium were identified in all fecal samples regardless of the pig breed. In addition, Catenibacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, and Subdoligranulum were more abundant in Duroc pigs, while Dialister was more abundant in Yorkshire pigs. It was suggested that the microbiome of Yorkshire and Landrace pigs were similar but distinct to that of Duroc pigs, and that this may be due to gene pool similarities between Yorkshire and Landrace pigs. Therefore, the differences in the composition of the gut microbiota of pigs may be attributed to host genetics since all pigs were raised under the same controlled environment and fed with similar diets. However, the authors suggested that other environmental factors, such as pen and seasonal effects must also be considered to link differences in gut microbiota with host genetics [9].

These results demonstrate that host genetics can be characterized as a major internal factor that shapes the intestinal microbiota of piglets, which is evident in early life of pigs. Nevertheless, further research is needed to fully decipher the impact of host genetics on the early colonization and development of gut microbiota of piglets and its subsequent impact on growth, health and performance.

The first year of life is important in establishing the gut microbiota of animals and it is strongly affected by diet [39]. Several studies reported effects of dietary change on the piglet gut microbiome, overall health, and growth performance. Frese et al. [39] used 16S rRNA gene and whole metagenome sequencing (WMS) to characterize the fecal microbiomes of piglets from birth to 7 weeks of age. In this study, they evaluated the effects of dietary change from sow’s milk to a plant-based starter diet on pig gut microbial structure, function, and ecological succession. Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of piglet gut microbial alpha diversity and the changes in microbial taxa at the family level from birth through weaning, as influenced by diet. Alpha diversity of microbiota is a measure of within-sample diversity. It can be concluded that there was a precise difference in alpha diversity of piglet gut microbiota before and after weaning in piglets. Alpha diversity of the piglet gut microbiota increased concurrently with the dietary change from sow’s milk to plant based starter diet. At the family level, relative abundances of Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae declined over time while those of Lactobacillaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Veillonellaceae, and Prevotellaceae increased in weaned piglets. These observations are in agreement with previous dietary studies investigating differences in animal and plant-based diets [6, 12].

Overall, these studies and many other studies [48–52] suggest that gut microbiota can be modulated by various dietary components such as dietary fiber, dietary protein, and minerals. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved in the interactions between diet composition and the piglet gut microbiota.

The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) define probiotics as live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefits on the host [53]. Probiotics are one of the functional foods that link diet and health. In 2007, Roberfroid defined a prebiotic as “a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confer benefits upon host well-being and health” [54]. Over the past few decades, probiotics and prebiotics or their combination (also known as synbiotics) have been the subject of many research studies because of their potential therapeutic and preventive health benefits to animals [55]. Previous reports have shown that probiotics and prebiotics have a broad range of beneficial effects in pigs including fortification of the intestinal barrier function [56, 57], reduction of diarrhea duration and severity [28–30], inhibition of pathogenic bacteria [58], and immunological development [57, 59].

Many studies suggested that probiotics, prebiotics and their synbiotic combination exerted beneficial effects on piglets through the modulation of gut microbiota. However, there is a need to clarify the underlying mechanisms of probiotic supplementation on the intestinal microbial composition because other studies reported no effect of probiotic supplementation on the gut microbial communities [63].

For the past six decades, antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) have been used to promote piglet growth starting at weaning. AGPs, unlike therapeutic applications of antimicrobials, are provided to pigs continuously at much lower dosages resulting in enhanced pig production. When AGPs are first administered to piglets early in life, their microbiomes are composed of bacteria that are more vulnerable to changes. Thus it was speculated that administration of AGPs could enhance growth performance of piglets by modulating the gut microbiome [64]. AGPs such as tylosin, bacitracin, virginiamycin, and chlortetracycline have been used in piglets to promote growth performance through increased feed conversion and weight gain that leads to healthier animals [64]. However, there are increasing concerns related to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains and antibiotic residues in meat products and animal feces [65, 66]. Moreover, the potential adverse impact of these antibiotic resistance genes to human health has been increasing. Consequently, the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in swine has been banned in many developed countries including those of the European Union (EU), the USA, and Canada. While the mechanisms by which antibiotics enhance the growth of livestock animals are unclear, many studies have proposed that growth promotion of livestock animals was due in part to the alteration of their gut microbiota [67]. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of antibiotics on the pig gut microbiota [64, 68]. In addition, piglets are frequently exposed to antibiotics early in life primarily to prevent outbreaks of intestinal and respiratory diseases, thus it is important to understand how antibiotics affect the intestinal microbiota.

These studies demonstrate how antibiotics may shape the intestinal microbiota of pigs in early life, and strongly suggest a link between antibiotic supplementation and gut microbiota dysbiosis in early life of pigs. In summary, recent published research data clearly showed that subtherapeutic use of antibiotics in pig production improves growth rate, reduces morbidity and mortality and improves the overall health in pigs. However, subtherapeutic use of antibiotic growth promoters raises concerns such as microbial dysbiosis that can have long-lasting effects. Moreover, antibiotics used in the swine production can contribute in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in the environment and antibiotic residues in the human food chain which may bring potential impacts on human health. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which antibiotic-induced microbial dysbiosis influences growth of the animal needs further research for the development of antibiotic alternatives that mimic these changes.

The advent of modern molecular techniques has profoundly expanded our knowledge of the swine gut microbiota. In the recent years, amplification of the 16S rRNA gene coupled with next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled us to intensively explore the gut microbial composition of pigs [1]. While 16S rRNA gene sequencing uncovers the complex taxonomic profile of a microbial community, it is also important to understand the functional capacities of the early-life piglet gut microbiota and its potential contributions to the physiology and metabolism in the pig’s GIT. This can now be accomplished predictively through whole-metagenome sequencing. [40].

The advancement of metagenomic methods have leveraged our current understanding of the dynamics of the pig gut microbiome through WMS in association with abrupt dietary change and the potential contribution of the microbiome in shaping the piglet health and growth performance. Characterization of both microbial structure and functional capacities of the piglet gut microbiome in early-life could reveal potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for prevention of post-weaning infections and eventually improvement in health and growth performance.

The intestinal microbiota is known to play major roles in the development of immune system and the overall health of piglets. The composition and diversity of the piglet gut microbiota during the early stages of life are not fixed, and are affected by various factors including diet and use of antibiotics and probiotics. Weaning and/or the change to consumption of solid feed marks an important and remarkably mosaic period of microbial shifts within the pig gut. Irrespective of weaning, piglet gut bacterial diversity increases, while variability caused by idiosyncratic effects is reduced, as piglets age. Findings from these studies should facilitate the development of evidence-based strategies to assist in the establishment of healthy gut microbiota of piglets during early stages of life, and to maintain beneficial microbes that are important to enhance the gastrointestinal health of piglets. Nevertheless, there is still an overall paucity of knowledge about the piglet gut microbiota during the weaning transition. There is an eminent need to explore which bacterial species are really beneficial to piglets because we do not fully understand the functional roles of each species in pigs. It is worth noting that the work performed thus far is mainly descriptive, and studies are greatly needed that employ metagenomics, metabolomics, and metatranscriptomics based approaches, at the same time testing specific hypotheses related to mechanism and function. Such studies will help to further elucidate the role of the piglet gut microbiome in overall health and development.
