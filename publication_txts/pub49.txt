Dietary Patterns Affect the Gut Microbiome—The Link to Risk of Cardiometabolic Diseases

Clusters of bacterial species within the gut microenvironment, or gut enterotype, have been correlated with cardiometabolic disease risk. The metabolic products and metabolites that bacteria produce, such as short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, and trimethylamine, may also affect the microbial community and disease risk. Diet has a direct impact on the gut microenvironment by providing substrates to and promoting the colonization of resident bacteria. To date, few dietary patterns have been evaluated for their effect on the gut microbiome, but the Mediterranean diet and Vegetarian diets have shown favorable effects for both the gut microbiome and cardiometabolic disease risk. This review examines the gut microbiome as a mediator between these dietary patterns and cardiometabolic disease risk.

The gut microbiome (GM) plays a central role in health (1,2). Disruption of the GM, or gut dysbiosis, is associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases, such as metabolic syndrome (MetS), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (3–5). Numerous studies have reported correlations between gut bacteria and CVD risk (4,6–11) and despite the relation between the GM and cardiometabolic disease being of great scientific interest, this area of research is in its infancy, and there are many questions that await answers. At present it is proposed that specific bacterial metabolites produced in the GM vary depending on the hosts’ gut microbial environment (12), which is influenced by many factors including age, genetics, cohabitation, medication, and diet (13–15). The metabolites produced via the microbiota are also affected by diet. Therefore, the combination of foods and nutrients consumed may change the composition and functionality of the GM. Thus, the role that the GM plays in nutrient metabolism and production of primary and secondary metabolites is likely to mediate the relation between diet and cardiometabolic disease risk (12,16–18). The objective of this review is to summarize recent evidence about how dietary patterns affect the GM and, in turn, how the GM affects cardiometabolic disease risk.

To date, few dietary patterns have been evaluated for their effect on the GM, although several studies have examined the GM in relation to the Mediterranean diet and Vegetarian diets (22,51,52). Notably, these dietary patterns are also associated with lower CVD risk (53,54). Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the GM may be an important mediator between these dietary patterns and cardiometabolic disease risk. Because studies of the effect of dietary patterns on the GM and CVD risk have predominantly investigated Mediterranean and Vegetarian diets, this review will focus on these dietary patterns.

A large body of evidence has demonstrated the cardiovascular benefits of following a Vegetarian diet (55–58), including lacto-ovo-vegetarian, lacto-vegetarian, ovo-vegetarian, and vegan diets, and it is plausible that the GM plays a role in the observed effects because the many plant-based constituents (including dietary fiber) of a Vegetarian diet provide substrates to microbes in the lower gastrointestinal tract.

In summary, the GM may be an important mediator in the reduced cardiometabolic disease risk associated with a Vegetarian diet, but more studies are needed to understand the mechanism. A plant-based diet can favorably affect the GM through changes in bacteria, such as increases inPrevotella taxa, and reduction of harmful metabolites, such as TMA, but the effect on gut enterotype and SCFA production requires further study. The key question that follows is mechanistically how changes in the GM modulate risk factors for cardiometabolic disease.

Prominent components of the Mediterranean diet include fruits, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, nuts, seafood, and wine. Evidence demonstrates that this eating pattern is associated with a lower risk of CVD and that adherence to a Mediterranean diet can affect gut microbial patterns and the fecal metabolic profile of microbial-derived phenolics (51,68–70). Thus, the GM may partly mediate the relation observed between the Mediterranean diet and reduced risk of CVD.

The dietary pattern consumed affects the composition of the GM through the provision of substrate for the gut microbes. Various bacteria prefer different energy sources and the type of foods consumed promotes the residency of bacteria that favor the energy substrate provided. This results in gut-derived metabolic products that can alter the structure and function of the GM and affect disease risk. Moreover, changes in GM that have emerged with adherence to a Mediterranean diet suggest it may provide important dietary components that can improve GM functionality with consequent benefits on the host. Future research is needed to further investigate how the Mediterranean diet affects gut enterotype. The present evidence to date suggests that the Mediterranean diet increases SCFA production, metabolites that have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiometabolic diseases.

Vegetarian and Mediterranean diets both reduce cardiometabolic risk and favorably change the GM. Current knowledge suggests that consumption of a Vegetarian or Mediterranean diet generates favorable shifts in the microbes in the lower gastrointestinal tract and beneficial gut-derived metabolites may be a product of these alterations. The temporality of this relation is not well understood and it may be bidirectional. The composition of the GM affects the gut-derived metabolic products and these metabolites may also affect the microbial community and gut enterotype. Examination of the gut enterotype, microbial functionality, and gut-derived metabolites could provide a better understanding of the changes that occur with specific dietary patterns. The entire gut environment, including present microbes, relative abundance of microbes, microbial gene expression, and microbial metabolites, is important to consider relative to the link between the GM and disease risk. However, the majority of evidence to support the correlations between these diets and changes in the GM composition and metabolites is primarily derived from epidemiologic research. Further research is needed to increase our understanding of how dietary patterns alter the GM and, importantly, how alterations in the GM mechanistically modulate risk of cardiometabolic diseases.
