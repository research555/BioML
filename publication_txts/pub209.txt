Characteristics of the gut microbiome profile in obese patients with colorectal cancer

Obesity affects the gut microbiome, which in turn increases the risk for colorectal cancer. Several studies have shown the mechanisms by which some bacteria may influence the development of colorectal cancer; however, gut microbiome characteristics in obese patients with colorectal cancer remain unclear. Therefore, this study evaluated their gut microbiome profile and its relationship with metabolic markers.

The study assessed fecal samples from 36 consecutive patients with colorectal cancer and 38 controls without colorectal cancer. To identify microbiotic variations between patients with colorectal cancer and controls, as well as between nonobese and obese individuals, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed.

Principal coordinate analysis showed significant differences in the overall structure of the microbiome among the study groups. The α‐diversity, assessed by the Chao1 index or Shannon index, was higher in patients with colorectal cancer versus controls. The relative abundance of the genera Enterococcus, Capnocytophaga, and Polaribacter was significantly altered in obese patients with colorectal cancer, whose serum low‐density lipoprotein concentrations were positively correlated with the abundance of the genus Enterococcus; among the most abundant species was Enterococcus faecalis, observed at lower levels in obese versus nonobese patients.

This study demonstrated several compositional alterations of the gut microbiome in patients with colorectal cancer and showed that a reduced presence of E. faecalis may be associated with obesity‐related colorectal cancer development. The gut microbiome may provide novel insights into the potential mechanisms in obesity‐related colorectal carcinogenesis.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death, estimated at 881 000 deaths globally in 2018, accounting for about 1 in 10 cancer deaths. 1 The average risk of developing colon cancer before 75 years of age is estimated to be 31%. 2 Evidence is sufficient for a causal relationship between the risk of CRC and excess body weight or obesity, which is thought to be one of the attributes of the global burden of cancer. 3 The underlying mechanisms linking obesity to CRC remain a matter of debate; however, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and alterations in adipocytokine concentrations appear to be of great importance. 4 The authors of this study previously demonstrated that visceral fat obesity and metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance following hyperinsulinemia, 5 impaired secretion of adipocytokine 6 , 7 , 8 or incretin, 9 , 10 and systemic low chronic inflammation 11 , 12 contribute to the development of CRC or colorectal adenoma, which is a well‐known precancerous lesion of CRC.

These findings seem to provide new opportunities to take advantage of the existing knowledge of the gut microbiome for the pathogenesis of obesity‐related CRC development. However, the characteristics of the microbiome in obese patients with CRC remain vastly underexplored. Therefore, this study evaluated the gut microbiome profile and its relationship with metabolic markers in obese patients with CRC.

From June 2018 to July 2019, fecal samples were obtained from 36 consecutive patients with CRC at Yamagata University Hospital, Yamagata, Japan, and 38 individuals without CRC (controls) as confirmed on total colonoscopy as part of the health checkup conducted at Tohoku Central Hospital, Yamagata. The control participants in the present study were asymptomatic adults who underwent health checkups; they were not patients who visited the hospital. No obvious gastrointestinal abnormalities were found in the results of the health checkups, including colonoscopy. Exclusion criteria included a history of bowel resection, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome for both groups and a history or diagnosis of malignant neoplasm in the controls. None of the participants were taking antibiotics or acid‐suppressing drugs or were undergoing antiobesity treatment.

Methods for obtaining clinical data, colonoscopy, and stool collection are described in the Supporting information.

Fecal DNA was isolated using the KingFisher Duo Prime Purification System with MagMAX CORE Nucleic Acid Purification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Approximately 120 μL of the stored fecal sample was mixed with one volume of sterilized phosphate‐buffered salts; the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 100g for 1 min and then incubated at 55°C for 30 min after mixing with both 10 μL of proteinase K and its buffer. The mixture was centrifuged at 15000g for 2 min; then, the supernatant was collected. The subsequent extraction procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The yield and quality of the extracted DNA were evaluated with the Qubit HS assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed for the purified DNA samples using two primer pools corresponding to the V2, V4, and V8 regions (size of amplicon was 250 base pairs [bp], 288 bp, and 295 bp, respectively) or V3, V6–7, and V9 regions (sizes of amplicon were 215 bp, 260 bp, and 209 bp, respectively) of the 16S rRNA (16S metagenomics kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). According to the procedure manual of the Ion AmpliSeq library kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), adapter sequences were added to the PCR products to obtain sequence libraries. To ensure the quality and size of each library, digital electrophoresis using a D1000 ScreenTape on a 2200 Tape Station (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was performed. Amplified 30–140 pM libraries were submitted to emulsion PCR. After purification using biotin‐coated beads, the PCR products were loaded onto an Ion P1 chip v3. Ion semiconductor sequencing was performed using Ion Proton (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To obtain taxonomy assignment, >101 bp read lengths in sequence files were run through the assembly programs constructed with Bowtie2 version 2.3.5 program along with consecutive mapping on Greengenes database (published May 2011, including 16Sr RNA gene sequence information of 406 998 strains). The read depths against the 16S rRNA gene regions were calculated by using the bedtools software version 2.29.0. To optimize mapping, microbiome data were used that could confirm multiple reads in ±3 bp over the size of amplicon against the V1–V9 regions using the In House R script.

Continuous variables and categorical variables were analyzed using the two‐tailed Wilcoxon test and the Fisher exact test, respectively. Multiple comparisons were performed using the Kruskal–Wallis test to compare continuous variables following a post‐hoc Steel–Dwass test. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical calculations were conducted using JMP 14 (SAS Institute) and R programming language software, version 3.6.1.

In the patients with CRC (n = 36), the number of current smokers and those with diabetes or hyperlipidemia; median age; concentrations of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR) were significantly higher, whereas body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol (TC), and high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations were significantly lower versus controls (n = 38, Table S1, Supporting information). No significant differences were observed between patients with CRC and controls for the proportion of participants who were male, obese, or a current drinker or for triglyceride (TG) concentrations. In the controls, the proportion of males, FPI and TG concentrations, and HOMA‐IR were significantly higher, whereas HDL concentration was lower in obese (n = 17) versus nonobese participants (n = 21, Table S2). In patients with CRC, no significant differences were noted in clinical characteristics and CRC stages between obese (n = 9) and nonobese (n = 27) participants. In obese participants, mean age, the proportion of diabetes and hyperlipidemia, and FPG concentrations were higher, whereas TC and LDL concentrations were lower in patients with CRC versus controls.

Principal coordinates analysis demonstrated a significant difference in the overall microbiota structure between patients with CRC and controls (Fig.
1a) or between obese and nonobese participants in each group (Fig.
1b,c) or between obese patients with CRC and obese controls (Fig.
1d). The median Shannon index, which estimated both operational taxonomic unit (OTU) evenness and richness, tended to be higher in patients with CRC (Fig.
2a, Table S3). No significant intergroup differences in the Shannon index were observed between nonobese and obese controls or patients with CRC (Fig.
2b). The median Chao1 index, which estimated OTU richness, was significantly higher in patients with CRC versus controls (Fig.
2c). In either nonobese or obese participants, the median Chao1 index tended to be higher in patients with CRC versus controls (Fig.
2d).

The relative abundance rates (Tables S4,S5) of the phyla Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Tenericutes were significantly higher in patients with CRC versus controls (Fig. 3a,b). Relative abundance rates of 38 genera were significantly higher, whereas those of 9 genera were significantly lower in patients with CRC versus controls (Fig.
4, Table S6). In patients with CRC, comparison of these genera between obese and nonobese participants revealed that the relative abundance of the genus Enterococcus was significantly lower in obese patients, whereas the relative abundance of the genera Capnocytophaga and Polaribacter were significantly higher in obese patients with CRC (Fig.
5a–c, Table S7). In controls, no significant differences were observed in the relative abundance of Enterococcus and Capnocytophaga between obese and nonobese participants (Fig.
5d,e). The genus Polaribacter was observed in none of the controls nor in seven patients (19.4%) with CRC.

For Enterococcus, Capnocytophaga, and Polaribacter, the relative abundance of which was significantly altered in obese patients with CRC, their correlation with metabolic factors was evaluated. The relative abundance of the genus Enterococcus positively correlated with LDL concentrations in patients with CRC (Fig.
6a, Table S8), particularly in obese patients (Fig.
6b).

The most abundant species in the genus Enterococcus was E. faecalis, which was significantly lower in obese versus nonobese patients with CRC (Fig.
7a). In controls, the relative abundance of E. faecalis was higher in obese versus nonobese participants. The relative abundance of E. faecalis against all microbiome components in the present study was significantly lower in obese versus nonobese patients with CRC (Fig.
7b); in contrast, no significant difference was observed in those components between obese and nonobese controls. Furthermore, no significant differences were found in the relative abundance of E. faecalis among the CRC stages (Fig. S1) and participant ages (Fig. S2), although patients with CRC were significantly older than controls. No significant differences were noted in the relative abundance of the other identified Enterococcus species between obese and nonobese patients with CRC.

In the present study, the gut microbiome compositions were altered between obese and nonobese participants both in the controls and in patients with CRC. Increased diversity of the gut microbiome was observed in patients with CRC. The relative abundance of the genera Enterococcus, Capnocytophaga, and Polaribacter was significantly altered in obese patients with CRC. Furthermore, these results were the first to demonstrate the correlation between serum LDL concentrations and the relative abundance of the genus Enterococcus and that E. faecalis was significantly reduced in obese patients with CRC. Thus, the present study is the first to describe the association of E. faecalis in obesity‐related CRC development.

In conclusion, this study described several compositional alterations, including the genera Enterococcus, Polaribacter, and Capnocytophaga, in obese patients with CRC in whom E. faecalis was reduced. Thus, E. faecalis may be an active participant in the development of obesity‐related CRC. Understanding how the gut microbiome communicates the link between obesity and colorectal carcinogenesis may provide an opportunity to better describe the mechanistic insights into obesity‐related colorectal carcinogenesis and to identify potential significant implications for therapeutic strategies for CRC.
