Medicinal Plants and Their Impact on the Gut Microbiome in Mental Health: A Systematic Review

Background: Various neurocognitive and mental health-related conditions have been associated with the gut microbiome, implicating a microbiome–gut–brain axis (MGBA). The aim of this systematic review was to identify, categorize, and review clinical evidence supporting medicinal plants for the treatment of mental disorders and studies on their interactions with the gut microbiota. Methods: This review included medicinal plants for which clinical studies on depression, sleeping disorders, anxiety, or cognitive dysfunction as well as scientific evidence of interaction with the gut microbiome were available. The studies were reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Results: Eighty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and covered thirty mental health-related medicinal plants with data on interaction with the gut microbiome. Conclusion: Only a few studies have been specifically designed to assess how herbal preparations affect MGBA-related targets or pathways. However, many studies provide hints of a possible interaction with the MGBA, such as an increased abundance of health-beneficial microorganisms, anti-inflammatory effects, or MGBA-related pathway effects by gut microbial metabolites. Data for Panax ginseng, Schisandra chinensis, and Salvia rosmarinus indicate that the interaction of their constituents with the gut microbiota could mediate mental health benefits. Studies specifically assessing the effects on MGBA-related pathways are still required for most medicinal plants.

Stress, anxiety, mood disorders, sleep problems, and cognitive dysfunction are the most common mental health problems for which herbal products constitute a reasonable treatment option with minor side effects and low toxicity [1,2]. The pathogenesis of mental disorders is complex and generally thought to be linked to genetic, immune-related, humoral, neural, and environmental factors. However, various neurocognitive and mental health conditions have been strongly associated with imbalances in the gut microbiome composition, referred to as dysbiosis [3].

It is important to consider the symbiotic relationship between humans and their resident microbes when discussing the role of the gut–brain axis in behavior, health, and disease [4]. The sharp increase in various disease states in recent decades [5,6] could be explained, at least in part, by the changes in modern diets and lifestyles that have negatively impacted the composition and diversity of the human gut microbiome [7]. The gut microbiome could be the missing link in the conceptualization and treatment of psychological disorders [4]. The microbiome–gut–brain axis (MGBA) provides a network for signals from the brain to influence the motor, sensory, and secretory functions of the gut while simultaneously allowing signals and metabolites from the gut microbiome to influence brain development, biochemistry, function, and behavior [8,9,10].

Finally, the immune system is a mediator in maintaining a dynamic equilibrium between the brain and the gut. Direct interaction has been reported between the immune system and the HPA axis, afferent nervous system, and ENS [34]. Host–microbiota interactions can result in modulation of immune homeostasis, which can alter brain function via the HPA axis [36,37]. The gut microbiome is thought to influence the metabolism of inflammatory mediators, e.g., the release of cytokines (interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-4) and interferon gamma during dysbiosis [16]. Moreover, the gut microbiota maintains the homeostasis of microglia, which are the innate immune cells of the CNS [13,25].

Subjects with depression, anxiety, and mood disorders show distinct compositional changes in their gut bacteria profile, raising the question about a possible etiological role of the microbiome in these disorders [38]. Differences in the gut microbial community composition have been observed in patients with mental health conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism [11,39]. Alterations in gut microbial profiles have been observed in various preclinical models of brain disorders and can, at least partially, be translated to humans. Recent animal studies have shown that fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs) can transfer behavioral types and emotional states. For example, FMT from depressed patients into germ-free mice has been associated with apparent depressive-like symptoms in the receiving animals [40]. Gut microbiota diversity reduction has been linked to a significant decrease in BDNF, vasopressin, and oxytocin expression in the brain, resulting in behavioral changes in adolescent mice [12]. The mechanisms by which an altered gut microbiome acts on brain development and function are summarized in Figure 1b [12,17,19].

Depression is a multifactorial disorder that involves various pathophysiological conditions [27]. Four major hallmarks of the pathophysiology of major depressive disorders (MDDs) are central dopamine levels, inflammation, stress responses via the HPA axis and the autonomic nervous system, and dysfunction of BDNF [41]. MDD is considered, in some sense, to be a chronic inflammatory disease with altered levels of serum cytokines [42,43]. One animal study showed an association between MDD and several inflammatory pathways, including the nuclear factor κβ (NF-κβ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and Toll-like receptor pathways [42]. Chronic stress is associated with extensive gut permeability (leaky gut), leading to neural inflammation via Toll-like receptor-4 [41]. Moreover, in a mouse study, the gut microbiota was found to affect BBB permeability by regulating the expression of the tight junction proteins (TJPs) occludin and claudin-5 in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and striatum. Enhanced BBB permeability allows inflammatory mediators to enter the brain, leading to neural inflammation [41]. On the other hand, depression is associated with reduced levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline, with altered tryptophan metabolism and BDNF levels [14,27,41].

Alterations in behavior have been observed in experimental animals given certain probiotic bacterial strains [44,45,46]. In addition, human studies have shown the potential translatability of these findings [32,47].

The aim of this review was to assess the available scientific literature for potential links between the efficacy of medicinal plants used for mental health conditions and their interaction with gut microbiota. For this purpose, we scrutinized published data from clinical studies of medicinal plants for mental disorders and from studies assessing the interaction of these plants with gut microbiota.

This systematic review is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (Figure 2) to ensure a standardized reporting quality [60].

Inclusion and exclusion criteria of studies were as follows: Medicinal plants were included in the systematic survey if there was clinical evidence for effects on depression, sleep, anxiety, mood, or cognitive dysfunction and there were studies available (in vitro studies, in vivo studies involving humans and animals except for ruminants and birds) that evaluated an interaction of these medicinal plants and gut microbiota. Only studies performed with the listed plant parts or extracts were considered relevant. No studies on combinations of herbal extracts were included. In the literature survey in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 we also excluded published data on pure compounds occurring as main constituents in these extracts but mention them in the discussion of the results when relevant. Studies concerning neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s were excluded because the neurodegenerative nature of these diseases places them in a separate category.

Data were successively gathered from the PubMed/Medline and Embase databases (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc; https://www.embase.com; last accessed: 5 January 2021). The reference lists of all retrieved review articles were also checked for additional related articles. For the first aim of retrieving all studies dealing with the effects of medicinal plants on mental health, the following search strategy, steps, and general keywords were used in PubMed: ((medicinal plant *) AND ((antidepressant) OR (mental stress) OR (mood disorder *) OR (insomnia) OR (sleep) OR (anxiety) OR (cognitive impairment *) OR (circadian clock) OR (circadian rhythm) OR (dementia) OR (memory) OR (adaptogen *) OR (focus and attention) OR (fatigue)) NOT ((Alzheimer’s disease *) NOT (Parkinson’s disease *)). In the second step, the focus was on clinical effects of the mental health-related medicinal plants identified from the studies retrieved in the first step. Their botanical plant names were specifically searched in PubMed using the following search string: (plant name OR plant name OR ……) AND (clinical study) AND (anxiety) OR (insomnia) OR (antidepressant) OR (cognitive impairment *) OR (fatigue) OR (memory)).

In the last step, the medicinal plants with reported clinical mental health effects and that were also evaluated in studies of the gut microbiome were selected.. The search strategy is shown in the PRISMA flowchart in Figure 2. The searched data were transferred to the Citavi literature management program.

The titles of all retrieved papers were examined, and studies inconsistent with the objectives of this systematic review were excluded. In the next step, the abstracts of the remaining studies were examined, and again, incompatible studies not meeting the inclusion criteria (see Section 2.1) were excluded. Then, data were extracted from the full texts of the compatible studies and tabulated using standardized information, such as botanical names, medicinal plant parts used, common or local name(s), main constituents, and the field in which the clinical studies had been conducted.

A total of 6844 records were identified from the database searches concerning medicinal plants used for mental health, with 1503 articles related specifically to clinical studies. The second search was for studies of gut microbiota that included the use of these plants with mental health effects, yielding 34 medicinal plants with 887 records. Of these articles, after screening of the title and abstract, 677 were excluded based on the criteria described above (Section 2.1). The remaining 210 full-text articles were further reviewed and screened based on the inclusion criteria, yielding 85 articles on gut microbiome interactions with 30 mental health-related medicinal plants for inclusion in this systematic review. The flowchart of the included studies is depicted in Figure 2.

Table 1 displays the list of the 30 medicinal plants with a clinically proven impact on mental health and for which studies on gut microbiome interactions were available. The included studies on gut microbiota were performed with the same plant parts or extracts as used in the clinical studies. In vitro and in vivo data on gut microbiome interactions are detailed in Table 2 and Table 3.

Many herbal drugs from medicinal plants with clinical effects in mild depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, insomnia, and fatigue contain triterpenoid saponins (Radix Astragali, Herba Centellae, Radix Ginseng, Radix Polygalae, Folium Gynostemmae) or steroid saponins (Radix Polygonatae, Semen Foenugraeci). Saponins have long been of interest for their potential therapeutic benefits in many diseases, but their poor pharmacokinetic properties, with an extremely low bioavailability (frequently < 1.0%), have hampered the translation of these compounds into drugs. Mechanisms of action of saponin-rich plants on the CNS are largely unknown, and their metabolizaton by and modification of gut microbiota have therefore emerged as potential targets.

According to many preclinical studies, certain types of triterpenes possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic properties and thus may contribute to neuronal protection [206,213]. Moreover, triterpene glycosides can be metabolized by gut microbiota into better absorbable active metabolites that become systemically available [206,207,208].

Thirteen in vitro and in vivo studies assessing the effect on the gut microbiota of mental health-related essential oils (orange blossom oil, lavender oil) or herbal drugs rich in essential oils (lemon balm leaf, rosemary, lemon verbena leaf, black cumin, and turmeric root) met the inclusion criteria. For lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Mill.) oil, traditional use is stated for the indication of sleep disorders, temporary insomnia, mental stress, and mood disorders according to the current European Medicines Agency monograph [214]. Orange, lavender, lemon verbena, and rosemary are used to treat anxiety and insomnia, suggesting anxiolytic and sleep-promoting effects. The most abundant essential oil constituents in bitter orange (Citrus aurantium L. ssp. aurantium) flowers are limonene and linalool. D-Limonene shows antidepressant-like effects by influencing the neuroendocrine, neurotrophic, and monoaminergic systems [215]. In a cultivation-based in vitro study with 12 gut bacterial species, the essential oils of lavender and orange blossom showed preferential inhibitory activity against potentially pathogenic gut microorganisms while having a reduced impact on gut microbes regarded as beneficial [88].

Many of these findings indicate that it is not the essential oil but rather more polar constituents that are responsible for the interaction with gut microbiota, such as the phenolic diterpene carnosic acid in the case of rosemary, or polysaccharides and curcuminoids in the case of turmeric. This may be because essential oil constituents have a low molecular weight and are rather lipophilic, making them more likely to be absorbed in the upper intestine [218]. Therefore, they are less likely to come into contact with the gut microbiota. Hence, the pronounced mental health-promoting effects of volatile oils [219] may arise via routes other than the MGBA.

Extracts of Ginkgo biloba L. leaves are used worldwide in a standardized form, containing diterpene lactones (ginkgolides A, B, C, J), the sesquiterpene lactone bilobalide, flavonoids (mainly as glycosides), and polysaccharides. They are applied to neurological disorders connected to impaired cognitive functions and have been considered for anxiety and depression. In an in vitro study with rat intestinal bacteria, the time course of biotransformation of those constituents notably differed among diabetic rats, diabetic nephropathy rats, and healthy rats [107]. The composition and function of gut microbiota can change in response to diseases. If plant constituents are biotransformed by gut microbiota in vivo, their metabolism and absorption in the digestive tract may change with disease-induced changes in the microbial community composition and function. These alterations may, in turn, modulate the systemic effects of these compounds.

Overall, extracts from G. biloba and C. sativus mitigated gut dysbiosis and enhanced Lactobacillus species compared with untreated control groups in animal studies. The study on C. sativus was rather preliminary and performed with healthy rats; the investigation of G. biloba was performed with rats that had stress-induced depression behaviors. Because that study was performed with a gingko fraction containing mainly polysaccharides, obviously the polysaccharides and not the terpenes or flavonoids were responsible for the apparent diminution of depressive signs.

Polyphenols are a broad group of phytochemicals made up of hydroxylated phenyl moieties and present in medicinal plants, tea, fruits, and cereals [27]. The polyphenolic compounds reviewed here belong to three groups: lignans (phenylpropane derivatives), flavonoids (flavan-3-ols, flavanones, flavones, flavone-3-ols, anthocyanidins, and isoflavones), and tannins (derivatives of catechin or gallic acid). Polyphenol esters, glycosides, or polymers are not usually absorbed in the small intestine, and interaction between gut microbiota and dietary polyphenols has often been reported. The gut microbiota can metabolize polyphenols, resulting in the production of potentially active metabolites that can reach the systemic circulation and, in some cases, cross the BBB and exert biological activities [220]. Moreover, polyphenols can alter the gut microbiome composition and function by increasing the population of healthy gut bacteria and decreasing the growth of pathogens, producing a prebiotic-like effect [220].

Recent clinical trials provide evidence for the use of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. and Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. & Maxim.) Maxim. in mental (anxiety, depression) and behavioral disorders, including cognitive function, memory, and attention [170]. Most schisandra lignans have a dibenzocyclooctadien skeleton, whereas E. senticosus roots contain a mixture of the lignans eleutherosides B4, D, and E, together with phenylpropanoids. In vivo studies indicate that some isolated constituents such as the lignans schisandrin B and eleutheroside E and the phenylpropanoid eleutheroside B contribute to the activity of the total extracts [103].

In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial with 28 obese women, fecal microbiota community changes after the administration of an aqueous S. chinensis fruit extract were found to be different for each participant. This result indicated that S. chinensis affected the gut microbiome, but in different ways, depending on the pretreatment gut microbiome composition [174]. Overall, the data suggest that lignans are the most effective fraction of S. chinensis in the relief of depressive and anxiety disorders. Their activity may, at least in part, be related to the bidirectional connection between the gut microbiome and the brain. Furthermore, polysaccharide-rich S. chinensis extracts were able to reduce the abundance of potentially harmful bacteria through the production of SCFAs and regulate intestinal homeostasis.

Clinical studies indicate that flavonoid consumption may ameliorate mental disorders such as depressive symptoms [222], but the mechanisms involved in these effects have not been fully elucidated. Some flavonoids are orally bioavailable and pass the BBB, and certain flavonoid groups show binding affinity for the benzodiazepine site on the GABA A receptor and inhibit monoaminoxidases A and B [223]. Moreover, flavonoids act as antioxidant agents because of their hydrogen-donating ability, which may ultimately result in neuroprotection [224]. However, a high proportion of flavonoids are not absorbed in the upper intestine and therefore potentially interact with the gut microbiome. These compounds may possess prebiotic effects, since gut bacteria have been reported to be capable of utilizing them [225].

Overall, most studies retrieved on flavonoid-rich, mental health-related medicinal plants were focused on their effects on gut microbiota, while the potential impact of microbial flavonoid metabolites on targets related to the MGBA remained widely unconsidered and deserves a more systematic assessment in the future.

As already mentioned in Section 3.2.2, grape preparations have positive effects on mental health. While flavonoids and anthocyanins are more abundant in grape peels, grape seeds contain large amounts of condensed tannins.

In summary, condensed tannins present in grape seeds can induce changes in the gut microbiome and mitigate gut microbial dysbiosis. However, several studies have shown diverging results regarding changes in the gut microbiome composition, including increased as well as decreased abundances of Lactobacillus. Changes in the gut microbiome upon almond intake include an increase in beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and a decrease in Bacteroidetes, while an antidepressant effect may be related to an increased abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria, since SCFAs stimulate the secretion of the antidepressant glucagone-like-peptide-1. Several animal studies suggest an improvement in microbial dysbiosis and growth promotion of beneficial bacteria by green tea leaves. It remains unclear whether these changes are caused by the methylxanthines or the catechins. Guarana seed intake, on the other hand, did not lead to beneficial effects on the gut microbiome in two animal studies. This may be attributed to the antimicrobial effects of caffeine, but also to the tannins, which possess widely described antimicrobial effects [242]. The role of gut microbial tannin metabolites in mental health-related disorders has not been systematically studied to date.

A medicinal herb commonly used to treat depression is Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John’s wort). Numerous studies support the role of this plant in the treatment of mild to moderate depression because it has shown comparable efficacy, fewer side effects, and a lower risk of discontinuation when compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [125]. The plant contains a number of compound classes potentially involved in its antidepressant effects such as hyperforins, polyphenols (including flavonoids such as hyperoside), naphthodianthrones (hypericin), and procyanidins [243]. In a recent animal study, the effects of H. perforatum on the gut microbial community composition were investigated in ovariectomized rats. Ingestion of a H. perforatum extract could reverse gut microbiome changes at the phylum level caused by ovariectomy-induced estrogen deficiency, and extract application mitigated the increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio [126].

Figure 4 shows a schematic representation of the key mechanisms of the MGBA through which polyphenols and their microbial-derived metabolites could exert a favorable effect on mental health conditions. Polyphenols exert a prebiotic-like influence on the gut microbiota that may contribute to positive MGBA effects. Moreover, inactive polyphenols are metabolized by gut microbiota to bioavailable and bioactive metabolites [247,248,249]. These active metabolites can reach the systemic circulation by crossing the intestinal epithelium and enhance brain function by regulating pro-inflammatory mediators, the HPA axis, vagus nerve communication, neurotrophic factors, and serotonin levels. Some of them may also permeate the BBB. Moreover, polyphenols may exert antioxidant effects and lower enhanced reactive oxygen species levels in the brain [27,220,250]. In addition, they can stimulate SCFA production by the gut microbiota [251].

Dietary fibers are plant polysaccharides that are indigestible in the upper intestinal tract but that can be metabolized by intestinal microorganisms. These fibers and their microbiota-mediated metabolic end products, i.e., SCFAs, can modulate the gut microbiome composition [37]. Traditional medicines rich in polysaccharides that are used to promote mental health include the rhizomes of Dioscorea opposita (= D. oppositifolia L.; Chinese yam) and the fruits of Lycium barbarum L. (goji). A water–ethanol extract from Chinese yam significantly improved conditions such as fatigue, stress, depression, sleep, and calmness [98], while a standardized juice of L. barbarum fruits was associated with improved cognitive function, especially semantic fluency [134].

As known from other herbal materials, plant-derived polysaccharides that are indigestible in the upper intestinal tract are metabolized by gut microbiota into SCFAs that can influence the gut–brain axis via three major pathways [36,253]. Via the neural pathway, SCFAs can reduce cortisol levels; via the immune pathway, they decrease the levels of inflammatory mediators and microglial activation; and via the humoral/metabolic pathway, they can exert beneficial effects on serotonin synthesis, neurotrophic factors, and various gut neuropeptides. Moreover, SCFAs may restore tight junctions in the leaky intestinal epithelium by increasing the expression of TJPs, and they can exert local beneficial actions on gut health, such as maintaining mucus protection [36,37,253,254,255,256]. A detailed schematic representation of the various pathways describing the possible action of plant polysaccharides (dietary fibers) on the MGBA is presented in Figure 5.

The MGBA is considered a significant therapeutic target for several mental disorders. Medicinal plants contain various classes of secondary plant metabolites, and many of them are poorly absorbed in the upper GI tract due their high polarity and molecular weight. Therefore, most likely, they interact with the gut microbiome and thereby potentially modulate the MGBA. In the present review, 30 medicinal plants showing effects on mental health-related disorders in clinical and animal studies were identified in reports that also showed their potential interaction with the gut microbiota. Overall, 85 in vitro and in vivo studies on this interaction were retrieved.

The results of this review indicate that the two-way interaction between the gut microbiome and medicinal herbs could play a role in mediating their mental health effects. We propose that the plant constituents present in these herbs exert their neuroprotective effects through a multitarget effect on the host and the microbiome and can therefore be referred to as phyto-psychobiotics. Certain compound classes such as polyphenols and polysaccharides have been shown to have prebiotic effects. Terms such as flavobiotics and phytobiotics have been used to refer to phytochemical constituents conferring health benefits on the host by positively influencing the gut microbiome [257,258]. Furthermore, recently, it has been proposed that polyphenols act as duplibiotics, meaning that these phytoconstituents have a dual effect on the microbiome by exerting antimicrobial properties, similar to antibiotics, on one hand, and by acting as prebiotics, positively stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria, on the other hand [259]. Moreover, some of the plant constituents can be metabolized by gut microbiota into pharmacologically active compounds and other postbiotics such as SCFAs, lactate, and phenolic metabolites that can either have a local effect in the gut or be absorbed by the epithelial cells and provide other health benefits to the host via different pathways including the MGBA. Many single plant constituents have been tested for their neuroprotective effects in in vitro and in vivo studies (reviewed elsewhere) [260,261]; however, studies directly assessing the synergistic effects of multiple phytochemical constituents in medicinal plants on MGBA-related targets or pathways are scarce or even non-existent for many candidate plants with clinically proven effects on mental health. Such studies are urgently needed to generate a better understanding of the possible effects of these plants on the MGBA. We recommend that future clinical studies assessing the effect of medicinal plants on mental health should include the analysis of the gut microbiome composition and function to explore the possible action of these medicinal plants on the MBGA. This would facilitate a better understanding of why some individuals respond to interventions while others might be non-responders as they may lack the microorganisms needed to help them metabolize specific plant constituents into active metabolites. Furthermore, combining in vitro GI models, which include both upper and lower GI tract simulation, with multi-omics approaches (e.g., metagenomics, metabolomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics) can be used as a first step to explore the complex bidirectional interaction between plant constituents and the gut microbiome. These approaches will provide insight into the mode of action and health benefits of herbal medicines, and they will support the identification of new active plant constituents and how they might act via the MGBA or confer additional health benefits on the host.
