Gut microbiome and its meta-omics perspectives: profound implications for cardiovascular diseases

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) still remain the leading concern of global health, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths in 2016. The pathogenetic mechanisms of CVDs are multifactorial and incompletely understood. Recent evidence has shown that alterations in the gut microbiome and its associated metabolites may influence the pathogenesis and progression of CVDs such as atherosclerosis, heart failure, hypertension, and arrhythmia, yet the underlying links are not fully elucidated. Owing to the progress in next-generation sequencing techniques and computational strategies, researchers now are available to explore the emerging links to the genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes in parallel meta-omics approaches, presenting a panoramic vista of culture-independent microbial investigation. This review aims to outline the characteristics of meta-omics pipelines and provide a brief overview of current applications in CVDs studies which can be practical for addressing crucial knowledge gaps in this ﬁeld, as well as to shed its light on cardiovascular risk biomarkers and therapeutic intervention in the near future.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. It was estimated that 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2016, representing approximately 30% of all global deaths.1 Despite adherence to recommended therapies including high-dose statins and modification of lifestyle risk factors, curative effect is individual and varied, as well as significant residual risks remain.2,3 Additionally, although genetic predisposition contributes to the pathogenesis of CVDs, genetic variation could only explain 20% of the risk in disease progression.4 Together, these observations suggest that the multiple mechanisms that participate in the pathophysiology of CVDs are incompletely understood, convincing data from biochemical, bioinformatical, epidemiological, and clinical studies will enhance our feasibility in CVDs prophylactic managements.

The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of recent progress in our understanding of gut microbiome in the development of CVDs and to outline meta-omics approaches that can be practical for addressing crucial knowledge gaps in this ﬁeld. Together, this body of work supports the notion that the gut microbiome may shed its light on cardiovascular risk biomarkers and therapeutic intervention in the near future.

While isolating and culturing each individual microorganism is an intractable task, our capability to accurate characterization and quantification these microbial communities and perceive their impact on human biology from the collective nucleotide contents contained in a stool sample has been transformed by progress in technology, particularly next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques and computational strategies. These advances have opened up a panoramic vista of untangling the emerging links to mapping the genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes in parallel, presenting an exciting future ﬁeld of investigation, especially considering the reality that gut microorganisms play a key role in plasticity and adaptation to environmental change and physiological stress. Here we summarized a set of pipelines for properly performing meta-omics studies (Figure 1), which can provide information from different layers of the biosystem.

The composition of human-associated microbial communities has been well assessed by means of culture-independent sequencing technologies, for example by sequencing the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes to yield phylogenetic or taxonomic profiles on account of its applicability in prokaryotes and availability of considerable reference database, giving insight into non-cultivated microorganisms.19 The amplicon-based (marker gene) technologies are limited in their phylogenetic ranges;20 for example, 16S primarily targets in bacteria, whereas 18S in eukaryotes, and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) typically in fungi. Besides, these technologies also suffer from biases from copy-number variations,21 amplification inefficacy,22 and inconsistent characterization.23,24 More recently, genome-wide sequencing approaches, such as metagenomics, have further expanded the popularity and effectiveness for studying the microbiome. Metagenomics is the method of generating millions of short reads (mostly performed using Illumina platforms or Roche 454 pyrosequencing) that randomly sampled from all microbial genomes present in a defined environment or ecosystem, including viral and eukaryotic DNA. Based on adequate sequencing depth (the number of sequencing reads per sample), the taxonomic resolution to species or strain level by aligning reads to annotation reference genomes, and the assembly of whole microbial genomes from the overlapped DNA sequence reads (contigs) are possible.25,26 The complete genome of dominantly abundant microbes can also be reconstructed,27,28 providing a more comprehensive view of their biological potential. Adding a higher level of refinement, metagenomic operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) are clustered as groups of covariance single-copy marker genes, providing a powerful approach to classify and quantify known and currently unknown microorganisms at species-level resolution.29 Additionally, microbial growth rates can be extrapolated from the metagenomic sequencing read coverage, revealing the rates at which bacteria undergo DNA replication in each sample, which could provide insights into pathology.21

The application of metagenomics has massive potentiality in revealing the interactions and mechanisms between the gut microbiome and diseases. However, it also has limitations and requires improvements. First, as metagenomics requires a much higher average genome size than 16S rDNA sequence analysis,37 the involved costs and time are relatively far greater. Second, quality control protocols include human DNA contamination removing are essential to obtain high coverage required for metagenomics.38 Third, different DNA extraction kits, as well as laboratory sampling and storage protocols, also have biases on the assessment of microbial configuration.39 Comparing data across studies applying different bacterial DNA extraction methodologies is challenging.40 Fourth, a proportion of data cannot be assigned due to the insufficient reference databases, particularly a lack of matches for eukaryotes and viruses, which impacts the extraction of organismal and functional information.41 Thus, future advances in the study of the human gut microbiome using metagenomics are promising and more efforts are urgently needed.

Metagenomics provides us with an unprecedented tool that can be used to access the genetic potential and metabolic features of the microorganisms that exist in our biosphere. However, the abundances of metagenomically prevalent pathways inferred by the pipelines describe only the enzymes encoded by one or more microbial genomes, and the relationships to gene expression, protein abundance, and metabolite concentration may not be straightforward. With the rapidly growing area of metatranscriptomics,42 metaproteomics,43 and metabolomics,44 experimental, computational, and conceptual connections between the meta-omics have started to put forward a better understanding of the dynamic gut ecosystem.

Despite these challenges, the future potential for multi-omics data integration represents also opportunities. Multi-omics approaches provide additional insights beyond the capacity of single omics studies, illuminating gene regulation and correlating the presence of microbes with metabolites. Correlation analysis and multivariate statistical methods are the most straightforward and commonly used methods for statistically studying the interconnected relationships,54,55 as well as identifying the key features in multi-omics data integration,56 so that the functional phenotype of gut microorganisms can be inferred. The development of computational methods that complement experimental approaches will likely revolutionize our ability to integrate and interpret multi-omics data and help the research transition into the mechanism.57 Within this context, multi-omics analysis of microbiome with efficiency and quality will become a sufficiently powerful tool to elucidate the ecologic roles of the human gut microbiome.

Epidemiological studies have revealed a series of associations between alterations in the organismal composition of the gut microbiome and cardiovascular traits. In Table 1, we summarize recent ﬁndings from clinical cohorts showing associations between gut microbes and CVDs in humans. From these studies, a discovery pipeline for identifying common and distinctive microbial players in CVDs emerges.

CAD = coronary artery disease; CHD = coronary heart disease; HF = heart failure; NYHA = New York Heart Association; AF = atrial fibrillation.

Nevertheless, the ability to extract precise insights of the interplay between the gut microbiome and CVDs from published research has so far been restricted due to lack of appropriate data in large enough cohorts, as well as ﬂexibility, eﬀectiveness, and robustness of data integration. As the gut microbiome is multiplex, dynamic, and spatially structured, as well as the fact that biological processes do not operate separately but manifest conjointly as molecular cascades and interact across multidimensional omics domains to affect CVDs etiology, it is progressively recognized that specialize in any explicit form of information solely provides limited knowledge into the underlying molecular mechanisms and CVDs phenotypes. Considering the great promise such studies hold for the treatment and prevention for CVDs, it is expected that parallel measurements on multi-omics will be rapidly collected during the next couple of years, and novel methods with standard pipelines for eﬃcient data integration, modeling, visualization, and interpretation will be urgently needed to eﬃciently cope with this multi-dimensional data,90 and transform into practicable precision medicine tools.

The gut microbiome is known to aid in the harvest of nutrients from diet, with about half of the total genome of the gut microbiome being related to the metabolism of central carbon and amino acid as well as the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.91 Dietary components that are unutilized by the host can serve as growth nutrient substrates for the gut microbes, which in turn generate myriad molecules, many of which impact the host physiology,92 functioning as an endocrine organ.93 Through the development of metabolomics techniques and efforts in a series of experiments, there is increasing evidence that some of these metabolites contribute to CVDs pathology (Figure 2).

TMAO was firstly reported by Wang et al. in a landmark paper, which has become the most compelling evidence of a causative link between the gut microbiome, oral intake of nutrient precursors, and CAD risk.94 The conversion of TMAO in humans has been shown to arise via a multistep, metaorganismal, and microbe-dependent pathway commencing with the dietary precursors including choline,94 phosphatidylcholine,94,95 carnitine,18 betaine,94 γ-butyrobetaine (γ-BB),96 and trimethyllysine (TML),97 which are most abundant in foods found in a western diet, including red meat, egg yolks, milk, and other animal products with high levels of saturated or unsaturated fat.98,99 Gut microbial metabolism of these precursors begins with specific microbial trimethylamine (TMA) lyases encoded by genes including choline-TMA lyase system (CutC/D) and the carnitine Rieske-type oxygenase/reductase system (CntA/B and YeaW/X), which humans do not possess, to generate TMA.100 After absorption, the TMA produced is then transported to liver via the portal vein and readily oxidized by host hepatic FMOs (flavin-containing monooxygenases; mainly FMO3) into TMAO.94

Several epidemiological studies showed the prognostic value of plasma levels of TMAO that predicted future cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality.18,95,104,112,113 In addition, elevated levels of plasma TML, alone, or together with TMAO, have been shown to be associated with both near- and long-term major adverse cardiac events after acute coronary syndrome, independent of troponin T levels,114 and circulating levels of γ-BB and its precursor TML may also act as cardiovascular risk markers in patients with carotid artery atherosclerosis.115 Furthermore, several independent studies reported that TMAO may be a strong predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with HF.116–118 A meta-analysis of eight studies also demonstrated that higher circulating TMAO concentration was positively associated with hypertension prevalence, which was dose-dependent.119 Hence, with these inspiring results, although gut microbiome analyses are not yet ready for clinical use, there is a need to include TMAO and its precursors in future studies to delineate the mechanistic pathways involved in CVDs and explore potential therapeutic targets.

BAs are amphipathic molecules that are composed of a diverse array of structurally specific categories.120 Primary BAs are initially synthesized from cholesterol in the host liver and stored in the gall bladder, then secreted into the intestinal (duodenum) lumen upon ingestion of a meal to assist the emulsification of fats and oils for digestion and absorption of lipid-soluble dietary nutrients.121 Most of the primary BAs are actively absorbed and recycled back to the liver, while a small fraction escapes this enterohepatic circulation and enters the colon, where they are deconjugated into secondary BAs via bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity identified in the bacterial genera including Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, and Listeria,121–123 as well as 7α/7β-dehydroxylations found only in anaerobic gut microbes,124 providing microbes with a way in which to reduce the toxicity of bile acids.125

Perturbations to the dynamic interactions among dietary intake, gut microbiome, and specific BAs may thus contribute to cardiometabolic phenotypes and CVDs susceptibly. For example, altered BAs concentrations in plasma are correlated with insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,133,134 and increased relative abundances of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in the gut may contribute to metabolic improvements via modulation of BAs signaling pathways when applying Acarbose treatments.135 A recent cross-sectional study found an increased ratio of secondary to primary BAs in patients with chronic heart failure, which was associated with reduced overall survival in univariate analysis.136 Microbial dysbiosis can lead to decreased BSH activity and impaired cholesterol elimination, thus, promoting atherosclerosis,137 while a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial showed that treatment with Lactobacillus reuteri, a bacteria with elevated BSH activity, significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.138 A better understanding of how perturbation in candidate BAs profiles is mechanistically linked to these processes of disease status or responses to therapy may enhance our views of CVDs pathogenesis in the future.

The human gut microbiome is capable of fermenting carbohydrates in the form of dietary non-digestible fibers, leading to the production of SCFAs, mainly butyrate, propionate, and acetate.139 SCFAs act as main energy source for colonocytes and play an important role in maintaining gut mucosal integrity by facilitating the tight junction assembly.140 Gut dysbiosis can bring a reduction in SCFAs production, causing increased mucosal permeability and leakage of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other pro-inflammatory bacterial products such as circulating endotoxins into the systemic circulation, as well as allowing bacterial translocation.139

A growing number of microbe-derived metabolites, including a variety of aromatic amino acid products like uremic toxins and indole, are thought to potentially favor disease pathogenesis via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.155,156 Phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), a phenylalanine-derived metabolite interacts with adrenergic receptors, was reported to induce hyperreactivity of platelet and be associated with incident risk for major adverse cardiac events in an independent cohort.157 The emphasis is given on the complexities of translating these metabolic signatures into practical clinical biomarkers used to identify patients at risk of CVDs, particularly in terms of whether these changes can lead to new therapeutic strategies like dietary interventions and microbial adjustments.

The oral cavity is also colonized with a highly heterogeneous microbial community,158 oral infections occur frequently in humans and often cause caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis,159 which can lead to edematous swelling and high bleeding tendency, facilitating the transmission of these periodontal pathogens into the bloodstream via the injured oral epithelium along with their by-products or inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-1 or TNF-α).160 Within this complexity, an ever-growing number of oral bacteria have been associated with CVDs, and particularly hypertension161 and atherosclerosis (Figure 3).162 Bacterial DNA of oral origin (e.g., Streptococcus mutans) and periodontopathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola has been frequently detected in atherosclerotic lesions suggesting that bacteria may be rapped at the site of the atherosclerotic lesion and act as potent inducers which may increase inﬂammatory activity.163–166 The pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs, e.g., LPS or peptidoglycan), found commonly on many different pathogens, can bind to a limited number of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on both macrophage and endothelial cells, and through subsequent intracellular signaling trigger the inflammatory response,167,168 leading to a more vulnerable plaque, thereby increasing the risk of CVDs. Some of these receptors include toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domains (NODs), CD14, complement receptor-3, lectins, and scavenger receptors.169–171 In addition to recognizing PAMPs, these receptors are also involved in the uptake of oxidized LDL by macrophages, which play a causative role in exacerbating atherosclerosis.172

Oral diseases and CVDs share a large set of overlapping risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes mellitus, age, obesity, and poor socioeconomic conditions,173 as well as common genetic susceptibility variants174 and biomarkers,175 suggesting a possible common pathophysiology of periodontitis and CVDs. Previous observational studies have supported an association between periodontitis and atherosclerosis independent of known confounders; however, the evidence did not support a causative relationship.176 Recently, it was inspiring that a population-based cohort study containing 247,696 participants in Korea demonstrated oral hygiene improvements such as frequent tooth brushing and regular dental visits for professional cleaning were associated with 9% and 14% significantly lower risk of cardiovascular events after multivariable adjustment.177 Considering as a highly feasible and daily manageable intervention to prevent CVDs, in the near future, randomized controlled trials would require a large population, an adequate follow-up length, and an ethically acceptable control group to elucidate the effects of oral hygiene behaviors on attenuating the cardiovascular risk originating from periodontal disease and dental caries.

The gut microbiome and its hosts are no longer heralded as autonomous entities, but rather as holobionts. As such, their collective genomes forge a hologenome, and these concepts afford a holistic view of biological complexity.178 Therefore, while human evolution undoubtedly shaped the gut microbiome via changes in factors such as host genetic background, dietary habits, and social behavior during the admixture and introgression processes of human ancestors,179–181 we believe genetic interactions between the gut microbiome and hosts might play an essential role in increasing a host’s acclimation capacity (individual level) and adaptation capacity (population level), even modulating disease severity.182 One of the examples in humans suggested that the gut bacterium Bacteroides plebeius in Japanese individuals has acquired genes encoding carbohydrate active enzymes, which are absent in the human genome, from the seaweed-associated bacterium Zobellia galactanivorans in non-sterile food (i.e., sushi).183 Additionally, the differences in digestion ability due to allelic variations of human genes LCT (encoding lactase) and AMY1 (encoding salivary amylase) could be modified by Bifidobacterium (a lactose-metabolizing genus),184 Ruminococcus (a resistant-starch fermentation genus),185 or other functionally redundant microbes, thus may mitigate energetic trade-offs and contribute to host-adaptive evolution. Similar patterns were also observed when humans encounter environmental fluctuations,186 and some commensal bacteria can even determine the phenotype of hosts carrying risk alleles for inflammatory disease.182

Obviously, these reciprocal interactions facilitate rapid adjustments in host phenotypes across much shorter timescales compared with the classic models of selective pressure on the human genome. A better understanding of the relationship between the host genome and gut microbiome in the context of adaptive evolution will add another dimension to our knowledge as we moved with our microbes through time and space. Therefore, intertwined processes with host genetics must be considered when exploring the potential of the gut microbiome to influence CVDs pathogenesis. Currently, no study has tested the hypothesis and its biological relevance in an eco-evolutionary trajectory, investigating host genome–microbiome interactions in a wider range of human populations will help researchers go beyond collections of anecdotes to form the foundation of a theory that takes microbiome contributions to host physiology and disease progression into account in a formal framework. Microbial transplantations may help to demonstrate the effect of the gut microbiome on host phenomes, combining with metagenomics and other meta-omics approaches to reveal mechanisms underlying genotype-phenotype variation involving simultaneous pathological changes in diverse levels that contribute to disease risk. Furthermore, as microbial gene repertoires are highly malleable, it offers not only the metagenomic plasticity that expedites host acclimation and adaptation, but exciting prospects for novel therapies.

Although our understanding of how the gut microbiome impacts the pathogenesis of CVDs is still rudimentary, the rate at which new discoveries are emerging is impressive. As outlined, there is overwhelming evidence that microbe-related processes, in general, are linked to multiple CVD-relevant phenotypes, including but not limited to atherosclerosis, blood pressure, platelet reactivity and thrombosis potential, cardiac rhythm, lipid metabolism, and vascular inflammation, which provides us with exciting areas of investigation to translate it into microbiome-based clinical or pharmaceutical practice. Unsurprisingly, inhibitors of TMA formation that targeting microbial TMA lyases have been developed, which could reduce TMAO levels and reverse atherosclerosis in mice models.187 Moreover, bile acid activation of FXR can inhibit NF-κB pathway, thereby ameliorating inﬂammation and improving myocardial function;188 TGR5 agonists can exert a cardioprotective function and improve myocardial response to physiologic, inotropic, and hemodynamic stress in mice,189 and thus may consider their roles in the treatment of heart failure in the future. Whereas dietary interventions, prebiotics and probiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) are all potential candidates showing the ability to favorably alter gut microbial profiles and its functional output in some human studies, results are highly variable, and findings from animal models have not yet been transformed to evidence of clinical efficacy, and large, prospective interventional studies will be needed to validate these gut microbiome-targeted therapeutics.190

Given the complexity and heterogeneity of the gut microbiome, as well as the state-of-the-art technological advances, a meta-omics approach holds the promise as a path toward unraveling host–microbiome interactions and assessing causality in clinical settings. However, the current application of meta-omics integrations in the ﬁeld of CVDs has so far been limited. Obviously, one of the main reasons for this is inadequate research design and lack of standardized methods. The parallel measurements on multiple omics layers and proper preprocessing are important for removing outliers and non-biological variations and increasing the comparability between data from different studies. In the coming future, standardized meta-omics pipelines and updated bioinformatic methods with high-resolution of microbial taxa characterization at the strain level can effectively capture a holistic view of pathogenic mechanisms, and ultimately achieve more comprehensive phenotyping of our physiology to select composite diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for risk stratification and precision medicine, realizing the full potential of this field.
