Gut Microbiome-Targeted Modulations Regulate Metabolic Profiles and Alleviate Altitude-Related Cardiac Hypertrophy in Rats



It is well known that humans physiologically or pathologically respond to high altitude, with these responses accompanied by alterations in the gut microbiome. To investigate whether gut microbiota modulation can alleviate high-altitude-related diseases, we administered probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in rat model with altitude-related cardiac impairment after hypobaric hypoxia challenge and observed that all three treatments alleviated cardiac hypertrophy as measured by heart weight-to-body weight ratio and gene expression levels of biomarkers in heart tissue. The disruption of gut microbiota induced by hypobaric hypoxia was also ameliorated, especially for microbes of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families. Metabolome revealed that hypobaric hypoxia significantly altered the plasma short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids (BAs), amino acids, neurotransmitters, and free fatty acids, but not the overall fecal SCFAs and BAs. The treatments were able to restore homeostasis of plasma amino acids and neurotransmitters to a certain degree, but not for the other measured metabolites. This study paves the way to further investigate the underlying mechanisms of gut microbiome in high-altitude related diseases and opens opportunity to target gut microbiome for therapeutic purpose.

IMPORTANCE Evidence suggests that gut microbiome changes upon hypobaric hypoxia exposure; however, it remains elusive whether this microbiome change is a merely derivational reflection of host physiological alteration, or it synergizes to exacerbate high-altitude diseases. We intervened gut microbiome in the rat model of prolonged hypobaric hypoxia challenge and found that the intervention could alleviate the symptoms of pathological cardiac hypertrophy, gut microbial dysbiosis, and metabolic disruptions of certain metabolites in gut and plasma induced by hypobaric hypoxia. Our study suggests that gut microbiome may be a causative factor for high-altitude-related pathogenesis and a target for therapeutic intervention.

Chronic mountain sickness (CMS) is a syndrome generally observed in populations living in high-altitude regions, which develops when the capacity for hypoxia adaptation is lost (1). As a hallmark feature of CMS (2), hypoxia-induced myocardial hypertrophy is also commonly viewed as the fundamental pathological process of chronic heart failure (3), a leading cause for cardiovascular mortality worldwide (4). During the past decades, several biological theories have been proposed to explain the altitude-related pathological cardiac hypertrophy after long-term hypobaric hypoxia exposure, including oxidative stress (5), inflammation (6), and kinase activity (7). However, the underlying mechanisms are still not completely elucidated (8).

In this study, we used a factorial design to investigate the effect of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics treatments on hypobaric hypoxia-induced cardiac hypertrophy. We profiled the fecal microbiota, fecal SCFAs and BAs as well as plasma metabolome and cytokines. Our results showed that administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics significantly attenuated the cardiac hypertrophy, dysbiosis of gut microbiota and plasma metabolic profiles in hypobaric hypoxia-challenged rats, suggesting that gut microbiota-targeted treatments might be promising therapeutic strategies for altitude-related cardiac hypertrophy.

As shown in Fig. S1A, the rats were randomly placed in two environments: normobaric normoxia (NN) and hypobaric hypoxia (HH). NN rats were maintained at sea level, while HH rats were kept in hypobaric hypoxia chamber simulating 5,000 m high-attitude environment for 28 days. Our parallel study has proved that prolonged exposure of HH leads to pathological myocardial hypertrophy with profound changes in gut microbiota and metabolites. To determine whether oral administration of probiotics and/or prebiotics could restore the gut microbial ecosystem and attenuate HH-induced cardiac hypertrophy, the rats in both environments were daily gavaged with saline as control, probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics for 28 days. The probiotics supplement contains 3 Bifidobacterium strains (B. animalis subsp. lactis V9, B. longum KT-L9, B. adolescentis KT-A8) and 6 Lactobacillus strains (L. casei Zhang, L. plantarum P-8, L. paracasei KT-P6, L. rhamnosus M9, L. acidophilus KT-A1, L. helveticus H9); the prebiotics consists of polydextrose, galactose, and inulin; and the synbiotics is a mixture of the two. We sampled rat stools before (day 0) and after treatments (day 28). Plasma and heart were collected at the end of the experiment.

To verify the presence of probiotics after 28 days of gavage, we utilized specific primers and performed qPCR experiment to detect L. casei Zhang and L. plantarum P-8 strains, as well as L. rhamnosus, L. helveticus, B. adolescentis species, B. animalis subsp. lactis, and Bifidobacterium genus. Significant higher levels of L. casei Zhang (Fig. S2B), L. plantarum P-8 (Fig. S2C), L. rhamnosus (Fig. S2E), B. animals sub. lactis (Fig. S2F), and Bifidobacterium (Fig. S2H) were observed in HH-probiotics rats on day 28 than that on day 0. We also compared the abundance of L. casei Zhang (Fig. S2I), B. animals sub. lactis (Fig. S2J) and Bifidobacterium (Fig. S2K) on day 28 in both saline and probiotics groups. Their abundances were increased in probiotics group compared to that in saline group under both NN and HH conditions. The results together confirm the presence of probiotics in feces.

Studies have shown that hypoxia could induce cardiac hypertrophy, an adaptive response of heart to increase workload to maintain cardiac homeostasis, which is usually characterized by elevated heart size (27, 28), cardiomyocyte size, and thick ventricular walls (29). A significant increase in heart size (Fig. 1A and
B) and heart index (the ratio of wet heart weight to total body weight, Fig. 1C) were observed in HH rats. Interestingly, probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic treatments all statistically significantly diminished the increase of heart size (Fig. 1A and
B) and heart index (Fig. 1C) induced by hypobaric hypoxia, indicating that they effectively alleviated altitude-related cardiac hypertrophy, while having little influence on rats under NN condition.

Physiological or pathological are two types of cardiac hypertrophy. Differing from physiological hypertrophy with normal contractile function and cardiac structure, pathological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by myocardial remodeling and finally progress to heart failure. As biomarkers of cardiac fibrosis, type I and type III collagen gene expressions are increased, serving as an important characteristic of progressive heart failure (30, 31). Lower ratio of type I and type III collagen is commonly observed in ischemic cardiomyopathy (32). In our study, we observed higher levels of type I and type III collagen and reduced type I/type III collagen ratio in HH saline group compared to NN saline group, indicating cardiac remodeling and ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, treatments with probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics failed to affect these changes in type I (Fig. 1D), type III collagen (Fig. 1E), or their ratio (Fig. 1F). Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are hormones secreted by the heart and they increase in accordance with the severity of pathological hypertrophy (3). Their mRNA levels were dramatically higher at the apex of the heart tissue in HH saline rats compared to those in NN saline rats. The expression of ANP was slightly downregulated after treatment with probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics, even though only synbiotics group significantly lessened the ANP level (Fig. 1G). Similarly, the BNP gene expression was also partially restored in the HH treated rats (Fig. 1H). Cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) is another hypertrophic marker and is expressed in alpha and beta isoforms (33). βMHC is often found to be upregulated and the gene expression ratio of αMHC/βMHC isoforms lowered in pathological heart hypertrophy (3). Our results showed that the hypobaric hypoxia challenge decreased αMHC (Fig. 1J) and increased βMHC (Fig. 1I), resulting in a reduced αMHC/βMHC ratio (Fig. 1K). This decreased ratio was moderately reversed after treatments, especially the synbiotics group (P value < 0.05, Fig. 1K), mainly via the upregulation of αMHC expression (Fig. 1J). Compared to the HH saline rats, the βMHC expression levels in the treated rats were not significantly changed, although they appeared a bit lower in the probiotics and synbiotics groups (Fig. 1I). Collectively, our data suggest that gut microbiome-targeted treatments alleviated pathological hypertrophic changes caused by the prolonged HH exposure.

To investigate the gut microbiota changes induced by probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in hypobaric hypoxia-challenged rats, we performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the V4 region on stool samples collected on day 0 and 28. The taxonomy composition consisted mostly of Ruminococcaceae followed by S24_7, Lactobacillaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Prevotellaceae, and unresolved families from Closteridiales order, which account for more than 80% of the total abundance (Fig. S2), agreeing with previous reports (34). It seems the abundances of S24_7, Lactobacillaceae, and Prevotellaceae were changed by prolonged hypobaric hypoxia exposure. However, the taxonomic difference is not discernible among treatment groups on the family-level taxonomy plot.

Next, we identified a set of individual microbes whose abundances were significantly altered by hypobaric hypoxia. Most of these microbes belong to family Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae (Fig. 3A, Table S2). The treatments reversed some of these alterations. For example, the log-ratios of ASVs of family Ruminococcaceae and genus Oscillospira were sharply reduced to NN level with the treatment of probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics (Fig. 3A). In the parallel study, we found hypobaric hypoxia exposure altered the abundance of genera Parabacteroides, Alistipes, Prevotella, Lachnospira, and Lactococcus as well as Bacteroides to Prevotella ratio. Here, we also looked into these taxa on genus level and observed that the treatments attenuated these alterations to variating degrees, except for Lachnospira (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results suggest that hypobaric hypoxia challenge disrupts normal gut microbiota composition, and this disruption can be considerably alleviated by administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.

SCFAs and BAs are 2 major types of active small molecules produced by gut microbiota that can affect host physiology (36). We profiled 9 SCFAs and 15 BAs in stool collected on both day 0 and day 28 with high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Resembling the gut microbiota result, the overall fecal SCFA (Fig. 4A) and BA profiles (Fig. 4B) were both primarily driven by rat age. Mantel test also showed the correlations between day 0 and day 28 were not significant (SCFAs p-val = 0.73, BAs p-val = 0.40). Therefore, we applied similar log-ratio transformation on the fecal SCFA and BA data for downstream analyses. Unlike the gut microbiota result, PERMANOVA analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference between NN and HH rats of saline treated control group for either SCFA or BA profile. However, the Euclidean distances of fecal SCFA profiles between NN and HH rats were decreased in the prebiotics treated group (Fig. 4C) and similarly for fecal BA profiles in the prebiotics and synbiotics treated group (Fig. 4D). This suggests that prebiotics and synbiotics might be able to offset the effect of HH on fecal SCFA and BA profiles, even though such HH effect was not statistically significant, probably due to small effect size and sample size.

We further identified three individual metabolites that were differentially abundant between NN and HH saline rats. All of them are SCFAs: 2-methylbutyric acid, isovaleric acid, and isobutyric acid. However, none of these altered SCFAs could be reversed by the treatments (Fig. 4E).

By comparing metabolite profiles of germfree rodents with those of conventional (37,–40), it is clearly demonstrated that a significantly large number of metabolites in the host blood arise from gut microbiome. Recent metabolomic studies revealed strong associations between gut microbial derived or host endogenous metabolites and various diseases (41). Therefore, to investigate the shift of plasma metabolome in association with hypobaric hypoxia and treatments, we quantified plasma metabolites, including SCFAs, other medium- and long-chain free fatty acids (FFAs), BAs, amino acids (AAs), neurotransmitters (NTs) and cytokines on day 28. PERMANOVA based on Aitchison distance (42) showed that hypobaric hypoxia challenge induced overall profile changes of plasma SCFAs, BAs, AAs, FFAs, and NTs (all p-val < 0.01) but not cytokines (p-val = 0.062). Probiotic treatment lessened these changes for AAs (Fig. 5A) and NTs (Fig. 5B) but not for the other types of metabolites (Fig. S3A-C).

We performed two-way ANOVA analysis to examine the influence of hypobaric hypoxia and its interaction with treatments on individual metabolites. Fig. S3D showed all the metabolites that were statistically significantly altered by the prolonged hypobaric hypoxia challenge alone, including kynurenine, kynurenic acid, and glutamate. Among them, some metabolites were observed with statistically significant interaction effects of HH and the treatments. The levels of these HH-altered metabolites (mostly BAs and FFAs) were statistically significantly restored by treatments, most prominently seen in synbiotics-treated group (Fig. 5C to
H).

For each pair of collected data sets, we performed Mantel test to look for correlations between their overall compositions (Fig. 6A). Unsurprisingly, we found strong correlations among gut microbiota, fecal (but not plasma) SCFA and BA profiles. Gut microbiota was also correlated with amino acids and neurotransmitters, reflecting the impact of gut microbes on amino acid metabolism and neuroactive molecule production. Looking at individual SCFA, we observed that acetate levels in plasma and stool was positively correlated, but they were negatively correlated with most of other SCFAs. Fecal butyric acid was significantly positively correlated with plasma butyric acid, and moderately correlated with 2-methylbutyric acid, isovaleric acid, and hexonoic acid (Fig. 6B). Overall, fecal BAs were correlated with plasma BAs (Fig. 6A), probably because majority of BAs in the gut are reabsorbed back via enterohepatic circulation. Most individual correlations between plasma and fecal BAs were not statistically significant except for plasma UDCA versus fecal CDCA and plasma GDCA versus fecal LCA (Fig. 6C).

We performed pairwise correlation analysis between fecal microbes and fecal/plasma metabolites. After multiple hypotheses correction, we listed all the significant correlations as in Fig. 7 (FDR < 0.01, cor coefficient > 0.5). We observed that the microbes and metabolites could be roughly divided into two correlation patterns after sorting the rows and columns according to their correlation coefficients. Specifically, three microbes of family Christensenellaceae, which was reported as highly heritable and depleted to obesity and metabolic syndrome [43], were all negatively correlated with Phe, Glu, and Cholesterol.

Hypobaric hypoxia is the main factor responsible for the development of high-altitude illness. Complex interactions between human genetics and the environment factors contribute to individual susceptibility to hypoxia-induced high-altitude illness. Its most effective treatments are descent of altitude, supplemental oxygen, and medical therapies such as administration of acetazolamide. Recently, emerging evidence, including our parallel study, has demonstrated that hypobaric hypoxia has a profound influence on gut microbiome. However, it is still inconclusive whether hypoxia-induced syndrome and gut microbiome shift is merely an association or there is causal link between them. If gut microbiome dysbiosis contributes to the manifestation of high-altitude diseases, gut microbiome-targeted intervention may serve as an effective treatment.

In conclusion, the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics significantly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy inflicted by prolonged hypobaric hypoxia exposure. The hypobaric hypoxia-induced gut microbiome shift, as well as metabolome alterations, was also ameliorated by the interventions, suggesting that gut microbiome modulation can serve as a therapeutic treatment for high-altitude diseases.

Eighty specific-pathogen free male Wistar rats were obtained from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). All rats were raised in homogeneous conditions. As shown in Fig. S1, after a 6-day adaptive period, the rats were randomly divided to normobaric normoxia (NN) and hypobaric hypoxia (HH) group. NN rats were kept at sea level; HH rats were transported into a chamber to simulate the altitude at 5,000 m for continuous 28 days. HH rats were maintained in sustained hypoxia for the first week. To guarantee the safety of researchers and quality of HH, we changed the housing condition to intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (>20 hypoxic hours/per day) for the next 3 weeks. Our study aimed to identify the effect of probiotics/prebiotics via gut microbiome, thus the rats in each environment were gavaged with saline, probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics everyday (10 rats/group).

The commercial probiotics was obtained from Beijing Hi-LongCare MedPharmaicine & Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). According to the company’s claim, it contains 3 Bifidobacterium strains (B. animalis subsp. lactis V9, B. longum KT-L9, B. adolescentis KT-A8) and 6 Lactobacillus strains (L. casei Zhang, L. plantarum P-8, L. paracasei KT-P6, L. rhamnosus M9, L. acidophilus KT-A1, L. helveticus H9). Prebiotics was provided by Beijing Future Science & Technology Development Co., Ltd., which mainly consists of polydextrose, galactose, and inulin. Synbiotics is a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics. All reagents were dissolved in physiological saline (0.9% sodium chloride). All the medications were given by gavage at the daily volume of 3 ml saline per rat. The probiotics was administered at a dose of 5 × 109 CFU (CFU)/rat, the prebiotics was administered at a dose of 1g/rat.

Fecal samples were collected at 3 days before transferring to the chamber (this sample marked as day 0 for convenience) and day 28. Heart and plasma samples were collected at the end of experiments. Heart samples were photographed.

For heart tissues, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent and reverse-transcribed to cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. The marker genes of cardiac hypertrophy at the apex of the heart were quantized via real-time PCR as described previously (55). The primers were listed in the supplemental materials (Table S3).

To verify the probiotics in fecal samples, seven primer pairs for identification of probiotics were selected from previous reports using quantitative PCR method (Table S3). Bacterial genomic DNA from the rat stools was extracted by the QIAam Fast DNA Stool minikit (Qiagen, Germany, cat. no. 51604) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Resulting DNA concentrations were tested using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), and 10 ng/μl of each sample template was directly applied for amplification with the Roche LightCycler 480 instrument and SYBR greenIMaster mix (Roche). Fluorescence detection was performed at the end of the amplification step. The relative expression of target gene to 16S rRNA variable region gene was calculated.

For fecal samples, DNA extraction and purification were performed using QIAamp Fast DNA Stool minikit. Amplicon library for bidirectional sequencing on Illumina MiSeq PE250 platform was constructed using primers 341F 5′-CCTACGGGRSGCAGCAG-3′, 806R 5′-GGACTACVVGGGTATCTAATC-3′ targeted across 16S rRNA genes V3-V4 regions.

Targeted metabolomics in feces and plasma were analyzed at Longsee Biomedical Corporation by UHPLC/MS system. Stool weighing 100 mg was added with added with 400 μl extract of methanol-acetonitrile-water (2:2:1, vol/vol/vol), vortexed and centrifuged at 17,000 g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected for further measurement.

Source conditions were optimized: nebulizing gas flow 3 L/min, heating gas flow 13 L/min, drying gas flow 7 L/min, interface temperature 350°C, DL temperature 150°C, and heat block temperature 400°C. A flow rate of 0.4 ml/min was both utilized in pump. Data were all obtained by using the LabSolutions workstation.

The instruments and analytical conditions were equal to those of fecal metabolites determinations except for sample preparations. For BAs test, plasma was added with extract of methanol-acetonitrile (1:1, vol/vol) to facilitate protein precipitation. After vertexing and centrifuging, the supernatant was collected followed by vacuum drying, and then re-dissolved with methanol-water (1:1, vol/vol). For SCFAs measurement, sample was mixed with extract of methanol-acetonitrile, followed by derivatization and quenching using above-mentioned methods.

Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences were performed with Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology version 2 (QIIME2, version 2019.4) (56). In brief, paired-end raw reads were first joined. QIIME2 deblur plugin was used to quality control and construct a high-quality amplicon sequence variant data (57). An average of 7,348 reads per sample were obtained after this step. Taxonomy assigned against Greengenes database using QIIME2 q2-feature-classifier plugin. ASV table was rarefied to 4,515 sequences per sample to remove the bias of uneven sequence sampling. Alpha and beta diversity metrics were calculated by q2-diversity plugin. Emperor plugin was used to visualize Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) plots. To minimize the influence of age effect, we calculated the log ratio of relative abundance on day 28 over day 0 and applied Euclidian metric to compute beta diversity distances (as UniFrac metric does not support negative values in the log-ratios). The distances between NN and HH samples were computed to assess the effects of treatments on microbiome. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was computed to evaluate significant differences between groups using python scikit-bio library.

We applied total sum normalization for every metabolomic profiles. For fecal SCFAs and BAs, we applied log-ratio transformation of day 28 over day 0, similarly to what was done for 16S amplicon data. Beta diversity and PCoA plots were computed similarly as described above.

Considering the age effect, we therefore combined log-ratio transformation and linear model to distinguish the differential ASVs between NN and HH in saline group, followed by multiple hypothesis testing correction with Benjamini-Hochberg method. The model was fitted with formula using R stat package:

Mantel test (skbio.stats.distance.mantel) was used to compute correlation between distance matrices of every omics profiles. Pairwise correlations between microbes and metabolites were calculated using Spearman's rank (scipy.stats.spearmanr) followed by FDR correction.

The raw sequencing data are available from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive with accession numbers PRJNA715614 and PRJNA715837.
