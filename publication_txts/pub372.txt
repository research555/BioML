Analysis of Gut Microbiota Signature and Microbe-Disease Progression Associations in Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Treated With Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy



To evaluate the association of gut microbiome signature and disease progression in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) by fecal metagenome analysis.

Metagenome-wide association studies on baseline fecal samples from 18 LA-NSCLC patients before CCRT and 13 controls from healthy first-degree relatives were performed. Among the 18 LA-NSCLC patients, six patients were defined as the long progression-free survival (long-PFS) group (PFS≥11 months) while another 12 were in the short-PFS group (PFS<11 months). Alpha diversity, taxonomic composition, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional pathways were compared between groups.

The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes value of long-PFS group was higher than those of short-PFS (p=0.073) and healthy individual groups (p=0.009). Meanwhile, long-PFS group had significantly higher diversities in Fungi, Archaea, and Viruses than short-PFS group. The KEGG pathways overrepresented in short-PFS group included fructose and mannose metabolism (p=0.028), streptomycin biosynthesis (p=0.028), acarbose and validamycin biosynthesis (p=0.013), ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes (p=0.035), biosynthesis of vancomycin group antibiotics (p=0.004), apoptosis-fly (p=0.044), and tetracycline biosynthesis (p=0.044), while those overrepresented in long-PFS group included fatty acid biosynthesis (p=0.035), fatty acid metabolism (p=0.008), vancomycin resistance (p=0.008), longevity regulating pathway-worm (p=0.028), type II diabetes mellitus (p=0.004), and viral carcinogenesis (p=0.003). Further analysis of antibiotic resistome demonstrated that the short-PFS group had a trend with more antibiotic resistance genes than healthy control (p=0.070) and long-PFS groups (p=0.218). The vancomycin resistance sequences were significantly enriched in the long-PFS group compared to the short-PFS group (p=0.006).

The baseline gut microbiome composition and functionality might be associated with PFS in LA-NSCLC treated with CCRT. The outcome of CCRT might be modulated through bacterial metabolic pathways. The antibiotic resistance genes might play a role in disease progression and provide potential information on the relationship between the use of antibiotics and treatment efficacy of CCRT in LA-NSCLC.

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is regarded as the standard treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). However, distant metastases and locoregional recurrences remain major causes of mortality even with the combination of immunotherapy. Recent studies indicate that gut microbial dysbiosis may be an important environmental factor in this subgroup of patients (Liu et al., 2019). LA-NSCLC has traditionally been known to be a complicated disease induced by interactions between the host and the environment (Khan et al., 2021). Microbes, along with other environmental risk factors, play a vital role in maintaining microecological homeostasis and modulating host immunological responses to multiple therapies.

Thus, we launched the study: 1) that uses deep metagenomic profiling of gut microbiomes to discover related microbial genes on baseline fecal samples from LA-NSCLC patients and healthy first-degree relatives; 2) to evaluate the association of baseline gut microbiome signature and disease progression to provide information for clinical practice.

The metagenome-wide association studies were performed on baseline fecal samples from 18 LA-NSCLC patients before CCRT and 13 controls from healthy first-degree relatives. Patients were selected from a prospective clinical trial (NCT02573506) which evaluated the efficacy of hypofractionated CCRT in LANSCLC. Eligible patients had: 1) confirmed diagnosis of LA-NSCLC and treated with definitive CCRT; 2) age between 18 and 85 years; 3) Karnofsky performance score ≥80; and 4) no gastrointestinal tract disorders or intake of antibiotics/corticosteroids/probiotics within last 8 weeks. Patients were excluded if they had: 1) previous anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or immunotherapy (Khan et al., 2021); intellectual disability or refuse to participate in the study; or 3) history of gastrointestinal surgery, such as small bowel resection. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the institutional Ethics Committee of Guangdong Association Study of Thoracic Oncology (GASTO1011 approved on the August 26, 2015, GASTO1017 approved on January 31, 2016.). Informed consents were obtained from all subjects involved in this study. All procedures were conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines.

Among the 18 LA-NSCLC patients, six patients were defined as the long disease progression-free survival (PFS) group (PFS≥11 months) while another 12 were in the short PFS group (PFS<11 months). PFS was calculated as the time from the start of radiotherapy to the date of disease progression or death.

All stool samples were collected in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, kept in sealed containers with some air at a temperature below 8 °C for transit, then processed within 24 hours after collection. Sample protector for DNA (Takara, 9750) was added in all processed samples and stored in a -80°C freezer. Total DNA was extracted from thawed fecal samples using the QIAamp PowerFecal DNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of genomic DNA in each sample was quantified using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). All qualified samples were stored at -20°C for further analysis.

The extracted microbial DNA was processed to construct metagenome shotgun sequencing libraries which were produced using a TruSeq DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ten Gb of 150 bp paired-end reads per sample were produced using an Illumina HiSeq platform to assess the proportion of microbial sequences. Sequence quality control and filtering were conducted by fastp (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) (Chen et al., 2018). Processing steps, including quality control checks, filtering, and metagenome assembly were performed using MEGAHIT (https://github.com/voutcn/megahit) (Li et al., 2015) and Newbler (version 2.6). Contig binning was executed using CD-HIT (http://www.bioinformatics.org/cd-hit/) (Fu et al., 2012), and genes were predicted using MetaGene (http://metagene.cb.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) (Zhu et al., 2010). SOAPaligner software (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/) (Li et al., 2009) was applied to compare the high-quality reads of each sample with the non-redundant gene set (default parameter: 95% identity).

DIAMOND software (https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond) (Buchfink et al., 2015) was used to blast the unigenes to the sequences of Bacteria (Parameter: blastp; E-value ≤ 1e-5) which were all extracted from non-redundant protein amino acid sequence database, including SwissProt, Protein Information Resource, Protein Research Foundation, Protein Data Bank, non-redundant protein data, and protein data translated from coding sequence features from GenBank and RefSeq. Species annotation results were obtained through the taxonomic information database corresponding to the NR library, and then use of the sum of the gene abundances corresponding to the species to calculate the abundance of the species. The abundance of species in each sample at each taxonomic level (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species) were obtained based on the lowest common ancestor annotation results and then gene abundance table corresponding to each taxonomic level was constructed.

We annotated functional gene clusters and compared them with those (Parameter: blastp; E-value ≤1e-5) in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) (Kanehisa et al., 2016). Then we calculated the abundance of the functional category based on the sum of the gene abundances corresponding to KEGG Orthology (KO), Pathway, Module and Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB, http://ardb.cbcb.umd.edu/) through DIAMOND (https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond). The annotation information of antibiotic resistance function corresponding to gene was obtained, and then the abundance of antibiotic resistance function was calculated using the sum of gene abundance corresponding to antibiotic resistance function.

SPSS (version 26.0), GraphPad Prism (version 7.00), and R software (version 3.5.2) were used for statistical analysis. Parameter differences among three groups, including Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B), alpha diversity (Shannon index), and number of antibiotic resistance genes, were tested using one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons. Comparisons between long-PFS and short-PFS groups were performed with Wilcoxon rank sum test or LEfSe (http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy) for quantitative or categorical variables, respectively. P-values were corrected for multiple comparisons with Benjamini-Hochberg method for the false discovery rate.

The clinical characteristics of 18 LA-NSCLC patients and 13 first-degree relatives are detailed in Table 1 . Among the 18 LA-NSCLC patients, six patients were long-PFS group (PFS≥11 months) while another 12 were in the short-PFS group (PFS<11 months). The baseline clinical characteristics of these three groups were comparable.

In all the study population, the proportions of domains at species level were Bacteria 83.87%, Viruses 6.5%, Eukaryota 6.46%, Archaea 3.25%, and unclassified 0.23%. The relative abundance of Bacteria accounted for 99.45%. The abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were different in long-PFS, short-PFS, and healthy individual (38.51% vs. 48.73% vs. 56.35%; 55.21% vs. 42.57% vs. 36.41%, respectively) ( Figures 1A–C ). The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) value of long-PFS group was higher than short-PFS (p=0.073) and healthy individual (p=0.009) ( Figure 1D ). The composition and structure of gut microbiomes in the three groups were also different. The top 15 genera at the genus level were Bacteroides, Prevotella, faecalibacterium, Eubacterium, Clostridium, Roseburia, Blautia, Alistipes, Ruminococcus, Parabacteroides, Oscillibacter, Lachnoclostridium, Bifidobacterium, Coprocccus, and Dorea ( Figure 1E ). There were 7059 species in the three groups in common at species level, and 630 and 815 species were unique to long-PFS and short-PFS group, respectively ( Figure 1F ). Further analysis of the unique species demonstrated that various bacteriophages could be found on these two groups ( Figures 2A–C ), resulting in a significant higher alpha diversity (shannon index) in short-PFS group (P=0.029) and long-PFS group (P=0.021) compared with healthy control group ( Figure 1G ).

To explore the differences of gut microbiota between short-PFS and long-PFS group, LEfSe analysis was performed with an LDA score of 2.0. At genus level, there are four specific genera from the long-PFS group, including Ruminiclostridium (LDA=3.102), Anaerostipes (LDA=3.015), Pseudoflavonifractor (LDA=2.379), and Oribacterium (LDA=2.084) ( Figure 3A ). At species level, there are 30 specific species between two groups, of which 14 species in short-PFS group and 16 species in long-PFS group. The highest LDA score was for Eubacterium_sp_CAG_202 (LDA=3.857) in long-PFS group, and Bacteroides_cellulosilyticus (LDA=2.760) in short-PFS group ( Figure 3B ). Meanwhile, in Eukaryota, Archaea, and Viruses, the main features were in long-PFS group and the number of Fungi features were the most, 109 distinguishing characteristics ( Figures S1 A–C ).

The KEGG analysis of the metagenomic data revealed 8357 KO, with 6098 presented in both long-PFS and short-PFS groups. Short-PFS group had more unique KO compared with long-PFS group (2001 vs. 258) ( Figure 4A ). The KEGG pathways overrepresented in short-PFS group included fructose and mannose metabolism (p=0.028), streptomycin biosynthesis (p=0.028), acarbose and validamycin biosynthesis (p=0.013), ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes (p=0.035), biosynthesis of vancomycin group antibiotics (p=0.004), apoptosis-fly (p=0.044), and tetracycline biosynthesis (p=0.044); while those overrepresented in long-PFS group included fatty acid biosynthesis (p=0.035), fatty acid metabolism (p=0.008), vancomycin resistance (p=0.008), longevity regulating pathway-worm (p=0.028), type II diabetes mellitus (p=0.004), and viral carcinogenesis (p=0.003) ( Figure 4B ).

The resistome was characterized by identifying antibiotic resistance genes annotated in ARDB (Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database) from the metagenomes of each sample using the Short, Better Representative Extract Data set. The short-PFS group had a trend with more antibiotic resistance genes than healthy control (p=0.070) and long-PFS groups (p=0.218) ( Figure 4C ). The top 15 most abundant antibiotic resistance gene types varied between the short-PFS group and the long-PFS group, and the most abundant type was tetQ in short-PFS group and Baca in long-PFS group ( Figure 4D ). Other differentially enriched antibiotic resistance genes included Ermf enriched in short-PFS group (p=0.035), Vanug, Vanwg, Vanrd and Cata2 enriched in long-PFS group (p=0.028; p=0.015; p<0.001; p=0.049, Figure 4E ). The corresponding main types of antibiotics were tetracycline, macrolide, aminoglycosides (streptogramin_b, streptomycin, isepamicin, amikacin), lincosamide, polypeptide (bacitracin, vancomycin), β-lactams (cephalosporin), and sulfonamide ( Figure 4F ). The vancomycin resistance sequences were significantly enriched in the long-PFS group compared to the short-PFS group (p=0.006) ( Figure 4G ). Further analysis of functional metabolic pathway related to the KEGG pathway biosynthesis of vancomycin group antibiotics found that the dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose and 2,3-dehydratase were abundant in long-PFS group (p=0.35), while dTDP-glucose4,6-dehydratase was abundant in short-PFS group (p=0.35) ( Figure S2 ).

To discover which bacterial genera contributed to the ARDB reservoir, we performed a species and functional contribution analysis of ARDB type and the top 50 bacterial genera. The main carrier for antibiotic resistance genes was Bacteroides, followed by Prevotella and Faecalibacterium. Baca had a broad spectrum of carriers, among which Prevotella accounted for the largest proportion, with 12.34% in long-PFS and 15.31% in short-PFS group. TetQ and TetX mainly came from Bacteroides, while Tet37 all came from Prevotella ( Figure 5 ).

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). The outcome of CCRT varies among patients due to many clinical and biological factors. Recent studies indicate that gut microbiota play a vital role in modulating host immunological responses to multiple therapies. Therefore, we aimed to find the association between baseline microbiome signatures and treatment outcome in LA-NSCLC treated with CCRT. We had launched a prospective clinical trial which assessed the efficacy of hypofractionated CCRT in LANSCLC, with a median PFS of 11 months (Qiu et al., 2021). The current study was an exploratory analysis of the clinical trial evaluating the association of baseline gut microbiome and treatment outcome. In the present study, baseline gut microbiome has been investigated in LA-NSCLC patients treated with CCRT and first-degree relatives, aiming to provide information for clinical practice.

The current study has several limitations. Firstly, the samples are collected from 18 patients and 12 first-degree relatives, which may not be sufficiently representative. Integrating data from various subgroups may assist in obtaining new insights. Secondly, the sample distribution is not homogeneous, and the antibiotic medication history of each individual was hard to clarify. It might result in biased identification of specific ARG markers. To reach a broader and fairer conclusion, various kinds of cancers should be investigated, as well as analyses of their ARG markers between distinct cohorts. Thirdly, further investigation and validation in large cohorts needs to be conducted in the future.

The baseline gut microbiome composition and functionality might be associated with PFS in LA-NSCLC treated with CCRT. The higher baseline microbiome diversity related to long PFS and the outcome of CCRT might be modulated through bacterial metabolic pathways. The antibiotic resistance genes might play a role in disease progression and provide potential information on the relationship between the use of antibiotics and treatment efficacy of CCRT in LA-NSCLC. Further research is needed to confirm these results.
