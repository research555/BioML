Reconstitution and Transmission of Gut Microbiomes and Their Genes between Generations

Microbiomes are transmitted between generations by a variety of different vertical and/or horizontal modes, including vegetative reproduction (vertical), via female germ cells (vertical), coprophagy and regurgitation (vertical and horizontal), physical contact starting at birth (vertical and horizontal), breast-feeding (vertical), and via the environment (horizontal). Analyses of vertical transmission can result in false negatives (failure to detect rare microbes) and false positives (strain variants). In humans, offspring receive most of their initial gut microbiota vertically from mothers during birth, via breast-feeding and close contact. Horizontal transmission is common in marine organisms and involves selectivity in determining which environmental microbes can colonize the organism’s microbiome. The following arguments are put forth concerning accurate microbial transmission: First, the transmission may be of functions, not necessarily of species; second, horizontal transmission may be as accurate as vertical transmission; third, detection techniques may fail to detect rare microbes; lastly, microbiomes develop and reach maturity with their hosts. In spite of the great variation in means of transmission discussed in this paper, microbiomes and their functions are transferred from one generation of holobionts to the next with fidelity. This provides a strong basis for each holobiont to be considered a unique biological entity and a level of selection in evolution, largely maintaining the uniqueness of the entity and conserving the species from one generation to the next.

The hologenome concept of evolution [1,2] is based on four principles: (1) All animals and plants are holobionts, consisting of the host and diverse microbiota, including Bacteria, Archaea, eukaryotic microorganisms, and viruses. (2) Interactions between the host and its microbiota often affect the fitness of the holobiont in a beneficial manner, though negative interactions can also occur. (3) Microbiomes are transmitted between generations. (4) Alterations in either the host or the microbiome genomes (the hologenome) can lead to genetic variation and evolution. The microbiome genome is dynamic and changes more rapidly than the host genome. These principles stress the strong connection between the microbiome and the host in which a mutual adaptation has to evolve to achieve the robustness necessary for long-term survival [3,4]. Moreover, if these four principles are correct, then a holobiont with its hologenome is a level of selection in evolution [1,5]. In addition, and as a result, the approach to biological individuality and the concept of self has to undergo a change [6,7,8].

In a nutshell, this article critically examines the evidence, pros and cons, for transmission of microbiota and their genes between holobiont generations. However, there are some obstacles that lie ahead, the main ones being the diverse routes by which microbiota are vertically and horizontally transmitted between hosts [26,27] and the limits of detection of rare microbiota within holobionts [28,29,30]. Additionally, although the number of studies on the microbiota of animals and plants is rapidly expanding [21,31,32], there is still a paucity of species in which transmission of microbiomes have been studied in depth [33,34,35], which makes it challenging to generalize. However, we shall try to come to some general conclusions.

Whereas animal and plant genomes are transmitted between generations by a well-established universal semi-conserved mechanism, microbiota and their genes are transmitted by a variety of different vertical, horizontal modes (Table 1), and as will be discussed later, also by mixed modes. Vertical transmission is defined as the movement of microbiota from parent to offspring without mixing with microbes in the environment, whereas horizontal transmission is defined as coming from the environment [5]. We shall first examine the phenomena of vertical and horizontal transmissions in different organisms and discuss the fidelity of the phenomena, then discuss aspects of quantitative assessment of transmission and finally we will derive some general conclusions from the data presented in the paper.

For a holobiont to be considered a level of selection in evolution, a significant fraction of its microbiome must be transferred between generations [5,8]. The diverse modes of transmission by different animals and plants make it difficult to derive generalizations concerning the fidelity of transmission. However, what is clear is that, in general, a functional microbiome has to be reconstituted each generation, thereby achieving fitness of the holobiont throughout its life. This conclusion leads to a number of major questions regarding the mode of transmission of the microbiome: What fraction of the microbiome is transferred vertically and what fraction horizontally or mixed? Does it matter if the microbiome is reconstituted by vertical and/or horizontal transmission? How important is the transmission of specific taxa as opposed to transferring specific and necessary functions/genes of the microbiome to the next generation? This section examines the fidelity of transmission of the different modes.

Accurate vertical transmission and co-evolution have been demonstrated in many biological systems, co-evolution being defined as the process in which two or more species reciprocally affect each other’s evolution [37]. Funkhouser and Bordenstein [38] have argued that microbial maternal vertical transmission is widespread across animals. Vertical transmission is most important in assuring fidelity and accurate reconstructing of the next generation holobiont and hologenome.

Vegetative reproduction is an asexual reproduction occurring when no embryo is produced. Many plants and some animals can propagate asexually from somatic cells [39,40,41,42]. As a result of this type of reproduction, the microbiome is transferred vertically to offspring as part of the separated tissue. The most obvious example is vegetative reproduction in plants. Diverse plants can multiply vegetatively by producing runners, rhizomes, or root sprouts [43]. Although temporarily connected to the parent, if the segments can live independently after separation, it results in vegetative propagation [44]. Vegetative reproduction also occurs in some simple animals. The animal is broken, into two or more pieces; each fragment can form a fully-grown new organism, identical to the parent. For example, fragmentation occurs in corals [45], worms [46], sea stars [47], and sponges [48]. Budding is another type of asexual propagation in animals, resulting from the outgrowth of a part of the body leading to a separation of the bud from the original organism and formation of two individuals, one larger than the other. Budding occurs in sponges [49], sand dollars [50], Hydra [51], echinoderms [52], and bryozoans [53].

Cytoplasmic inheritance, also referred to as extra nuclear inheritance, is transmission of genes that occur outside the nucleus. It is found in most eukaryotes and includes inheritance of mitochondria and chloroplasts, which can be considered “extreme symbionts” because though now considered organelles, they originated from alphaproteobacteria and cyanobacteria, respectively [54,55]. In general, all animals inherit their mitochondria only from their mother [56]. Maternal transmission of mitochondria is so precise that it can be used in tracing evolutionary lineages and population migrations [57]. Similarly, chloroplasts are maternally transmitted [58], with rare cases of paternal inheritance [59].

Plant seeds play an important role in the vertical transmission of bacteria and fungi between successive generations, thereby ensuring their presence in the next generation [90,91,92]. Seeds have the potential to remain in a dormant state for a considerable period of time until growth conditions become suitable for their germination and development into a new plant [93].

Coprophagy is feces-eating behavior [94]. This mode of microbial transmission via feces consumption has been reported in a large number of animal species, including insects, rodents, piglets, foals, dogs, and nonhuman primates [95]. Coprophagy allows the young animals to obtain gut symbiotic microbes, which they require to digest complex polysaccharides, from their parents [95,96,97]. Koalas use a special adaptation of coprophagy [98,99]. For months, the joey relies entirely on the mothers’ milk; subsequently, the mother produces a special type of feces (pap), which the joey consumes over several days. This process facilitates vertical transmission of microorganisms that are able to digest eucalyptus leaves. Other examples of direct transmission via feeding feces is observed in termites [100,101], and some cockroach species [102,103], in addition to some insects that lay eggs in their feces that is consumed by the hatching offspring [104].

Coprophagy can bring about also a mixed mode of transmission (MMT, see further in this review), namely, not just strictly vertical, but also partially horizontal, as is common among some insects [105]. This takes place when the offspring consume feces from the ground, not directly from the parent.

Many bird species regurgitate food into the mouths of their young, thereby ensuring a direct vertical mode of microbial transmission [106]. Regurgitation and ingestion of food by primates are behaviors that are pervasive in zoos, but have not been observed in animals in the wild [107,108]. Some beetles feed regurgitated food, and potentially also bacteria, to larvae throughout their development [109].

Just as mammals breastfeed their offspring, parent rock pigeons regurgitate pigeon milk from an enlarged part of their esophagus to feed the chicks, termed squabs [110]. However, unlike mammals, both male and female pigeons produce pigeon milk [111]. The relatively high percentage of shared bacterial species between squabs and their parents is a strong indication that the squabs obtain bacteria through regurgitation of parental milk [112,113].

The mode of delivery in all animals shapes the acquisition and structure of the initial microbiome in newborns [114,115]. The newborn human gut is initially colonized via inoculation with maternal vaginal and fecal microbes, when the baby passes through the birth canal (vertical transmission). Direct vertical transmission during birth has been demonstrated in several animals, including bears [116], great apes [117], bats [118], mice [26], beetles [119], and fishes [120,121], in addition to humans [122,123,124]. Moreover, Li et al. [124] demonstrated that antibiotic administration to mothers during birth reduced considerably and changed the vertically transmitted species.

One way to assess whether microbes are influenced by the genetic composition of the host, and therefore conserved across generations, is by measuring heritability (h2)—the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic variance [141]. For example, recently it was reported that 97% of microbiome phenotypes in wild baboons were significantly heritable [142]. In humans, because the overall similarity of gut bacterial community composition between adult mono- and di-zygotic twin pairs is largely the same, it is reasonable to conclude that physical contact during and after birth has a greater influence as compared to genetic relatedness, in determining gut microbial composition [143,144]. Although it is not clear how much of the human gut microbiome is transferred from mother to infant, several groups of bacteria, such as specific strains of Bifidobacterium breve and Lactobacillus plantarum, were shown to be always present in the infant gut and their mothers’ feces and milk [145,146,147], providing direct support for accurate vertical transmission of these strains. Strains from the classes Actinobacteria and Bacteroidia, which are essential components of the infant microbiome, have been shown to be vertically transmitted from mother to offspring and persist for at least 1 year after birth [148].

Breastfeeding is another important route of maternal vertical microbial transmission to offspring in mammals [149,150]. Breast milk from healthy human mothers contains ca. 105 bacteria per ml, composed of hundreds of species of commensal and mutualistic bacteria [151]. These bacteria are provided to the newborn infants’ gastrointestinal tract during early and critical periods of development [152]. Analyses of the DNA of several bacterial strains isolated from mothers’ milk demonstrated that they were identical to those found in the offspring [153]. Asnicar et al. [154] demonstrated that several specific strains (e.g., Bifidobacterium bifidum, Coprococcus comes and Ruminococcus bromii) were present in samples from the same mother–infant pair, while being clearly distinct from those carried by other pairs, which is indicative of vertical transmission.

The origin of human milk microbes is not clear [163]. One suggestion is that a preexisting mammary gland microbiome acts as the initial seed for the human milk microbiome [164]. Another possibility is that microbes access the mammary tissue in non-pregnant, non-lactating individuals because mammary glands are exposed to the environment via the nipple. In fact, bacterial DNA has been identified in non-lactating mammary tissue from women undergoing breast surgery [165]. The non-lactating mammary tissue of nonhuman primates has also been shown to contain bacterial DNA [166]. Thus, bacterial DNA may be present in the mammary gland prior to the onset of first lactation. These bacterial DNA profiles share some features with the human milk microbiome. Furthermore, it was possible to culture bacteria from breast tissue suggesting the presence of a viable mammary microbiome [167,168]. A third possible rout is suggested by studies demonstrating that bacteria consumed orally by lactating women or animals can subsequently be isolated from their milk [169], indicating that bacteria may also reach the mammary gland through an internal pathway. The proposed entero-mammary pathway involves immune cell-mediated bacterial translocation from the mother’s gastrointestinal tract into the mammary gland [170,171]. Bacterial translocation increases toward the end of pregnancy, possibly acting as a second seeding event [172]. Once the milk starts to be produced in the breast, the composition of the microbiome appears to change, probably due to the introduction of different bacterial substrates and immune factors present in colostrum and milk.

Vertical transmission of bacteria over evolutionary time-scales was investigated by analyzing and comparing the 16S rRNA gene sequences of bacteria present in the great apes, including humans [173,174]. Since the host species phylogenies based on the composition of these bacterial communities was parallel to the evolutionary relationships of their hosts, Ochman et al. [173] concluded that “over evolutionary timescales, the composition of the gut microbiota among great ape species is phylogenetically conserved and has diverged in a manner consistent with vertical inheritance”. This conclusion was challenged by Moran and Sloan [9]. They correctly pointed out that vertical transmission of bacterial species, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences alone, cannot be used to prove co-evolution because it is possible, even likely, that over evolutionary timescales other strains of the same species (>97% identity in 16S rRNA gene sequence) could have been acquired from the environment (horizontally).

Moeller et al. [176] used a different approach to test the fidelity of microbiota transmission in great apes. They employed rapidly evolving gene sequences instead of stable 16S rRNA genes, to analyze the fidelity of gut bacterial transmission in humans, wild chimpanzees, and wild bonobos. The analyses led to the conclusion that strains of the common gut bacteria, Bacteroidaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae, have been preserved within host lineages across hundreds of thousands of host generations. Since the divergence times of these co-speciation gut bacteria are congruent with those of hominids, it can be concluded that nuclear, mitochondrial, and gut bacterial genomes, i.e., hologenomes, diversified in concert during hominid evolution. Thus, though a predominant fraction of gut bacteria originates from the environment, a significant fraction has co-evolved for millions of years with hominids and participated in their adaptation and development [177]. Furthermore, Rampelli et al. [178] demonstrated that in the gut microbiota of Neanderthal occupational deposits, dating back 50 thousand years, many well-known beneficial gut commensals already populated the gut microbiome of Homos as far back as the last common ancestor between humans and Neanderthals.

Most symbiotic microorganisms, being part of a holobiont, are adapted to living within their host; moreover, some cannot replicate outside, which reflects their adaptation to specific niches in their hosts [179,180]. In humans and in mice, the two most abundant bacterial phyla are the Firmicutes and the Bacteroidetes, most of which do not grow outside of their host [181]. Adaptation to growth in their hosts is not only common in animals, but is also common in plants [182]. A consequence of this is that symbiotic microbes can generally outcompete environmental organisms for residence in their hosts.

What are the advantages of horizontal transmission of microbiota? Since some of the microbiome members are not vertically transmitted in a reliable way [218], strong natural selection would favor hosts that can seize useful symbionts from the local environment [219,220]. Another advantage of acquiring microbes from the environment is the possibility of genetic variation and evolution of holobionts by the occasional acquisition of a novel beneficial strain [221]. The presence of an environmental component implies that offspring can be colonized by beneficial symbionts as well as environmental bacteria that can harm the host [105,222]. Accordingly, the establishment of a healthy microbiome will depend on the ability of the holobiont to acquire beneficial bacteria and exclude pathogens [223]. During microbiota transmission (whether vertical or horizontal), selection by the host and/or by components of the microbiome, is a key process in establishing and maintaining a holobiont microbial community that is fit for the specific host in its environment [224].

Symbiont transmission modes are best conceptualized on a spectrum between strict vertical and strict horizontal transmission. In between these extreme modes, exist the mixed mode of transmission (MMT), involving vertically and horizontally transmissions of the same microbe or microbiome or host switching of the same microbe [225]. Ebert [225] claimed that MMT is the dominant mode of transmission in the animal and plant worlds. A systematic review and meta-analysis of modes of microbiota transmission performed by Russell [226] showed that out of a total of 528 analyzed symbioses, 43% were strictly vertically transmitted, 21% were strictly horizontally transmitted, and 36% exhibited some form of MMT, which he predicted to be generally underestimated because of relatively fewer data. In general, Russell concluded that external modes of vertical transmission (e.g., secretions), as opposed to internal modes (e.g., intracellular), predisposed holobionts to mixed modes of transmission. In addition, Russell observed that a higher frequency of vertical transmission existed on land and a higher frequency of horizontal transmission existed in aquatic environments [226,227]. The observation of horizontal transmission being more abundant in the marine than in terrestrial environment could arise from the simple fact that water is a conducive medium in which desiccation and osmolarity do not represent a problem, thus encouraging horizontal transmission and host to-host transfer events [4]. For example, in the sponge, Plakina cyanorosea, harboring a relatively low microbial abundance, transmission of its microbiome relies primarily, but not exclusively, on horizontal transmission [220]. However, there is now also evidence for maternal vertical inheritance in deep-sea animals as well [220,228,229], indicating a mixed vertical and horizontal transmission. In chemosynthetic symbionts in deep-sea mussels both horizontal [230] and vertical transmission [231] have been reported. Transmission of chemosynthetic symbionts in these organisms is an important determinant of population structure and genome evolution [230]. It seems that stochastic effects on the colonization of horizontally transmitted bacteria may manifest themselves also on land in differences of microbiota strain composition among hosts, as was reported for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [232].

Moeller et al. [26] working with two strains of mice from the wild, that were bred for up to 11 generations in the lab, demonstrated an individual and population level transmission which was predominantly vertical, but also environmental, namely a mixed transfer of microbes. They also observed that the mode of transmission tends to be dependent on bacterial genera. In addition, aerobic bacteria tended to be transmitted horizontally and anaerobic bacteria-vertically. Other examples of mixed transmission of microbiomes were observed in great apes, as discussed above [175], in ruminants [233,234], in mammalian herbivores [235] in insects [199] and in corals [69].

The most accepted definition of a core human microbiome is a group of microbial taxa or genes that are shared by all or most humans [236,237,238]. This definition can be applied to any other animal or plant holobiont. The reported data to date have led to the conclusion that a universal taxonomic organismal core is small [239,240]. However, it can be argued that it may be much larger than currently recognized because of the failure to detect rare microbes, as will be discussed in Section 4, and the rare undetected microbes may have crucial functions when conditions change [241].

Suárez [248] argued that the holobiont/hologenome can act as a genuine level of selection both in the form of an interactor and in the form of a reproducer. To do so, he maintains that the microbiome should be characterized in functional rather than taxonomic terms.

Reliable and meaningful scientific conclusions from microbiome studies rely on accurate analysis of microbial communities [249]. Several recent publications have discussed procedures for overcoming threats to reproducibility, replicability, robustness, and generalizability in microbiome research [250,251,252,253,254]. In order to evaluate if any particular microbe is transmitted between generations, it is essential to characterize it at the strain level. It is also necessary to detect rare species.

With regard to this article, a false positive refers to an incorrect claim that a specific microbe is transmitted from parent to offspring. The vast majority of studies comparing microbiota in parents and offspring has relied on 16S rRNA gene determination, using > 97% identity to characterize a bacterial species [255]. As many scientists have pointed out > 97% identity of 16S rRNA gene sequences does not prove that two bacteria are identical [256,257,258]. This is particularly relevant to transmission studies because this methodology cannot determine if the offspring obtained the bacterium vertically from the parent [9]. A different bacterium with >97% identity of 16S rRNA gene sequences could have been acquired from the environment harboring slightly different genes. To overcome this problem, strain-specific gene sequences, although still largely underrepresented in public repositories, can be employed to identify bacteria down to the strain level [259,260]. Although not always possible, the most decisive method to prove that a particular bacterium was transmitted from parent to offspring is to perform whole genome sequencing of the bacterium isolated from parent and from offspring [261].

Another source of false positives is bacterial or DNA contamination in reagents used for DNA extraction and PCR [262,263]. Maqsood et al. [264] reported that in his study several infant stool bacterial microbiomes were indistinguishable from buffer background, and thus cannot be attributed to maternal transmission. In a different study, 54% of bacterial signals in the brain was explained by exogenous DNA contamination, and were thus false-positives [265]. DNase treatment has been suggested as a method for removing DNA contamination in PCR reagents [263].

The failure to find a particular bacterium in the microbiome does not mean it is not there. The more accurate conclusion is that it is not present at the limits of detection used in the experiment. As things stand to date, if a microbial species is present, but rare, it is often not detected [266]. For example, if a particular bacterial species was present in 103 copies in the human colon (total bacteria = 1013–1014), it would be necessary to sequence 1010–1011 16S rRNA genes to detect it. This is clearly not practical with the existing technology. In fact, statistical analyses indicate that the reported values of bacterial diversity in microbiomes are underestimations [267]. It is important to point out that even a single bacterium has the potential to amplify in numbers when conditions change to the benefit this specific bacterium, and thus may allow the holobiont to evolve by being more adapted to the new condition.

Another possible source of false negatives are spores. At least 50% of the bacterial genera from the intestinal microbiota of a healthy individual produce resilient spores, specialized for host-to-host transmission [271,272]. However, a phylogenetic assessment of the microbial communities has revealed surprisingly few spore formers [273], probably because spores are known to withstand many traditional methods of DNA isolation and are thus potentially undetectable [274]. The failure to detect rare bacteria and spores makes it difficult to prove or disprove modes of transmission.

In this article, we discussed the importance of vertical and horizontal transmissions of microbes or functions, in the process of creating a holobiont with its hologenome as a unit of selection in evolution. In general, modes of microbiota transmission are diverse, and probably have evolved to fit the needs and the physical and physiological characteristics of the specific holobiont species.

It is clear that despite the great variation in holobionts and in means of transmission discussed in this review, microbiotas and their functions are, in fact, transferred from one generation of holobionts to the next with fidelity. Such reliable transmission provides a strong basis for each holobiont to be considered a unique biological entity and a level of selection in evolution [2,5], largely maintaining the uniqueness of the entity and conserving the holobiont species from one generation to the next, in addition to contributing to adaptation and evolution of the holobiont [281].
