Role of the Microbiome in Regulating Bone Metabolism and Susceptibility to Osteoporosis

The human microbiota functions at the interface between diet, medication-use, lifestyle, host immune development and health. It is therefore closely aligned with many of the recognised modifiable factors that influence bone mass accrual in the young, and bone maintenance and skeletal decline in older populations. While understanding of the relationship between micro-organisms and bone health is still in its infancy, two decades of broader microbiome research and discovery supports a role of the human gut microbiome in the regulation of bone metabolism and pathogenesis of osteoporosis as well as its prevention and treatment. Pre-clinical research has demonstrated biological interactions between the microbiome and bone metabolism. Furthermore, observational studies and randomized clinical trials have indicated that therapeutic manipulation of the microbiota by oral administration of probiotics may influence bone turnover and prevent bone loss in humans. In this paper, we summarize the content, discussion and conclusions of a workshop held by the Osteoporosis and Bone Research Academy of the Royal Osteoporosis Society in October, 2020. We provide a detailed review of the literature examining the relationship between the microbiota and bone health in animal models and in humans, as well as formulating the agenda for key research priorities required to advance this field. We also underscore the potential pitfalls in this research field that should be avoided and provide methodological recommendations to facilitate bridging the gap from promising concept to a potential cause and intervention target for osteoporosis.

This viewpoint article summarizes current knowledge in the microbiome field and identifies research priorities to advance microbiome research in osteoporosis and bone health. Most of the studies in this field have focussed on analysis of the microbiome content of faeces or stool samples which are considered to represent the gut microbiome. Therefore, within this article we will use the broad term “gut microbiome” to describe this research while acknowledging that there is actually very little information on the microbiome content in different parts of the intestine. The overall goal is to improve our current understanding of the relationship between the microbiome and bone health, and to translate this knowledge into actionable recommendations to prevent the development of osteoporosis or to find a cure for patients with this condition.

It has been estimated that nine million fragility fractures occur worldwide each year, which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality [1–3]. The therapeutic options for osteoporosis that reduce fracture risk have expanded as anabolic agents have become available [4, 5]. Despite this, primary and secondary fracture prevention remains sub-optimal [6]. The reasons for this are multi-factorial but include fear of adverse effects of medication and poor co-ordination of healthcare systems [7–9]. A frequent question asked by patients is; “are there any supplements, changes in diet or lifestyle change that I can make instead of taking drugs?” [10].

Historically, the relationship between the gut microbiota and bone health has received scant attention in the literature. However, in less than five years, mechanistic studies in animals have progressed to association studies in humans; and onwards to clinical trials of the effects of probiotics in women with reduced bone mineral density (BMD) [16–19]. The acceleration in microbiome research in bone metabolism is not unique since interest has increased exponentially across many other medical specialties. Exploring the influence of the microbiota on bone health provides a novel and exciting means of advancing our understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and potentially unearthing new preventative and therapeutic targets.

A new term of osteo-microbiology was introduced for the rapidly emerging research field of the role of the gut microbiota in bone health [20]. Much of the interest stemmed from initial findings in murine studies [21]. The available literature may be broadly compartmentalized across three categories of animal studies; Germ-free (GF) murine studies; antibiotic/probiotic/prebiotic intervention studies; and models of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

One of the earliest studies, by Sjogren et al. demonstrated that mice raised in GF environments, who therefore lack a gut microbiota, exhibited higher trabecular bone mass and reduced osteoclastic activity compared to conventionally raised mice [22]. Furthermore, repopulation of the gut of the GF mice with microbiota from the distal intestine of conventionally-raised mice led to a normalization in bone mass. This suggests that the presence of the gut microbiota is required for normal osteoclastic activity. Further studies by this group demonstrate that the ability of the gut microbiota to increase osteoclastogenic RANKL and TNF-α activity in bone is dependent on Nod-like receptors NOD1 and NOD2 in the host [23]. NOD-like receptors are pattern recognition receptors, representing a critical component of innate immunity, supporting the hypothesis that the gut microbiota may affect bone turnover in an immune-mediated manner.

GF mouse models have also been used to investigate the mediators of microbiota-dependent bone mass regulation. Two separate studies in GF mice have implicated the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) such as butyrate and acetate by the gut microbiota as an important mediator of bone formation [26, 27]. Based on their work in GF CB6F1 mice, Yan and colleagues propose that anabolic effects on bone following chronic colonization of GF mice (8 months) with a pathogen-free microbiota are possibly mediated by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production [27]. Additionally, antibiotic treatment of conventionally raised mice led to a reduction in circulating IGF-1 and concurrent inhibition of bone formation. Provision of SCFA to mice who received antibiotics restored IGF-1 and bone mass to levels present in mice that were not treated with antibiotics. The potential of microbial-derived SCFA, in particular butyrate, to mediate bone formation was further supported in another GF and antibiotic-treated mouse study [26]. Here, the anabolic effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH) were dependent on an intact microbiota. Strikingly, nutritional supplementation of butyrate in antibiotic-treated mice led to restoration of the ability of daily PTH injections to stimulate bone formation and increase trabecular thickness.

Antibiotics are an established effector of the human gut microbiome and when not used judiciously, can have deleterious effects on host health, including life-threatening infection with Clostridioides difficile.[28, 29] The long-term sequelae of early-life consumption of antibiotics is the subject of much interest. In the preterm infant, antibiotic use can lead to reduced intestinal species diversity and richness, in addition to long-lasting carriage of multi-drug resistant organisms [30]. Association studies indicate that antibiotic use in childhood increases the risk of developing atopy and autoimmune inflammatory disorders such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in later life [31–33].

Another potential mechanism by which alteration of the gut microbiome may affect bone health relates to the microbial synthesis and luminal availability of vitamin K2 (menaquinone). Warfarin, the widely used vitamin K antagonist, has long been associated with a small increase in the risk of osteoporotic fractures in adults [35, 36]. While vitamin K can affect bone quality through several mechanisms, the presence of vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues is crucial for osteocalcin production and bone formation [37]. Using a metagenomic-based sequencing approach, Guss and colleagues demonstrated that disruption of the gut microbiota of C57BL/6 J inbred mice by broad spectrum antibiotics (ampicillin and neomycin) led to a reduced abundance of vitamin K-producing genes within the gut microbiome (MenB, MenC, MenG). This resulted in a subsequent deterioration in bone mineral crystallinity.[38] Their work was supported by the finding of reduced availability of menaquinone within the intestine, liver and kidney of the antibiotic-treated mice. This study provides an excellent example of how metagenomic sequencing, combined with metabolite quantification in biological samples, can provide valuable insight into functional metabolic capacity and activity, allowing us to understand how the gut microbiome can affect processes relevant to bone health.

To investigate whether the gut microbiome plays a role in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis, GF mice studies have frequently been used in combination with ovariectomy or with oestrogen deficiency induced by gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH).

In summary, the data from animal studies provide evidence to support a role of the gut microbiome on the regulation of bone mass attainment and bone remodelling. The evidence also suggests that some of the effects of oestrogen deficiency on bone health are microbiota-dependent. The effects of microbiota alteration or depletion by antibiotics is less consistent and requires further study. However, caution is needed when attributing direct causation to the effects of specific microbes or microbial communities to bone formation or resorption. This is particularly true of GF animal studies, since these conditions cannot be replicated in humans and are not directly translatable [46].

Several observational studies examining the relationship between BMD and the gut microbiota have recently been published [17, 47, 48]. All of these have used 16 s ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing to analyse the gut microbiota. The largest study, published by Das et al., [17] examined variation in the gut microbiota according to BMD measurements in 181 adults; 60 with normal BMD, 61 with osteopenia and 60 with osteoporosis. The mean age of participants was 64 years and the cohort was predominantly female. Microbial diversity in the gut had previously has been show to correlate with frailty in elderly residents of residential homes [14], but did not associate with BMD in this younger cohort of community dwellers. A large number of potential confounders were recorded and after controlling for these, five taxa remained significantly different between the normal BMD and osteopenic/osteoporotic groups.

Interestingly, a study of the EPIC cohort (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) has shown an association between vegan and vegetarian diets and fracture incidence [49]. Although the researchers did not specifically interrogate the effects of these diets on the gut microbiota, this is clearly an area of research interest given the increasing popularity of vegan and plant-based diets in young, female individuals. Furthermore, in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort, observational analysis of the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and fracture incidence demonstrated that greater adherence to the diet was associated with a significant reduction in fracture risk [50]. Although, it is not possible to attribute causation to this, long-term adherence to the Mediterranean diet is known to directly impact the gut microbiota with resultant health benefits for the host [11, 51].

There have been several randomized controlled trials in humans investigating the effects of probiotic supplementation on bone health.

In summary, the available evidence suggests that probiotic supplements can attenuate bone loss in postmenopausal women, although the studies investigating this have been short term and individually have had small sample sizes. Moving forward, it will be important to conduct larger scale studies to evaluate if the skeletal response differs with different types of probiotic and also to determine of the effects are sustained in the longer term. Few human studies have examined the effect of dietary manipulation of the gut microbiota on bone health. However, candidate nutrients such as fibre and isoflavones have been identified as potential effectors [56, 58].

Vitamin D receptors are highly expressed within the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the small intestine and colon [59]. However, expression may be reduced in disorders associated with reduced gut microbiota diversity such as inflammatory bowel disease [60]. In a recent cross-sectional analysis of 567 older men, serum levels of calcitriol, the active hormone of vitamin D accounted for between 2 and 5% of the variance in the microbial diversity in the gut [61]. This investigation identified eight specific taxa, many from the phylum Firmicutes, that positively correlated with levels of calcitriol. Furthermore, participants with higher levels of circulating calcitriol were more likely to have a microbiota associated with SCFA production (butyrate), suggesting that the gut microbiota may influence vitamin D bioavailability.

The existing evidence suggests that the gut microbiome and probiotics may alter vitamin D metabolism within the gut, but research also indicates that increased oral vitamin D intake may affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Both these possibilities require further investigation given the widespread nature of vitamin D insufficiency in all age groups of the UK population.[64]

During the Royal Osteoporosis Society workshop, invited experts in the areas of osteoporosis, nutrition and microbiome research discussed the key knowledge gaps in the area of microbiome research as it applies to bone metabolism and osteoporosis. Specifically, the group considered the populations of interest, the key clinical questions to be addressed and the study designs that might be employed to advance the field (Table
1). A need for prospective, longitudinal observational studies was identified since both bone health and the gut microbiome are subject to temporal changes across the life course and the relationship between them at critical junctures of development and physiological change needs to be investigated (puberty, illness, menopause, frailty; see Fig. 2).

There are many unknowns about the effects of therapeutically administered microbes on bone. While it is important to investigate these effects, it is also salient to understand how factors such as nutrients (for example wholegrain foods and fibre), dietary patterns (for example vegetarian, vegan and mediterranean diets), medication and antibiotic use, as well as medical co-morbidities, may predispose to osteoporosis by exerting impact on the gut microbiome. Research in the microbiome field so far suggests that ‘making a good microbiome bad’ (for example by adopting a Westernized diet) is a lot easier than ‘making a bad microbiome good.’ This underlines the importance of advancing our knowledge of the impact of early life on development of the gut microbiome in relation to bone health.

The research priorities identified for progression of microbiome-osteoporosis research highlight a clear need for large, prospective observational studies with long-term follow-up. To expedite this research, utilization of existing cohorts may provide some of the required answers but in some cases microbiome data may not have been collected. Cohorts such as UK-BIOBANK and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) in the United Kingdom represent large, well-established longitudinal databases that could be useful. For interventional clinical trials that manipulate the microbiota with the intent of host benefit, a follow-up time of less than 6 to 9 months is unlikely to generate useful data, such is the time it takes for persistent, meaningful changes to be enacted upon the adult microbiota. In studies aiming to prevent complications of osteoporosis such as fractures it remains unclear what the best suggorate measure should be as primary outcomes in clinical trials. Regardless of the chosen primary outcome, we suggest that such studies incorporate a minimum of 12-month participant follow-up as has been performed previously [19].

An important consideration for all studies on the human gut microbiota, in particular association or interventional studies aimed at altering the characteristics of the microbiota, relates to the many confounding factors than can affect its composition and function. This highlights the importance of collecting data on key clinical variables that may directly affect the microbiota. These include recent antibiotic use, previous gastrointestinal surgery or illness, current medication use, smoking, alcohol intake, habitual intake of macro- and micro-nutrients, dietary supplementation, BMI and menopausal status. Adjustment for and consideration of these confounders underlines the importance of qualified biostatistical expertise and collection of sufficient and accurate metadata [71]. The availability of rich, linked metadata to microbiota sequences in data repositories is crucial to facilitate integrative, multi-study analysis across international groups and study population cohorts. We would encourage research groups to collect and submit detailed metadata and to make them available in a FAIR manner (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable).

Choice of technology to assess the microbiota composition and function is another critical consideration in microbiome research. Over the last 5 years, there has been a shift from compositional microbiome analysis using quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing. While 16S sequencing is especially useful for large-scale profiling of microbiome samples because of its low cost and robustness, the desire to increase our understanding of pathophysiology, has seen a move towards shotgun metagenomic sequencing that provides information on gene content and therefore functional “potential” of the microbiome. True functional insights can only be obtained by a combination of metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiome with other ‘omic technologies such as transcriptomics, proteomics or metabolomics, in combination with intervention studies and Mendelian Randomization studies.

With respect to dietary assessment, the ideal and most accurate method for habitual dietary recording has long been debated (such as a 7-day food diary vs. semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire). Like other recommendations in this section, the choice of dietary assessment tool depends on the hypothesis under investigation; the level of quantification required (frequency of food intake versus mass quantity of food); cost; time expended and use of the most accurate assessment tool within the context of the study design. Some research has suggested different dietary assessment methods capture distinct areas of diet-microbiome interaction, potentially arguing against a reliance on a single dietary tool [74]. The introduction of app- and web-based methods of dietary assessment, as well as emerging innovations in food image recognition and wearable technologies, promises to reduce participant burden and facilitate richer and more accurate dietary assessment. Depending on the research question at hand, it may be appropriate to consider methods for adjusting for total energy intake and energy under/over-reporting.

Understanding of how food and nutrition affect life processes is fundamental to improving health and preventing disease. With an increasing societal awareness of the gut microbiota and the continued emphasis on the impact of food and lifestyle on health, the complex interplay between nutrition, the gut microbiome and bone health is of interest to many. Methods of analysing the gut microbiome have advanced and are now well-positioned for us to investigate the mechanisms by which modern lifestyle, diet and illness exert their effects on bone health via the gut microbiome. Microbiome research offers exciting prospects for patients with osteoporosis. We believe the next decade will provide significant progress in this new field of osteo-microbiology.
