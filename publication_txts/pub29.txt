Possibilities and limits for using the gut microbiome to improve captive animal health

Because of its potential to modulate host health, the gut microbiome of captive animals has become an increasingly important area of research. In this paper, we review the current literature comparing the gut microbiomes of wild and captive animals, as well as experiments tracking the microbiome when animals are moved between wild and captive environments. As a whole, these studies report highly idiosyncratic results with significant differences in the effect of captivity on the gut microbiome between host species. While a few studies have analyzed the functional capacity of captive microbiomes, there has been little research directly addressing the health consequences of captive microbiomes. Therefore, the current body of literature cannot broadly answer what costs, if any, arise from having a captive microbiome in captivity. Addressing this outstanding question will be critical to determining whether it is worth pursuing microbial manipulations as a conservation tool. To stimulate the next wave of research which can tie the captive microbiome to functional and health impacts, we outline a wide range of tools that can be used to manipulate the microbiome in captivity and suggest a variety of methods for measuring the impact of such manipulation preceding therapeutic use. Altogether, we caution researchers against generalizing results between host species given the variability in gut community responses to captivity and highlight the need to understand what role the gut microbiome plays in captive animal health before putting microbiome manipulations broadly into practice.

In captivity, wild animals are subject to environments and lifestyles that they would not experience in their natural habitat as a result of significant human manipulation of the animals’ built environment, diet, healthcare, and social interactions [1]. These novel circumstances can lead to improved animal welfare and longevity in some species [2], but other species suffer from serious health problems under human care and human environments [2, 3]. There are diverse health problems which have been associated with captivity including issues with metabolism and digestion [4, 5], infection [6, 7], stress [8, 9], and reproduction [10, 11]. Reflecting its growing importance in other fields of organismal research, the microbiome has been proposed as a mediator of host condition under captivity [e.g. 12]. However, the extent, predictability, and drivers of microbiome changes under captivity remain unclear, limiting our ability to utilize microbial interventions to alleviate captivity-associated health problems.

In this paper, we intend to help identify and address gaps in our understanding of the captive gut microbiome and in turn host health. We review the literature on how and why the gut microbiome responds to captivity, as well as what is known about the health consequences of these changes. To conclude, we highlight major outstanding questions in the field brought to light by our review and propose priority areas for future work, with an emphasis on research relevant to conservation efforts.

The scope of captivity’s influence on the gut microbiome can be summarized with three broad questions. How does the microbiome change in response to captivity? Why does it change? And, do these changes affect overall animal health for the better or for the worse? We focus here on the gut microbiome, which has been the subject of the preponderance of work on captive microbiomes, but note that an important exception considered elsewhere [e.g. 33, 34] is the amphibian skin microbiome.

There have been more than 60 studies over recent decades characterizing the effects of captivity on the gut microbiome of host species spanning the animal kingdom. Though the term “captivity” can refer to a variety of habitats such as zoos, sanctuaries, labs, farms, or even households, most of these studies examine captivity in the context of zoos or sanctuaries and sometimes, but not always, focus on endangered species. Altogether, it is clear that there is no singular “captive microbiome,” as differences in microbial diversity and community composition between captive and wild environments vary greatly among hosts (Table
1).

A few researchers have conducted the inverse transplant experiment, tracking the microbiome as captive animals are reintroduced to the wild (Table
3). These studies provide some evidence that the captive gut microbiome shifts back to resemble the wild gut microbiome after reintroduction and can do so on the timescale of days to weeks [e.g. 49–51]. But, the observed shift back towards a wild microbiome may not completely erase microbial signatures of an animal’s captive origin, as seen in Przewalski’s horses even after 10 years post-release [22]. It is worth noting compositional shifts following reintroduction are likely highly dependent on the environment to which animals are transplanted. In addition to moving animals from captivity to the wild, Chong et al. transplanted Tasmanian Devils from one wild location to another and saw a compositional shift towards a microbiome that resembled native Tasmanian Devils of the new location [50]. The lack of a universal “wild” microbiome, even for a single species, is ubiquitous and logical given findings that some gut bacteria may be geographically restricted or fluctuate seasonally [30, 52–54].

While it is clear that transitioning between wild and captive conditions can elicit changes to the gut microbiome, the ecological factors altered under captivity that specifically cause microbiome shifts often remain unspecified. Captive diets can vary widely from natural diets [3, 55], and diet has been shown to have a strong influence over gut microbial composition in captive animals [21, 31, 51, 56]. Even minor changes in diet can lead to shifts in microbial composition, as evidenced in captive sifakas [57]. Environmental conditions beyond diet can also matter, with one study demonstrating that rehousing lab mice in a room with altered temperature and humidity, but the same diet, resulted in significant changes in gut microbial composition [49]. Additionally, microbial dispersal from abiotic environmental substrates (water, soil, plants, etc.), as well as from contact with conspecifics or other species (including humans), can influence the gut microbiome of captive animals and can vary between captive facilities [58]. Komodo dragons, for example, harbor gut microbes that are also present in their enclosures [59], while human handling has been implicated in the spread of microbes between mouse enclosures [48]. Animal social groups have a strong influence on gut microbial composition in the wild, likely affecting the microbiome by transferring bacteria between individuals through physical contact among social networks [e.g. 60–62]. It is reasonable to expect similar social dynamics transmit microbes among captive populations, although, beyond studies of cohousing [e.g. 63, 64], this is rarely explicitly considered.

Interaction with humans introduces additional stressors unique to the captive environment that can influence the microbiome. Most notably, administration of antibiotics reduces the natural flora of the gut and may even compound the effects of captivity by quickly removing large portions of the wild microbiota [66]. Isolation from natural pathogens like helminths through anthelminthic medicine or increased hygiene can induce changes to the microbiome by affecting the immune system [67, 68]. Additionally, direct physical interactions with humans, such as keepers or visitors, could both directly introduce human-associated microbes [44, 45] and cause stress, which itself can induce shifts in microbial composition [e.g. 69, 70].

While the reviewed studies clearly show that captivity can affect the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome, characterizing these two metrics is insufficient to determine whether the gut microbiome plays a role in captive animal health as they do not give insight into whether bacterial functions change [71]. To date, there have been few studies that compare functional capacity of the microbiome in the wild and in captivity in addition to composition. Of these, most have predicted functionality using reference genomes related to taxa represented in 16S rRNA gene sequencing data [e.g. 44, 72, 73] and a few have conducted functional metagenomic sequencing [e.g. 38, 40, 74, 75]. Most show that predicted function differs between captive and wild microbiomes (but see [76] for a case in which no functional difference was predicted) and argue the altered functional capacity of the bacterial community may have a realized impact on host biology. However, altered functional capacity does not necessarily indicate changes in bacterial activity or host physiology [77].

There are alternative interpretations of microbial differences between wild and captive animals that do not presume the captive microbiome is less favorable [e.g. 35, 86–88] or potentially detrimental [1]; these are important to consider in the absence of species-specific experimental evidence. First, microbiomes may have changed to match the new captive environment in a beneficial manner [89]. For example, natural selection could promote a microbiome better able to digest the captive diet while potentially reducing the animal’s capacity to digest a (no longer relevant) wild diet [21, 90]. Captive microbiome contributions to promoting growth or mitigating stressors may not fully outweigh the costs of a captive lifestyle, so captive animals may still be found to have worse health than wild individuals. Still, in these cases a return of a wild or ancestral microbiome to a captive animal would further diminish health in captivity. Second, microbiome changes under captivity may be constrained by tradeoffs such that the increase in some microbial functions, such as those relevant to captive environments, lead to the decrease or loss of other functions [77]. If so, re-establishing a wild microbiome may improve some aspects of health while reducing others. Third, the captive microbiome may be caused by, rather than causative of, poor health, in which case treating the microbiome would not alter the underlying condition. Finally, changes in the microbiome under captivity may primarily be neutral given functional redundancy of gut microbiota [91]. Given the scope of the current evidence that exists, we cannot presume to know what effect the captive microbiome has on the health of any given species. To ensure our understanding is sufficient for conservation applications, more research must be done to indicate under which circumstances and for which species microbial manipulations can improve health.

There is no single answer to the question of whether the gut microbiome matters for host health in captivity in large part because there is no single captive microbiome. The microbiome’s impact will be particular to host species, diet, external environment, conservation status, and reintroduction plans, among many other factors that impact the gut microbiome and/or affect species health priorities. Insofar as there is a prospect of health-relevant compositional and functional differences of the gut microbiome under captivity, we must identify when reconstituting a wild microbiome is most likely to be a suitable route for improving animal welfare and conservation. (Although, even absent demonstrated health benefits, there may be cases where reconstituting a wild microbiome is a worthwhile goal, for instance where it provides more ecologically realistic models for host-microbe interaction research.)

Once health links to the gut microbiome are identified for a given species, there are additional challenges in deciding whether and how to incorporate microbial manipulations into husbandry practices as this would require investments of both funding and labor at animal facilities. Again, species experts will be in the best position to balance wellness and conservation goals with the costs and challenges of microbial manipulations—particularly if functional tradeoffs are present. For example, if the captive microbiome proves beneficial in captivity but harmful when animals are reintroduced, the short-term wellbeing of an individual animal must be weighed against the long-term wellbeing of the species. To successfully reintroduce animals to the wild may require pre-seeding a wild microbiome, or pre-seeding may be an unnecessary expense if functionality recovers when the microbiome reverts to a more wild-like state on its own [22, 49–51]. It is likely that certain manipulations will be more appropriate or more costly for some species than others, and institutions such as zoos that manage a wide variety of species will likely need to employ a wide range of strategies to cope with this variation. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of harnessing the influence of the gut microbiome to improve host health is undeniable and will certainly be a worthwhile research avenue for many species.

As more species are becoming impacted by threats such as climate change, human land use, and emerging infectious diseases [109–112], finding new ways to improve animal welfare in captivity may be critical for species success through captive breeding and reintroduction programs. Much work has been done in this century to characterize the differences between gut microbial composition of captive animals and their wild counterparts. As a whole, it is clear that there is enormous variation in how species’ gut microbes respond to the captive environment. Thus, there will likely be variation in how the captive microbiome influences host health, preventing a one size fits all approach to managing animal health through the microbiome. Both captive microbiome research and eventual mitigation strategies will likely need to be handled on a species-by-species basis managed by those who are most familiar with their particular biology, but in all cases they should include broader surveys of health phenotypes that consider immune, behavioral, and reproductive health in addition to metabolic health.

This complexity raises important questions for how the field should move forward, such as what species should be prioritized for research and what aspects of host health should be optimized. For example, should we begin with species that are known to have poor health in captivity or with those that face the greatest extinction threats? And is it worth improving metabolic health in captivity if it comes at the cost of immune health or metabolic functioning in the wild? The answers to these questions will likely be influenced by logistical barriers such as species availability and population sizes, but they merit careful consideration by scientists continuing captive microbiome research. As the field moves away from characterizing microbial composition and focuses more on linking microbial function to host phenotypes, it is crucial that researchers not only consider these questions, but acknowledge the limitations of their findings to avoid recommending widespread microbial manipulations before their effects are fully understood.
