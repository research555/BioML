Dissecting the role of the human microbiome in COVID-19 via metagenome-assembled genomes

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), primarily a respiratory disease caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is often accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms. However, little is known about the relation between the human microbiome and COVID-19, largely due to the fact that most previous studies fail to provide high taxonomic resolution to identify microbes that likely interact with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we used whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing data together with assembly and binning strategies to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 514 COVID-19 related nasopharyngeal and fecal samples in six independent cohorts. We reconstructed a total of 11,584 medium-and high-quality microbial MAGs and obtained 5403 non-redundant MAGs (nrMAGs) with strain-level resolution. We found that there is a significant reduction of strain richness for many species in the gut microbiome of COVID-19 patients. The gut microbiome signatures can accurately distinguish COVID-19 cases from healthy controls and predict the progression of COVID-19. Moreover, we identified a set of nrMAGs with a putative causal role in the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and revealed their functional pathways that potentially interact with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we demonstrated that the main findings of our study can be largely validated in three independent cohorts. The presented results highlight the importance of incorporating the human gut microbiome in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease progression.

The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected billions of people world-wide. A broad range of clinical manifestations of COVID-19 has been reported, including asymptomatic or mild disease with cough and fever to severe pneumonia with multiple organ failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to death1. Existing studies found that a large proportion of COVID-19 patients had at least one gastrointestinal (GI) symptom2–5, such as diarrhea, vomiting, or belly pain. Moreover, it has been reported that, among 73 SARS-CoV-2-infected hospitalized patients in China, 53.4% of patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in their stool samples ranging from day 1 to 12 post infection6. Importantly, in more than 20% of infected patients, their fecal samples remained positive for the virus even after the respiratory and/or sputum samples exhibited no detectable virus6. In some cases, the viral load in feces is even higher than that in pharyngeal swabs3. All these results suggest that the GI tract might be an important extra-pulmonary site for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the invasion of host cells by SARS-CoV-2 via its spike protein is well-established7, and ACE2 is also highly expressed in the small intestine and colon4,8. Therefore, the prolonged presence of large amounts of fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus is unlikely to be explained by the swallowing of virus particles replicated in the throat but rather suggests enteric infection with SARS-CoV-2.

An alternative strategy to analyze WMS sequencing data is to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) through de novo assembly and binning26. One key advantage of this strategy is that it allows recovery of genomes for microorganisms that have yet to be isolated and cultured and hence are absent from the current reference genome databases. This strategy has been adopted in several studies to provide genomic insights into microbial populations that are critical to human health and disease27,28. In this study, we applied state-of-the-art metagenome assembly and binning strategies to reconstruct microbial population genomes directly from microbiome samples of COVID-19 patients and controls (Fig. 1). Our major goals were to construct a COVID-19 related metagenomic genome catalog to identify novel taxa and strain-level differences that are likely related to the clinical manifestations of SARS-COV-2 infection. Our results demonstrate the association of the human microbiome and SARS-COV-2 infection at an unprecedentedly high level of taxonomic resolution. More importantly, our study provides a unique resource to directly investigate the genomic content of COVID-19 relevant microbial strains and sheds light on more targeted follow-up studies.

To examine the relation between the human microbiome and COVID-19 via MAGs, we first gathered WMS sequencing data from the COVID-19 related human microbiome studies (publicly available as of August 2021) as the discovery cohorts. We collected the raw WMS sequencing data of 514 microbiome samples (n = 359 individuals) from six publicly available datasets (Fig. 1a and Table 1) with different technical settings (e.g., sequencing platform and sequencing depth), including nasopharyngeal (n = 96) and fecal microbiome (n = 418) samples. Among these samples in the discovery cohorts, we have 404 (78.60%) and 110 (21.40%) samples from COVID-19 patients and Non-COVID-19 controls (Fig. 2a), respectively.

To validate our key findings in the discovery cohorts, we collected the raw WMS sequencing data of 341 fecal microbiome samples (n = 278 individuals) from three publicly available datasets (Table S1, publicly available as of April 2022). In the validation cohorts, 62.46% and 37.54% microbiome samples from COVID-19 patients and Non-COVID-19 controls, respectively.

After quality control, we performed metagenomic assembly and binning on those microbiome samples from the discovery cohorts and recovered 12,195 MAGs in total (Fig. 1b). To standardize the genome quality across all datasets, we used thresholds of ≥50% genome completeness and ≤5% contamination29,30, resulting in 11,584 MAGs [mean completeness = 87.55%; mean contamination = 0.99%; mean genome size = 2.6 megabases (Mb); mean N50 = 61.8 kilobases (kb), Figs. S1, S2]. Here N50 is the sequence length of the shortest contig at 50% of the total genome length. To obtain the view of the microbial community at the species level, we first organized 11,584 MAGs into species-level genome bins (SGBs) at an ANI (average nucleotide identity) threshold of 95%, resulting in a total of 872 SGBs, of which 160 (18.35%) SGBs represented species without any available genomes from the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB)31 and were defined as unknown SGBs (uSGB, Fig. S3). To evaluate the highest quality representative genomes, we dereplicated the 11,584 MAGs at an ANI threshold of 99%, resulting in a final set of 5403 non-redundant MAGs (nrMAGs) with strain-level resolution [mean completeness = 86.87%; mean contamination = 0.99%; mean genome size = 2.4 megabases (Mb); mean N50 = 63.2 kilobases (kb), Fig. 2d, e and Fig. S2]. We found that each Non-COVID-19 microbiome sample contributed relatively higher rates of total MAGs and nrMAGs than COVID-19 microbiome samples as 21.40% Non-COVID-19 microbiome samples contributed to 31.32% of total MAGs and 38.94% of nrMAGs (Fig. 2a–c and Fig. S4).

Among those 5403 strain-level nrMAGs, 2,190 (40.53%) nrMAGs satisfied the medium-quality criteria (50% ≤ completeness < 90% and ≤5% contamination), and 3,213 (59.47%) nrMAGs showed high-quality (≥90% completeness and ≤5% contamination) (Fig. 1)29,30. Using the Genome Taxonomy Database31, 5,397 (99.89%) and 6 (0.11%) nrMAGs were assigned to bacterial and archaeal domains, respectively (Fig. S5). The phyla information of nrMAGs was summarized in Fig. 2d.

Previous studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with the alpha diversity of the human gut12,32,33 and oral34,35 microbiome at the genus- or species-level. We first investigated in our discovery cohorts whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with alpha diversity of the human microbiome at the nrMAG-level. The alpha diversity measures (i.e., Richness and Shannon index) from COVID-19 patients and Non-COVID-19 controls were compared (Fig. 3a and Fig. S6). In accordance with previous studies11,32, we found that the Richness and Shannon index of the gut microbiome in COVID-19 patients were significantly lower than that in Non-COVID-19 controls in two datasets (Zuo et al.18 and Yeoh et al.19, Fig. 3a and Fig. S6a, d). Interestingly, no significant results were found between patients with COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 Pneumonia controls (Fig. 3a and Fig. S6a). Consistent with a previous study36, we found no significant differences between COVID-19 patients and Non-COVID-19 controls in the nasopharyngeal microbiome samples (Fig. 3a and Fig. S6e, f). This may be due to the small sample size and the fact that Non-COVID-19 controls are not health controls in one of the nasopharyngeal microbiome datasets (Liu et al.36). Moreover, in the other nasopharyngeal microbiome dataset (PRJNA74398137), we only identified a small number of nrMAGs, as a large portion of sequencing reads from this dataset were contamination from the human genome. In accordance with the two discovery cohorts (i.e., Zuo et al.18 and Yeoh et al.19), we found that the alpha diversity of the gut microbiome in COVID-19 patients was overall lower than that in Non-COVID-19 controls in the validation cohorts (Fig. S7).

In the dataset from Yeoh et al.19, the gut microbiome samples from those patients with COVID-19 were collected before and after their nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-qPCR. Furthermore, patients with COVID-19 were classified into four severity groups (i.e., mild, moderate, severe, and critical) based on symptoms as reported in the previous study40. We found that patients with COVID-19 who had milder disease severity showed significant higher Shannon diversity in their gut microbiome (Fig. 3e). Interestingly, the composition of nrMAGs in patients with COVID-19 after recovery (negative for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-qPCR) were significantly different from Non-COVID-19 controls than from patients with COVID-19 before recovery (positive for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-qPCR, Fig. 3f). In line with a previous study at the metabolic capacity level41, these results indicate that the gut microbiome of patients with COVID-19 did not return to a relatively healthy status right after their recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. We then observed that disease severity of COVID-19 was significantly positively associated with the gut microbiome dissimilarity between COVID-19 patients and Non-COVID-19 controls (Fig. 3g). To understand the relation between disease severity and short-term variation in the gut microbiome of patients with COVID-19, we traced the changes in the microbiome within each individual associated with disease severity. Interestingly, patients with COVID-19 who had milder disease severity showed lower temporal variation in the gut microbiome (quantified by the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of longitudinal microbiome samples, Fig. 3h). The lower temporal variation of gut microbiome samples in milder disease severity groups is partly due to the higher fraction of common nrMAGs across the longitudinal microbiome samples in those groups (Fig. 3i).

To explore whether the strain-level diversity within the same species is related to COVID-19, we analyzed data from the two discovery cohorts (Zuo et al.18 and Yeoh et al.19) as well as the three validation cohorts (Zhang et al.41, Xu et al.39, and Li et al.22). We first grouped all the nrMAGs to the species level based on GTDB taxonomy information. For each species, we computed its strain richness (i.e., the number of its nrMAGs) for all microbiome samples. Those nrMAGs without the species annotation and species containing only one nrMAGs were excluded. Interestingly, the top-30 microbial species with the highest strain richness were highly overlapped between the discovery and validation cohorts (Fig. 4a, b, Figs. S10a-c, S11). Notably, we found that COVID-19 patients lost many strains of many microbial species when compared to Non-COVID-19 controls for both the discovery (Fig. 4c, d) and the validation cohorts (Fig. S10d-f). Moreover, those species with significant strain loss are highly overlapped between discovery cohorts (Fig. S12a), including Bariatricus comes, Blautia_A obeum, Blautia_A wexlerae, Dorea formicigenerans, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii_D, Faecalibacterium sp900539945, and Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans. Importantly, these results are highly consistent with the alpha diversity analysis at the nrMAG-level that COVID-19 patients had significantly lower number of nrMAGs identified than that of Non-COVID-19 controls on discovery cohorts (i.e., Zuo et al. and Yeoh et al.). We found that some of microbial species (9 of 30) with high COVID-19 related strain loss in the discovery cohorts were also identified in the validation cohorts (Fig. S12c). For the Xu et al.39 cohort, several species from COVID-19 patients showed significantly higher number of strains than that of Non-COVID-19 controls. This may be due to the fact that microbiome samples of COVID-19 patients (collected in 2020) and Non-COVID-19 controls (collected in 2016) were not collected and sequenced at the same time.

We next investigated the disease severity in relation to the strain diversity using data from Yeoh et al.19. We found seven species whose strain richness were positively associated with disease severity (Spearman correlation coefficients ≥ 0.9, Supplementary Data 1), including Enterocloster bolteae, Fournierella sp900543285, Hungatella effluvii, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Ligilactobacillus ruminis, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius. Moreover, a total of 222 microbial species’ strain richness were negatively correlated with disease severity (Spearman correlation coefficients ≤ −0.9, Supplementary Data 1), such as Blautia_A obeum, Bariatricus comes, Blautia_A wexlerae, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii_D.

Previous studies have demonstrated the diagnostic potential of the microbiome-based classification for SARS-CoV-2 infection using genus- or species-level taxonomic profiles12,22,42. To test whether the gut microbial composition at the nrMAG-level can distinguish COVID-19 patients from Non-COVID-19 controls, we built random forest classifiers on two datasets (Zuo et al.18: 50 patients with COVID-19 and 15 Non-COVID-19 controls; and Yeoh et al.19: 196 patients with COVID-19 and 78 Non-COVID-19 controls), separately. Importantly, this analysis was performed with 5-fold cross-validation and the data were randomly split into training and test sets 50 times. Since we had unbalanced classes, we applied two metrics to quantify the classification performance: AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and AUPRC (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve). Consistent with the PCoA analysis (Fig. 3c), using the data from Zuo et al.18, we found that nrMAGs can accurately detect COVID-19 with the mean AUROC and AUPRC values of 0.981 and 0.971, respectively (Fig. S13a). The top COVID-19 related features included multiple nrMAGs from Blautia_A sp003480185, Blautia_A wexlerae, Agathobacter faecis, Eisenbergiella sp900066775, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii_G, and Lachnospira rogosae (Fig. S13b). Consistent with the first dataset (Zuo et al.18) and the PCoA analysis (Fig. 3d), the random forest classifier on the larger cohort (Yeoh et al.19) also showed high classification performance (AUROC ∼ 0.920; AUPRC ∼ 0.884; Fig. S13c). The key discriminatory nrMAGs of COVID-19 in this cohort belonged to Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, Blautia_A sp003471165, Eisenbergiella sp900066775, Eubacterium I, Gemmiger sp900539695, and Romboutsia timonensis (Fig. S13d). Moreover, three specific nrMAGs were identified (from Mediterraneibacter_A butyricigenes and Eisenbergiella sp900066775) as common features between the two datasets.

We further tested the generalization of COVID-19 related microbiome features on the three validation cohorts (i.e., Zhang et al.41, Xu et al.39, and Li et al.22). We found that the classification models trained with the data of Yeoh et al.19 achieved an overall reasonable classification performance on those validation cohorts (Fig. S16).

We next investigated the association between nrMAGs and the progression of COVID-19. To explore this association, we employed a random forest regression model to predict the date of negative RT-qPCR result using the data from Yeoh et al.19 (with 196 microbiome samples from 100 COVID-19 patients, Fig. S17). The regression tasks were performed with 5-fold cross-validation and we then randomly split the data 50 times. Remarkably, this approach demonstrated that the dates of negative RT-qPCR result were well predicted by nrMAGs (Pearson correlation 0.425, P-value = 1e − 45, Fig. 5a). Among the top-30 (based on the percentage increase in mean squared error) most important nrMAGs (Fig. 5b), we identified multiple species such as Citrobacter freundii, Enterocloster sp900543885, Citrobacter portucalensis, Parabacteroides distasonis and Veillonella parvula. Notably, we also found some nrMAGs from well-known opportunistic pathogens including MAG02074 (Klebsiella quasivariicola43), MAG03769 (Klebsiella pneumoniae44), and MAG02080 (Escherichia coli_D45).

To further characterize the relation between the human gut microbiome and COVID-19, we applied the generalized microbe-phenotype triangulation (GMPT) method to move beyond the standard association analysis46 (Fig. 6a). Due to the availability of disease severity data, we first categorized participants from the study of Yeoh et al.19 into five different disease severity groups (i.e., Non-COVID-19 healthy controls, mild, moderate, severe, and critical). The differentially abundant nrMAGs were then calculated using ANCOM47 (with each patient’s identifier adjusted as a random effect) in the ten pair-wise comparisons. Using this approach, all pairwise differential abundance analyses yielded a total of 644 differentially abundant nrMAGs present in at least two pairwise comparisons. To understand the potential relationship between those candidate nrMAGs and COVID-19, we then calculated the Spearman correlation coefficients between the average relative abundances of nrMAGs and COVID-19 severity score (e.g., Non-COVID-19 healthy controls: 0; mild: 1; moderate: 2; severe: 3; and critical: 4) in different phenotype groups. Those differentially abundant nrMAGs with positive (or negative) Spearman correlation coefficients are potential permissive (protective) nrMAGs of COVID-19. Based on the frequency (≥6) of all pairwise comparisons (n = 10), we summarized the results from GMPT in Fig. 6b and Supplementary Data 2. This analysis identified a total of 74 nrMAGs that were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 8 permissive (Spearman correlation > 0) nrMAGs, 63 protective (Spearman correlation < 0) nrMAGs, and 3 neutral nrMAGs (Spearman correlation = 0).

We identified multiple species with highly similar genomes from those permissive nrMAGs (Fig. 6b), including Enterocloster bolteae (3 nrMAGs), Anaeroglobus micronuciformis, Hungatella effluvii (3 nrMAGs), and Enterococcus_B faecium. Consistent with previous reports that the gut microbiome of COVID-19 patients showed significant higher abundance of Enterococcus faecium compared to health controls48. Moreover, we found that the strain richness (number of nrMAGs) of two permissive species (i.e., Enterocloster bolteae and Hungatella effluvii) positively associated with disease severity (Supplementary Data 1). Among the 63 protective nrMAGs, the dominant species were Blautia_A obeum (13 nrMAGs), Bariatricus comes (9 nrMAGs), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii_D (6 nrMAGs), Blautia_A wexlerae (6 nrMAGs), Faecalibacterium sp900539945 (4 nrMAGs), Dorea longicatena_B (3 nrMAGs), Blautia_A sp003480185 (3 nrMAGs), Blautia_A sp003471165 (3 nrMAGs), Dorea formicigenerans (2 nrMAGs), Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans (2 nrMAGs), and GCA-900066135 sp900543575 (2 nrMAGs). Importantly, we found that some of these species were previously reported (including in the original study Yeoh et al.) to be decreased in patients with COVID-19 such as Blautia obeum11,19, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii18,19,41,49, and Dorea formicigenerans18,19. Notably, multiple protective species (e.g., Bariatricus comes, Blautia_A obeum, Blautia_A wexlerae, Dorea formicigenerans, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii_D, Faecalibacterium sp900539945, and Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans) lost many strains in COVID-19 patients when compared to Non-COVID-19 controls (Fig. 4c, d). And the strain richness of most protective microbial species (17/21) negatively correlated with disease severity (Supplementary Data 1). Interestingly, those protective nrMAGs also showed a similar abundance distribution between patients with COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 controls in the study of Zuo et al.18 (Fig. S18). This finding provides strain level evidence that gut microbial taxa may interact with SARS-COV-2 infection and play a potential role in disease onset and progression in COVID-19.

To understand how those permissive and protective nrMAGs identified from the study of Yeoh et al.19 may interact with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we next investigated whether the functional capacity of permissive and protective nrMAGs differ. To achieve that goal, we first annotated the genomes of permissive and protective nrMAGs using Prokka50. Then we processed the translated coding sequences using MicrobeAnnotator51 for the functional annotation and calculated the KEGG module completeness (see Methods). Here, KEGG modules are functional gene units, which are linked to higher metabolic capabilities, structural complexes, and phenotypic characteristics51. A total of 231 and 254 KEGG modules were covered by at least one genome from permissive and protective nrMAGs, respectively. Principal component analysis revealed quite different metabolic potentials between permissive and protective nrMAGs (Fig. 7a, PERMANOVA: P-value = 0.0001). The main KEGG modules (with at least 50% module completeness) of each nrMAG are summarized in Fig. S19. Notably, we identified a set of KEGG modules that differed significantly in their module completeness between permissive and protective nrMAGs (Fig. 7b). For example, permissive nrMAGs showed significantly higher completeness level at the pentose phosphate pathway (e.g., M0004 and M0006) compared to protective nrMAGs. Moreover, we found multiple microbial genomes have the potential to use this pathway (Figs. S20, 21).

To further validate the association between the pentose phosphate pathway and COVID-19, we performed functional profiling for the metagenomics sequencing samples from the two discovery cohorts with case-control experimental settings (i.e., Zuo et al.18 and Yeoh et al.19) as well as the three validation cohorts (i.e., Zhang et al.41, Xu et al.39, and Li et al.22) at the community level using HUMAnN352. Notably, we found that the abundance of pentose phosphate pathway (PENTOSE-P-PWY) in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than that in the Non-COVID-19 controls of the two discovery cohorts: Zuo et al. (Fig. S22a) and Yeoh et al. (Fig. S22b). This result is consistent with the result that the permissive nrMAGs showed significantly higher completeness level at the pentose phosphate pathway compared to protective nrMAGs. Moreover, we found that the pentose phosphate pathway also showed higher abundance in COVID-19 patients from Zhang et al. (p-value = 0.39, Fig. S22c) and Xu et al. (p-value = 0.013, Fig. S22d) in validation cohorts.

Here, we leveraged hundreds publicly available WMS sequenced samples from multiple SARS-COV-2 datasets and generated for the first time a high-quality COVID-19 related genome catalog of the human microbiome. We recovered a large genome catalog representing 11,584 MAGs and 5403 nrMAGs of the human microbiome. Through the construction of this microbial genome catalog, we were able to provide the strain-level perspective to understanding the human microbiome and COVID-19.

In summary, we present here the first construction of the genome catalog using assembly and reference free binning of metagenome in patients with COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 controls. Our findings support the close connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the human gut microbiome, and we demonstrate that the main findings of this study can be largely validated in independent cohorts. These insights into metagenomic strain-level aspects of relation in human microbiome and COVID-19 and genome context will form the basis of future studies.

We identified COVID-19 metagenomic sequencing studies from keyword searches in PubMed and online repositories (i.e., NCBI, ENA, and GSA) and by following references in meta-analyses and related microbiome studies. We included samples with publicly available raw shotgun metagenomic sequencing data (paired fastq files) and metadata indicating patients with COVID-19 or Non-COVID-19 control status. All the sequencing data were downloaded from online repositories or links provided in the original publications, but some metadata were acquired after personal communication with the authors. We did not include any studies which required additional ethics committee approvals or authorizations for access. A total of 514 and 341 microbiome samples from six discovery cohorts and three validation cohorts were analyzed in this study, respectively (Table 1 and Table S1).

Genome reconstruction of human microbiome with metagenomic sequencing data was performed with the function modules of metaWRAP (v1.3.2)78, which is a pipeline that includes numerous modules for constructing metagenomic bins. First, the metaWRAP-Read_qc module was applied to trims the raw sequence reads and removes human contamination for each of the sequenced samples. Then the clean reads from the sequencing samples were assembled with the metaWRAP-Assembly module using metaSPAdes (v3.13.0)79. Thereafter, MaxBin2 (v2.2.6)80, metaBAT2 (v2.12.1)81, and CONCOCT (v1.0.0)82 were used to bin the assemblies. The default of the minimum length of contigs used for constructing bins with MaxBin2 and CONCOCT were 1000 bp, and metaBAT2 was defaulted to 1500 bp78. Refinement of MAGs was performed by the bin_refinement module of metaWRAP78, and CheckM (v1.0.12)83 was used to estimate the completeness and contamination of the bins, and the minimum completion and maximum contamination were 50% and 10%, respectively.

All 11,584 MAGs were clustered into species-level genome bins (SGBs) at the threshold of 95% ANI using the ‘cluster’ program in dRep (v3.0.0)84. All MAGs were taxonomically annotated using GTDB-Tk (v.1.4.1)85 based on the Genome Taxonomy Database (http://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/)31, which produced standardized taxonomic labels that were used for the analysis in this study. SGBs containing at least one reference genome (or MAG) in the Genome Taxonomy Database were considered as known SGBs. And SGBs without reference genomes were considered as unknown SGBs (uSGBs)75. dRep (v3.0.0)84 was then used for dereplication of all 11,584 MAGs (≥50% genome completeness and ≤5% contamination) by two-steps. First, MAGs were divided into primary clusters using Mash86 at a 90% Mash ANI. Then, each primary cluster was used to form secondary clusters at the threshold of 99% ANI with at least 30% overlap between genomes. According to the criteria of quality evaluation by CheckM (v1.0.12)83, 5403 nrMAGs were divided into medium-quality MAGs (50% ≤ completeness < 90% and ≤5% contamination) and high-quality MAGs (≥90% completeness and ≤5% contamination).

The metaWRAP-Quant_bins module integrated with Salmon87 (v0.13.1) was used to estimate the abundance of each nrMAGs in each of the metagenomic samples (both the discovery and validation cohorts). The phylogenetic tree of the nrMAGs was built using PhyloPhlAn (v3.0.58)88. The tree was visualized using iTOL (https://itol.embl.de/)89.

The genome annotation of MAGs was first performed with Prokka (v1.13)50 using the annotate_bins module of metaWRAP78. The annotated genomes were then processed with MicrobeAnnotator (v2.0.5)51 for the functional annotation and to calculate KEGG module completeness. All proteins are searched against the curated KEGG Ortholog (KO) database using Kofamscan90; best matches are selected according to Kofamscan’s adaptive score threshold. Proteins without KO identifiers (or matches) are extracted and searched against other databases (e.g., Swissprot, curated RefSeq database or non-curated trEMBL database)51. The KO identifiers associated with all proteins in each genome (or set of proteins) are extracted, and KEGG module completeness is calculated based on the total steps in a module, the proteins (KOs) required for each step, and the KOs present in each genome. Finally, the results were compiled in a single matrix-like module completeness table for all genomes.

Functional profiling was performed using HUMANN3(v3.0.1)52. Briefly, for each microbiome sample, taxonomic profiling is used to identify detectable organisms. Reads are recruited to sample-specific pangenomes including all gene families in any detected microorganisms using Bowtie2 (v2.4.5). Unmapped reads are aligned against UniRef90 (v201901b) using DIAMOND (v2.0.15) translated search.

Microbial alpha and beta diversity measures were calculated at the nrMAGs level using vegan package (v2.5.7) in R. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots were generated with Bray–Curtis dissimilarity. Differences in microbiome compositions across different groups were tested by the permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using the “adonis” function in R’s vegan package. All PERMANOVA tests were performed with 9999 permutations based on Bray–Curtis dissimilarity. Differences between groups were analyzed using a Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test. For differential abundance analysis in GMPT (Generalized Microbe Phenotype Triangulation) pipeline46, we used ANCOM (analysis of composition of microbiomes)47, with a Benjamini–Hochberg correction at 5% level of significance, and adjusted each patient’s identifier as a random effect. Only the nrMAGs that were presented in at least 5% of samples were included. The phylogenetic tree of the permissive, neutral, and protective nrMAGs was built using PhyloPhlAn (v3.0.58)88 and then visualized using iTOL (https://itol.embl.de/)89.

To develop a model capable of distinguishing patients with COVID-19 versus Non-COVID-19 controls, we implemented Random Forest using R’ random Forest package. A custom machine learning process was conducted using features of nrMAGs with 5-fold cross validation. The data was split into a training set and a test set, with 80% of the data forming the training data and the remaining 20% forming the test set. And then we randomly split the data 50 times. The performance of the classification model was evaluated using AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and AUPRC (area under the precision-recall curve) on the test set. The importance of each feature was quantified by the Mean Decrease in Accuracy (MDA) of the classifier due to the exclusion (or permutation) of this feature. The more the accuracy of the classifier decreases due to the exclusion (or permutation) of a single feature, the more important that feature is deemed for classification of the data. We then built Random Forest regression model with 5-fold cross-validation to predict the exact date of microbiome sample collected before or after negative RT-qPCR result. We randomly split the data 50 times. The importance of each feature in the regression was quantified by percent increase in mean square error. Pearson correlation coefficient between the true and predicted date of negative RT-qPCR result was used to evaluate the performance. All statistical analysis was performed with R (version 3.6.3).
