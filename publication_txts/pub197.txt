Postoperative pain and the gut microbiome

In excess of 300 million surgical procedures are undertaken worldwide each year. Despite recognition of the prevalence of postoperative pain, and improvements in pain management techniques, poorly controlled postoperative pain remains a major unresolved challenge globally. An estimated 71% and 51% of patients experience moderate to severe pain after surgery in in-patient and outpatient settings, respectively. Inadequately controlled pain after surgery is associated with significant perioperative morbidity including myocardial infarction and pulmonary complications.

As many as 20–56% of patients develop chronic pain after commonly performed procedures such as hernia repair, hysterectomy, and thoracotomy. Traditional analgesics and interventions are often ineffective or partially effective in the treatment of postoperative pain, resulting in a chronic pain condition with related socio-economic impacts and reduced quality of life for the patient. Such chronic pain which occurs after surgery is referred to as Persistent Post-Surgical Pain (PPSP). The complex ecosystem that is the gastrointestinal microbiota (including bacteria, fungi, viruses, phage) plays essential roles in the maintenance of the healthy state of the host. A disruption to the balance of this microbiome has been implicated not only in gastrointestinal disease but also neurological disorders including chronic pain. The influence of the gut microbiome is well documented in the context of visceral pain from the gastrointestinal tract while a greater understanding is emerging of the impact on inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain (both of which can occur during the perioperative period). The gut microbiome is an essential source for driving immune maturation and maintaining appropriate immune response. Given that inflammatory processes have been implicated in postoperative pain, aberrant microbiome profiles may play a role in the development of this type of pain. Furthermore, the microorganisms in our gut produce metabolites, neurotransmitters, and neuromodulators which interact with their receptors to regulate peripheral and central sensitisation associated with chronic pain. Microbiota-derived mediators can also regulate neuroinflammation, which is associated with activation of microglia as well as infiltration by immune cells, known to modulate the development and maintenance of central sensitisation. Moreover, risk factors for developing postoperative pain include anxiety, depression, and increased stress response. These central nervous system-related disorders have been associated with an altered gut microbiome and microbiome targeted intervention studies indicate improvements. Females are more likely to suffer from postoperative pain. As gonadal hormones are associated with a differential microbiome and pre-clinical studies show that male microbiome confers protection from inflammatory pain, it is possible that the composition of the microbiome and its by-products contribute to the increased risk for the development of postoperative pain. Very little evidence exists relating the microbiome to somatic pain. Here we discuss the potential role of the gut microbiome in the aetiology and pathophysiology of postoperative pain in the context of other somatic pain syndromes and what is known about microbe-neuron interactions. Investigations are needed to determine the specific role of the gut microbiome in this type of pain which may help inform the development of preventative interventions as well as management strategies to improve patient outcome.

The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage” (IASP, 1979). This physiological/pathophysiological phenomenon serves as a protective measure against mechanical/chemical/thermal insults. How we react to pain depends on a complex mechanism embedded in a multi-compartmental system first referred to as the “neuromatrix” by Melzack, 1999, Melzack, 2005. The input of the neuromatrix consists of sensory (peripheral nervous system), affective (limbic system, etc.), and cognitive (memories, attention, etc.) elements. While output of this matrix regulates motor regions of the brain (both involuntary and voluntary), stress regulation and pain perception (Melzack, 1999).

Another feature of neuronal plasticity is the modification of the neuronal phenotype occurring after inflammation or axon damage (Woolf and Salter, 2000). Target derived growth factors and changes in gene expression are responsible for these changes. Central sensitisation can also result from disinhibition: long-lasting depression of descending inhibitory pathways. As sensitisation occurs via multiple signal molecules, inhibition of only one pathway may not be enough to eliminate sensitisation. This could explain why treatment of acute and chronic pain is so challenging in certain patients - pain is not the simple binary response to a noxious stimulus produced by a “wire network” but a complex and plastic process whereby multiple changes determine the net gain of the system (Latremoliere and Woolf, 2009).

Persistent Post-Surgical Pain (PPSP) can affect as many as 10–50% of patients undergoing breast, cardiothoracic, limb amputation or inguinal hernia surgery (Neil and Macrae, 2009). Severe, debilitating pain can occur in 2–10 percent of these patients (Kehlet et al., 2006). As these procedures are commonly performed, the socio-economic impact is also significant (Gan et al., 2014).

The prevention and treatment of persistent postsurgical pain are beyond the scope of this article. Minimally invasive and “nerve sparing” surgical techniques, preventive analgesia and novel pharmacological approaches (alpha-2-delta ligands (Burke and Shorten, 2010), alpha-2-adrenergic agonists, ketamine, intravenous lidocaine (Grigoras et al., 2012), corticosteroids, mexiletine, venlafaxine, etc.) (Chaparro et al., 2013) have become widely applied to decreasing the risk of pain persistence after surgery.

Neuropathic pain is the consequence of the injury / dysfunction of the nervous system and it is always maladaptive (Cohen and Mao, 2014). Amongst those people suffering from chronic pain (25–30% in Europe), the prevalence of neuropathic pain is approximately 20%, imposing a significant socio-economic burden on the society (Cruccu and Truini, 2017, Leadley et al., 2012). Symptoms of neuropathic pain differ in character compared to those of nociceptive pain. Neuropathic pain is usually described as electric-like, stabbing or lancinating; commonly associated with sensory deficits (numbness or tingling) and autonomic signs. Hypersensitivity, allodynia and unpredictable exacerbations are common (Cohen and Mao, 2014).

Acute and persistent post-surgical pain (see below) are often accompanied by a neuropathic component (Takenaka et al., 2020). This can be related to any of the above mentioned pathophysiological processes, but nerve injury specific to an anatomical location (e.g. pelvic or thoracic surgery) or multiple surgeries is certainly a contributory element (Park et al., 2018)

The practice of peripheral nerve blockade (PNBs) has increased greatly since the widespread utilisation of the ultrasound in the mid 2000s (Marhofer et al., 2010). However, with the increase in practice of PNBs, studies have indicated certain shortcomings (Abdallah et al., 2015, Harsten et al., 2013, Henningsen et al., 2018). One of these is rebound pain (RP) which may occur in as many as 40% of patients who undergo PNB (Lavand'homme, 2018). Williams and colleagues defined RP as a “quantifiable difference in pain scores when the block is working, versus the increase in acute pain that is encountered during the first few hours after the effects of perineural local anaesthetics resolve” (Williams et al., 2007-Jun;32(3):186–92.). RP has also been described as “a very severe pain when PNB wears off” (Lavand'homme, 2018).

Currently, there is no specific treatment for rebound pain. Opiates appear to be ineffective (Dada et al., 2019). Clinicians are required to balancing the risks and benefits of regional techniques and to provide thorough and information to their patients.

Over the last three decades, the proportion of all surgery which is performed on an ambulatory basis has increased substantially; in the US more than 60% of surgical procedures are performed on outpatients (Weiser et al., 2016). In developed countries, the proportion of surgical procedures performed on an ambulatory basis continues to increase. The most common complication of day case surgical procedures is postoperative pain, which can result in delayed discharge, increase the needs for medical advice after discharge (phone or unplanned physician visit) and for hospital readmission (Pogatzki-Zahn et al., 2017).

The challenge of identifying those patients who are most at risk of uncontrolled postoperative pain has compelled researchers and clinicians to examine the complex mechanism of postoperative pain and to attempt to develop new treatment strategies. The gut microbiome has been linked to several of the risk factors and mechanisms implicated in developing PPSP (O'Mahony et al., 2017, Rea et al., 2017). Hence, an aberrant microbiome profile which promotes inflammation, stress-related behaviour and pain enhancement may be a novel risk factor for this type of pain. It is tempting to suggest that determining a predictive microbiota signature of PPSP prior to surgery might open up new therapeutic avenues to prevent PPSP.

The gut microbiome is the community of 100 trillion microorganisms including bacteria, archaea, yeast, helminth parasites, and viruses that inhabit our gut (Codagnone et al., 2019) and there is sufficient evidence now that this community of microorganisms contributes to our overall health and well-being (Lynch and Pedersen, 2016). The total number of genes within our microbiome is about 100 times that of our human genome (Tremlett et al., 2017) providing some indication of the power of this ecosystem in host-microbe interactions. Our microbiome is involved in essential functions within the body such as protection from pathogens, host nutrient metabolism, production of vitamins, xenobiotic and drug metabolism, maintenance of structural integrity of the gut mucosal barrier and modulation of the immune system (Valdes et al., 2018). Shaping of the composition of our microorganisms largely begins at birth and several factors influence which microbiota take up residence. These include the mode of delivery, with vaginally and caesarean section born children have divergent microbiota profiles for up to three years of life (Shao et al., 2019). Diet, both during infancy, whether a baby is breast fed or formula fed (Clarke et al., 2014) and adulthood (Dash et al., 2015). Medications such as antibiotics or stress during early life also impact on the microbiota that colonise the gastrointestinal tract (Clarke et al., 2014).

Although the role of the gut microbiome is well appreciated in the context of visceral pain from the gastrointestinal tract, their involvement in other types of pain such as inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain, migraine, and opioid tolerance is only recently being recognised. Furthermore, the evidence for the involvement of the gut microbiota in pain following surgery is scarce with virtually no investigations into the predictive capacity of the composition and diversity of the microorganisms within our gut in the development of postoperative pain. Yet the mechanisms of pain and microbiome interactions gleaned from studies on other pain types can potentially be translated to the development of PPSP also.

Studies in both animals and humans show that the microbiome-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional signalling network linking the brain and the gut microbiota, via various neural, neurotransmitter and molecular signalling mechanisms, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), tryptophan metabolism, cortisol, and immune factors (Cryan et al., 2019). Appropriate functioning of this axis is fundamental to the reciprocal host-microbe relationship.

As the number of disorders with an altered gut microbiota increases this also implicates aberrant signalling pathways within the microbiome gut brain axis in these diseases which include disorders associated with altered responses to acute and chronic stress, altered nervous system functioning, and exacerbated gut inflammation disorders (Cryan et al., 2019). This highlights the microbiome gut brain axis as potential target for the development of novel therapeutics.

The products of bacteria including neurotransmitters, metabolites as well as constitutive elements of our gut microbiome are capable of activating nociceptors (Defaye et al., 2020). Pain manifests in different forms with one type being inflammatory pain, such as arthritic pain, which affects a substantial percentage of people world-wide (Boer et al., 2019). A decrease in pain threshold and increase in pain response are seen in inflammatory conditions with mediators such as adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), H+, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1beta (IL-1β), C–C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) being released from immune cells (Guo et al., 2019). Hyperalgesia is the enhanced response to a noxious stimulus while allodynia is pain following a non-noxious stimulus, both of which are associated with inflammation. Inflammatory mediators activate or sensitise peripheral nociceptors and may lead to somatic pain hypersensitivity (Cunha et al., 1999). Following this release of mediators, activation downstream signalling pathways occurs which induces phosphorylation in certain receptors and ion channels of first order sensory neurons which can result in peripheral sensitisation (Guo et al., 2019).

Neuropathic pain is also induced by peripheral nerve trauma which can be studied in the pre-clinical setting using the rat model of spared nerve injury (SNI). Using this model, it was noted that an altered gut microbiota composition was associated with anhedonia behaviour in susceptible compared to sham-operated rats or resilient rats (Yang et al., 2019). Anhedonia is a symptom of depression which is often associated with neuropathic pain in patients (McWilliams et al., 2003). It was possible to transfer pain and anhedonia behaviours via microbiota to antibiotic-treated pseudo-germ-free rodents. Furthermore, transplantation of microbiota from the anhedonia resilient rats into significantly improved pain and depression-like phenotypes, including anhedonia (Yang et al., 2019). This study highlights the intertwined relationship of pain, gut microbiome and mental illness suggesting that gut microbiota may be a promising target for improving neuropathic pain management particularly in the context of stress-related co-morbidities.

Probiotic bacterial species can modulate the composition of the gut microbiota to prevent or improve symptoms of such conditions as inflammatory bowel disease. Such beneficial effects occur as a result of the improved gut epithelial barrier function, cytokine production or specific effects on host biological pathways affected by certain bacterial populations (Quigley, 2019). The development of a probiotic to improve peri-operative analgesia would require empiric evidence of an association between particular gut microbiome characteristics (composition, diversity, abundance) with improved clinical outcome or identification of particular host pathways (e.g. serotonin or endocannabinoid) which may be amenable to the influence of microbiome composition. Limited amounts of both categories of evidence exist currently; for the most part it has been acquired using animal models or through secondary outcomes of observational clinical trials. For instance, abundance of specific bacterial species in the gut microbiome are associated with symptom severity in chronic pelvic pain syndrome (Shoskes et al., 2016). Prebiotic and probiotic administration have decreased visceral hypersensitivity in pre-clinical models (Luczynski et al., 2017, Verdu et al., 2006). Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 702,258 administration increases endocannabinoid levels in the liver and epididymal adipose tissue of mice (Patterson et al., 2017) potentially identifying a mechanism of anti-nociceptive action of probiotic bacteria. We suggest that justification exists to explore the potential for development of a pre/probiotic/synbiotic/post-biotic in a targeted fashion for the purpose of meeting the above criteria and thereby improving the quality of perioperative analgesia and comfort.

Much of the studies on the gut microbiome and surgery focus on surgery associated with the GI tract. An elegant review by Guyton and Alverdy (2016) provides a comprehensive view of the implications of GI surgery on the microbiome as well as the potential for the gut microbiota profile to lead to post-GI-surgical complications (Guyton and Alverdy, 2017). Despite the paucity of studies of the microbiota and general surgery and vice versa many common interventions that are a necessary part of GI surgery also apply to all types of surgery. These include for example the administration of antibiotics to prevent post-operative infection. Most commonly used are intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and oral nonabsorbable antibiotics, these have a substantial impact on the GI microbiome and have lasting effects (Guyton and Alverdy, 2017, Francino, 2015). While antibiotics are a necessary precaution the gut microbiome plays key roles in the host’s resistance to infection, competitively excluding both endogenous and exogenous pathogens (Sassone-Corsi and Raffatellu, 2015) hence modification of the microbiome can also have implications for infection. Moreover, the gut microbiome is a key driver of the local and systemic immune systems and reduction in the host microbial community increases the risk of pathogen infection, and the overgrowth of harmful pathobionts (Kamada et al., 2013).

Moreover, while there is very little data or recommendations for pre-operative microbiota targeted strategies to maintain and promote a healthy, resilient gut microbiome further research is warranted given the impact of the numerous pre-operative interventions as well as surgery itself on the gut microbiome which is now being highlighted as playing a role in many systems essential to successful recovery after surgery.

Whilst evidence on the role of the gut microbiome in different types of pain has been reviewed very nicely elsewhere (Defaye et al., 2020, Guo et al., 2019) no data or publications exist for the role of the gut microbiome in the development of post-operative pain. Yet the pathways and mechanisms associated with other types of pain are common to this type of pain also. What is intriguing is the drivers of susceptibility to develop post-operative pain and whether the gut microbiota is among these. The gut microbiome as described above is capable of producing many different mediators and metabolites which when in balance contribute to homeostasis and a healthy functioning host. An imbalance in the gut microbiota composition and hence microbiome gut brain axis signalling may influence the response to surgery, or the interventions associated with surgery and could potentially drive this increased susceptibility in the development of post-operative pain. Both direct and indirect interactions occur between the microbiota and the nervous system allowing commensal bacteria and pathogens to influence sensory neurons.

Indirect interactions involve activation of the immune response and it is well accepted that upon pathogen detection by the host a rapid immune defensive response is initiated (Defaye et al., 2020, McCusker and Kelley, 2013). Neuro-immune interactions are pivotal in pain whereby the immune system releases a number of key mediators that are capable of nociceptive sensitisation (Chen et al., 2020). Nociceptors differ from other primary sensory neurons as they can become activated in response to noxious or potentially damaging stimuli (Chen et al., 2020). The cell bodies of primary nociceptors are in the dorsal root ganglia as well as the trigeminal ganglia (Lee and Neumeister, 2020) and afferent neurons project to peripheral tissues including viscera, joints, skin and muscle (Lee and Neumeister, 2020). Molecular sensors located at the primary afferent terminals detect physical stimuli such as mechanical injury and noxious temperatures (heat and cold), but are also capable of detecting a plethora of inflammatory mediators (Lee and Neumeister, 2020). Molecular sensors expressed on nociceptors include but are not limited to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), transient receptor potential channels (e.g. TRPA1, TRPV1) sodium channels (e.g. Nav1.7 and Nav1.8), and mechanoreceptors (e.g. Piezo channels) (Ji et al., 2014).

The immune response is activated once pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognised which are localised to the surface of the microorganisms. These cell-wall constituents are relatively conserved in microorganisms including viral and bacterial nucleic acids, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), lipoproteins (Medzhitov, 2007)as well as on flagellin (Kumar et al., 2009). The recognition of PGN, a major constituent of the cell walls of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, by TLRs, on macrophages, for example (Wolf and Underhill, 2018)initiates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of other immune cells such to the site of infection (Defaye et al., 2020). Both LTA, a component of gram-positive bacteria (Wolf and Underhill, 2018) and LPS, a component of gram-negative bacteria are both recognised by TLRs, TLR2 and TLR4 respectively (Lu et al., 2008). LPS induces activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) as well as transcription factors such as nuclear factor -κB (NF- κB) which leads to an inflammatory cascade pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Kawai and Akira, 2010). Other contributors to microorganism-induced inflammatory induction include N-formyl peptides via formyl peptide receptors and bacterial flagellin via TLR5 (Defaye et al., 2020). In this way these bacterial components, once recognised by the host immune system, have an indirect impact on pain manifestation but other factors may contribute to the degree of pain. LPS for example has been established as playing a role in inflammatory pain (Hijma et al., 2020). We have previously shown that a genetic predisposition to stress compromised the coordinated CNS response to this peripheral immune activation with a blunted pain response (O'Mahony et al., 2013). Hence, despite the well-established mechanisms of inflammatory induced pain due to microorganisms there are more factors that play a role in this type of pain manifestation.

It has also been shown that bacterial cells produce both constitutive and secreted molecules that are capable of directly activating nociceptive signalling by altering the intrinsic excitability of nociceptive neurons, in the DRG for example (Ochoa-Cortes et al., 2010). Receptors, such as TLR4, which can detect bacterial cell-wall LPS are expressed on DRG neurons (Acosta and Davies, 2008). LPS directly induced sensitisation of TRPV1-mediated capsaicin responses in trigeminal sensory neurons via TLR4 in vitro has also been seen as an example of direct interactions between microbes of sensory neurons (Diogenes et al., 2011). LPS can also activate TRPA1 channels on sensory neurons, without TLR4, leading to neurogenic inflammation. These channels are expressed on extrinsic afferents, enteric neurons and non-neuronal enterochromaffin cells in the gut (Lai et al., 2017) and are more sensitive to LPS than TRPV1 receptors. Another bacterial component that has mechanisms in place to activate sensory neurons are flagellin. These are recognised by TLR5 and NLR family CARD domain-containing protein 4 (NLRC4) with TLR5 being expressed on DRG neurons providing an opportunity for bacterial flagellin to modulate pain signalling (Defaye et al., 2020). Furthermore, it was seen that the capsular polysaccharide A of Bacteroides fragilis was sufficient, without the presence of the entire bacteria, to activate sensory neurons (Defaye et al., 2020), shedding light on the significance of an imbalance in the gut microbiota allowing a prevalence in certain species and the development of pain.

This highlights that a different gastrointestinal bacterial profile can determine a host’s response to immune challenges and perhaps influence postoperative outcomes including the development of postoperative pain. A more thorough understanding of the mechanisms of direct and indirect interactions between the gut microbiome and sensory neurons is required to uncover novel therapeutic targets to inform therapeutic strategies for postoperative pain.

Despite clear and substantial inadequacies, there have been no fundamental improvements in the efficacy of postoperative pain management over the past decade. Of the greater than 300 million patients who undergo surgery each year, 30–80% report moderate to severe pain in the first few days postoperatively (Meissner and Zaslansky, 2019). Much of the work in this field has arisen from improved understanding of the relevant pathophysiology and clinical evidence relating to optimisation of existing therapies or has been driven by alterations in the type of surgery being conducted. A multitude of biological changes result from surgery, including inflammation and nerve injury which manifest clinically as acute and persistent pain. Although promising targets such as nerve growth factor and Nav 1.7 have been identified, to date, no new agents with clinical utility have been delivered (McKelvey et al., 2013). Likewise, epigenetics appears to offer strong potential to modify acute and persistent pain after surgery, and the transition from one to the other, although no therapy has yet resulted (Buchheit et al., 2012, Lirk et al., 2015). Measurable improvements in the quality and consistency of perioperative analgesia have been achieved through refined practice of existing techniques such as ultrasound guided regional anaesthesia and continuous wound infusion. Much clinical research has examined the development of improved block techniques or infusion regimens for specific clinical situations with some of these improving analgesic outcome in small but worthwhile increments. Continuous infusion of local anaesthetic to provide long lasting blockade of an anatomical field, plexus, or peripheral nerve have been increasingly studied for benefit after various types of surgery. To date, definitive clinical trials of their efficacy and safety are few, which has limited their widespread uptake in clinical practice (Ilfeld, 2017). In general, the relative benefits of continuous local anaesthetic infusion techniques versus alternatives such as the use of liposomal bupivacaine, and peripheral nerve stimulation remain to be determined. Similarly, many long-established drugs have been “redeployed” for use in perioperative analgesia: these include corticosteroids (De Oliveira et al., 2011), intravenous lidocaine (Grigoras et al., 2012), NMDA antagonists such as ketamine (Laskowski et al., 2011); and the gabapentanoids (Mishriky et al., 2015)and alpha 2 agonists(Blaudszun et al., 2012). Overall, the practice of perioperative analgesia during the past decade is notable for the absence a major advance.

While the notion of pre-operative assessment and modulation of the gut microbiome to improve postoperative outcome is an exciting possibility a substantial amount of further research is required in order to determine the role and mechanisms of the gut microbiome in this type of pain. These future studies will inform the development of microbiome targeted interventions as well as management strategies to improve patient outcome.
