Nurturing the Early Life Gut Microbiome and Immune Maturation for Long Term Health

Early life is characterized by developmental milestones such as holding up the head, turning over, sitting up and walking that are typically achieved sequentially in specific time windows. Similarly, the early gut microbiome maturation can be characterized by specific temporal microorganism acquisition, colonization and selection with differential functional features over time. This orchestrated microbial sequence occurs from birth during the first years of age before the microbiome reaches an adult-like composition and function between 3 and 5 years of age. Increasingly, these different steps of microbiome development are recognized as crucial windows of opportunity for long term health, primarily linked to appropriate immune and metabolic development. For instance, microbiome disruptors such as preterm and Cesarean-section birth, malnutrition and antibiotic use are associated with increased risk to negatively affect long-term immune and metabolic health. Different age discriminant microbiome taxa and functionalities are used to describe age-appropriate microbiome development, and advanced modelling techniques enable an understanding and visualization of an optimal microbiome maturation trajectory. Specific microbiome features can be related to later health conditions, however, whether such features have a causal relationship is the topic of intense research. Early life nutrition is an important microbiome modulator, and ‘Mother Nature’ provides the model with breast milk as the sole source of nutrition for the early postnatal period, while dietary choices during the prenatal and weaning period are to a large extent guided by tradition and culture. Increasing evidence suggests prenatal maternal diet and infant and child nutrition impact the infant microbiome trajectory and immune competence development. The lack of a universal feeding reference for such phases represents a knowledge gap, but also a great opportunity to provide adequate nutritional guidance to maintain an age-appropriate microbiome for long term health. Here, we provide a narrative review and perspective on our current understanding of age-appropriate microbiome maturation, its relation to long term health and how nutrition shapes and influences this relationship.

The first 1000 days, roughly from conception to the child’s second birthday, represent a series of critical windows of opportunities for healthy development and long-term health. During this period important foundations for immediate and long-term health are built. Human biology is driven by interaction and communication processes including those from and to our abiotic and biotic environment. Among the latter, the diversity and abundance of different microbes are a key element. A distinctive microbial community present in a defined habitat and their activity is generally referred to as microbiome. It is composed of the microbiota, an assembly of microorganisms such as bacteria, archaea, protozoa, fungi and algae along with the products of their activity, such as microbial components, metabolites and mobile genetic elements (e.g., transposons, phages) all embedded in a specific habitat [1]. Most importantly, the microbial activities within a community, their interactions among them and with their host habitat drive the dynamics and establishment of a stable ecology. While the critical importance of the gut microbiome for health has been recognized for at least a century with the groundbreaking work of Metchnikoff [2], only recent years saw an increasing appreciation of the critical window represented by the highly dynamic maturation of the infant gut microbiome. Lessons to this end stem primarily from associations seen in case–control observational studies and from clinical observations that involve early life microbiome disruptors (e.g., antibiotics) and modulators (e.g., nutrition). The extent to which microbiome changes have a causal link to the observed developmental and health outcomes requires mechanistic insight in the clinical setting or substantiation using preclinical models such as gnotobiotic animals (transfer of infant microbiota) to replicate clinical phenotypes.

Figure 1 provides a general overview on microbiome-relevant determinants and features at different stages during development in relation to immune development and nutrition.

The exposure to microbiome elements begins prenatally through maternal microbial components and metabolites. However, if and to what extent the fetus is exposed to life microbes, challenging the paradigm of a sterile womb, is highly debated [10,11]. Exposure of the normally developing fetus to metabolites and components, possibly including DNA yet only sparsely found, from the maternal microbiome is plausible, while exposure to life microbes is not. During gestation, microbial metabolites affect the developing fetus as suggested by different studies. For example, intake of a poor and inadequate diet characterized by high sugar and low fiber content, likely affecting the gut microbiome, was associated with a higher risk for severe viral respiratory infections in infants [12]. It is not established whether these effects were due to an in utero priming through microbial metabolites or to an inadequate seeding of microbes from mother to infant. In another study focusing on preeclampsia condition, the microbially produced maternal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) acetate was linked to fetal plasma acetate and regulatory T-cell development with lasting postnatal effects [13]. In concordance with this study, gestational carriage of Prevotella copri, an acetate producing microbe, is strongly linked to a decreased risk of infant food allergy manifestation independent of infant Prevotella copri carriage [14]. Of note, different clades of Prevotella copri are described and their presence in populations with a Westernized lifestyle seems strongly reduced [15]. Possibly, such Prevotella copri clade diversity informs as to why in some studies Prevotella copri has been related to inflammatory conditions while in other studies it was linked with health promoting effects [16]. These observations may partly be due to different microbial component exposure in utero and to dysbiotic microbiota seeding at birth. As recently shown in mice, higher maternal SCFA (e.g., acetate) was shown to reduce the allergy risk of their offspring mediated through regulatory T-cell expansion and function [17]. Similarly, in a rodent model, maternal intake of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands reduces postnatal TLR4 signaling in pups and thereby protects from NEC [18]. Microbial metabolites such as indole-lactate derived from tryptophan can activate AHR, indicating that maternal microbial metabolites may also influence neonatal gut immune compartments through AHR signaling. At birth, the microbiome-host interaction intensifies and becomes more direct with the initiation of a bona fide microbial colonization of the infant [19,20,21]. At delivery, the microbiologically essentially sterile infant is exposed to a multitude of microbes from the mother and the environment. In the context of microbiome inheritance, it is important to note that significant maternal gut microbiota changes were reported to occur over pregnancy, such as an expansion of some taxa, such as Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, as well as a higher interindividual diversity [22] towards the third trimester, in line with the physiological changes and adaptions in immune function. Interestingly, women’s diet during pregnancy relates to some extent to the observed microbial communities in their infant when vaginally delivered, highlighting the importance of vertical microbiota transmission [23]. Primarily, the infant gut is colonized by maternal gut and skin microbes, during birth and breastfeeding, with additional microbial input from the environment including siblings, father and other household members [19,24,25,26].

The intestinal barrier built of mucus and underlying epithelial cells is primarily considered a physical barrier contributing together with numerous immune defense components, including secretory IgAs and defensins, to modulate the microbiome and host relationship. The physicochemical properties of the mucous barrier are largely driven by the abundance of diverse glycan structures [31]. Developmental changes in glycosylation patterns on mucosal surfaces are expected to guide microbiome maturation including mucous-associated microbes that potentially interact closest with the developing gut and immune system [32]. Specific microbes dwell on glycans exposed on mucous, which can be considered as feeding from inside, as opposed to feeding through diet, and this mechanism may greatly contribute to establishing an appropriate gut ecology.

Appreciation of the importance of the microbiome in immune system development stems mainly from observations related to microbiome risk factors or perturbations. These can be exogenous factors, such as inadequate microbial component exposure during gestation, Cesarean (C)-section birth and antibiotic exposure, or endogenous conditions, such as gut developmental immaturity due to premature birth [33,34,35,36,37].

Since microbiome–host immune system interactions in early life dictate long-term immune functionality [53], it is a highly conceivable postulate that the right symbionts need to colonize the intestine at the right time. Recently, an epidemiologic study described higher gut microbiota maturity below 10 weeks of age and lower gut microbiota maturity above 30 weeks of age as risks for atopic dermatitis [27]. Whether the ‘right’ symbiont or commensals can generally be described through their taxonomy or functional capacity needs to be established. A timely choreography of microbial colonization ensures that microbiota-derived signals do not overwhelm the developing immune system in early life and that these signals can be interpreted correctly for the development of both the innate and adaptive immune system. In parallel, the intestinal T cell compartment in neonates is characterized by high levels of suppressive regulatory T cells (as opposed to adults) to control immune responses and maintain gut immune homeostasis [54]. Ultimately, what we define as an immature immune system during neonatal life [55] may in fact be the result of the orchestrated co-development of the microbiota and immune system with both key components being in synchrony.

Given the co-development of the microbiome and the immune system, it is paramount that microbial-derived signals are interpreted correctly by gut epithelial sensor cells and the immune system. To this purpose, innate immune cells use a diversity of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize conserved molecular patterns of microbes and these receptors are also expressed in a timely manner [56,57]. PPRs include Toll-like receptors (TLR), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors and leptin-like receptors. Signaling of these receptors may then act as developmental triggers for the gut microbiome.

Additionally, different specialized sensor cells are interspersed in the gut epithelia. Among them are enteroendocrine and Tuft cells. These sensor cells have multiple functions, such as local regulatory roles for gut function, systemic regulation of metabolism and food intake, for example. Recently, thanks to single cell gene expression analysis, Tuft cells regained interest as they specifically express several receptors and pathways relevant for immune regulation [69,70,71,72]. For instance, the specific Tuft cell succinate receptor SUCNR1 (GPR91) through which the microbially produced succinate triggers a type two immune response also leads to the expansion of mucus producing Paneth cells [73]. Interestingly, the highest level of succinate in stool is reported in the first 6 months of age [74]. The role of Tuft cells as immune sentinels in early life to shape the developing immune system remains to be studied in detail. An important role may be expected in view of the microbiome communities that change rather dramatically over the first postnatal year.

Given the impact of the host microbiome in guiding immune system functionality, it is critical for the host to ‘learn’ how to tolerate the microbiome. While it is abundantly evident that early events of the microbiota-immune system co-development sets the stage for immune imprinting, maintaining this symbiosis provides the foundation to sustain health throughout life.

Overall, these data add to the concept that an established mutualism with the microbiome primes the host immune system to be ready for a pathogen encounter and appropriate immune competence development. The extent to which fighting or feeding the microbiome by endogenous as well as exogenous factors directs the establishment of a mutually beneficial relationship warrants to be understood as an important basis to design meaningful preventive and corrective interventions.

As mentioned before, the early life microbiome changes rapidly and dramatically in the first years of life, reflecting to some extent the infant’s development. Hence, the quest is to characterize an appropriate gut microbiome maturation profile that starts with a rather limited number of taxa during the first months after birth and then expands to reach a richer and eventually more stable microbiome community after about 3 to 5 years [27,29,91,92,93,94]. Different metrics can be used to describe and characterize this dynamic process.

Timely progression is characteristic of the microbiome maturation, and it is conceivable that passing too fast, too slow or not at all through a specific microbiome ecology influences subsequent dynamics. The first indications to this end were observed using microbiota age in relation to atopic dermatitis [27]. Lastly, interdependence and interactions between different microbes and the infant host affect the microbiome dynamics and ecology in the gut. Network analysis of covarying microbiome features is one approach to capture microbial dynamics [95]. Integration of infant host parameters in such models may be one way forward to further establish the mechanistic underpinning of the microbiome-host interactions for appropriate development and health. Lastly, nutrition and dietary patterns need to be integrated as major modulators of the gut microbiome maturation.

Adequate infant feeding is key for healthy growth and development. The WHO and UNICEF recommend an early initiation of breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth; exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, continued breastfeeding until 2 years of age or beyond, with complementary diet introduced no later than 6 months of age [110]. While those recommendations have been adopted globally, about 60% of infants are still not breastfed in the first hour, and two in three infants are not exclusively breastfed for the recommended first 6 months [110].

Deviations from appropriate nutrition and recommendations may represent important risks for an age-appropriate microbiome development and maturation. This seems particularly relevant for recognized microbiome modulators such as dietary fibers. Their definition has evolved over the years and is subject to slightly nuanced definitions around the world. Yet, all contain the basic notion that dietary fibers are non-digestible carbohydrates and lignins, including all carbohydrate components occurring in foods that are non-digestible in the human small intestine and pass into the large intestine [121]. The recommended amount of fiber intake varies from country to country and ranges for adults from 18 to 38 g/day [121]. The reference intake in infants 6 to 12 months is 5 g/day [122]. Although the average dietary fiber intake in 6–12-month-old US infants increased over the years, from 5.3 g/day in 2002 to 6.5 g/day in 2016 [123], there are still over 25% of children below the recommended amount [124]. In China, the mean intake of fiber was reported as 2 g/day, much lower than the recommendation [125]. In 1–2-year-old toddlers, dietary fiber intake is about 10 and 5 g/day in the US and China, respectively [124,125]. However, due to the increased recommended adequate intake of 19g/day, over 80% of toddlers do not reach the recommendation in the US, China and Mexico [126,127]. Such dietary recommendations and especially the realities of infant and toddler diets regarding adequate intake need to be considered when investigating the early life microbiome development and maturation and their relation to health conditions.

Breast milk generally provides the reference nutrition for all infants, and exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months is recommended. The feeding mode, exclusive or partial breastfeeding versus no breastfeeding during early infancy, has well-recognized effects on the gut microbiome composition and function [99]. Hence, the health benefits observed for breastfed infants may partly be explained by a more appropriate gut microbiome maturation. Among those benefits are protection against infections, increased intelligence as well as probable reductions in becoming overweight and diabetes development later in life, while the situation for allergies such as asthma and atopies needs more clarification [128]. Breastfeeding, in particular when exclusive, leads to a higher abundance of bifidobacteria and lesser predominance of Enterobacteriaceae as well as lower alpha diversity compared to formula-fed infants [24,92,129,130].

The composition of consumed infant formula has also been shown in numerous observational cohort studies and randomized controlled trials to have a considerable impact on the microbiome. Among infants observed from birth to 8 months of age, a soy formula was associated with a diminished abundance of bifidobacteria and higher alpha diversity, in comparison to a cow’s milk-based formula [129]. A small study comparing older 12- to 24-month-old infants fed rice, soy and cow’s milk-based formulas showed a decreased abundance of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium species associated with feeding a plant-based formula [131]. However, this observation may have been confounded by a suspected cow milk protein allergy, a primary reason to have used a plant-based formula. The addition of individual human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) in starter infant formula resulted in a gut microbiome composition closer to that of breastfed infants with an increased abundance of Bifidobacterium species [132]. The HMO-driven microbiome community at 3 months of age was associated with a reduced risk of infections, as seen by the reduced need for antibiotics up to 12 months of age. This indicated that, indeed, a nutritionally modified early life microbiome maturation can impact later health. Other oligosaccharides such as bovine milk-derived galactooligosaccharides (GOS), for example, added to infant formula also showed a robust effect on the gut microbiome, increasing primarily bifidobacteria [133,134]. Most studies testing the effect of probiotics show more modest effects on the gut microbiome compared to prebiotics. However, studies in preterm and Cesarean section delivered infants found more pronounced effects [135,136]. Supplementation with a probiotic Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis in breastfed infants resulted in a higher abundance of the supplemented strain and an altered gut ecology [137].

Cessation of breastfeeding and introduction of complementary foods drive rather rapid and substantial changes in the infant gut microbiome [24,29]. Even though the introduction of complementary foods clearly remodels the gut microbiome, the knowledge on how particular foods and nutrients impact the developing microbiome is rudimentary and fragmented. Only a few longitudinal as well as cross sectional cohort studies examined associations between dietary intake and the gut microbiome with some evidence coming from intervention studies with prebiotics and probiotics. Intervention studies evaluating the impact of dietary intake are rare.

Although the data are fragmented, nutritional guidance and designed nutritional solutions are a promising means to positively modulate the gut microbiome maturation trajectory of infants and children.

The importance of an age-appropriate gut microbiome development and maturation is generally acknowledged. The extent to which an accelerated or delayed microbiome maturation profile affects the health of a child starts to be understood and individual microbial taxa and their metabolites emerge as causal agents. Despite the great progress in describing and understanding the early life gut microbiome, several key questions warrant to be understood. To this end, simultaneous investigation of the microbiome maturation trajectory in conjunction with immune and host–microbiota co-metabolites during early life may help to better define the neonatal windows of opportunity in humans.

The extent to which the identified microbes and metabolic pathways are indicators of suboptimal host gut–microbiome mutualism and are causally linked to health conditions remains to be more generally established. It bears the obvious question to what extent corrective actions will work. Culture and tradition are key drivers in food choices influencing the maturing microbiome [102]. Importantly, which nutrients and food groups favor an appropriate gut microbiome maturation and eventually enable the development of appropriate immune competence are of broad research and public health interest.
