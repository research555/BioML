High‐throughput sequencing reveals the core gut microbiome of Bar‐headed goose (Anser indicus) in different wintering areas in Tibet

Elucidating the spatial dynamic and core gut microbiome related to wild bar‐headed goose is of crucial importance for probiotics development that may meet the demands of bar‐headed goose artificial breeding industries and accelerate the domestication of this species. However, the core microbial communities in the wild bar‐headed geese remain totally unknown. Here, for the first time, we present a comprehensive survey of bar‐headed geese gut microbial communities by Illumina high‐throughput sequencing technology using nine individuals from three distinct wintering locations in Tibet. A total of 236,676 sequences were analyzed, and 607 OTUs were identified. We show that the gut microbial communities of bar‐headed geese have representatives of 14 phyla and are dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. The additive abundance of these four most dominant phyla was above 96% across all the samples. At the genus level, the sequences represented 150 genera. A set of 19 genera were present in all samples and considered as core gut microbiome. The top seven most abundant core genera were distributed in that four dominant phyla. Among them, four genera (Lactococcus, Bacillus, Solibacillus, and Streptococcus) belonged to Firmicutes, while for other three phyla, each containing one genus, such as Proteobacteria (genus Pseudomonas), Actinobacteria (genus Arthrobacter), and Bacteroidetes (genus Bacteroides). This broad survey represents the most in‐depth assessment, to date, of the gut microbes that associated with bar‐headed geese. These data create a baseline for future bar‐headed goose microbiology research, and make an original contribution to probiotics development for bar‐headed goose artificial breeding industries.

The bar‐headed goose (Anser indicus) is endemic to Asia, breeding in selected wetlands on the high plateaus of central Asia (a discontinuous range from Kyrgyzstan in the west to central China, and as far as Mongolia in the north) (Takekawa et al. 2009), wintering in the south‐central Tibet (more than 25% of the world populations) (Bishop et al. 1997) and India (about 50% of the world populations) (Javed et al. 2000). This goose species, with a total worldwide populations of 60,000, currently does not approach the thresholds for vulnerable and is evaluated as Least Concern under the new IUCN Red List criteria (version 3.1) (IUCN 2012). Bar‐headed geese migrate along the central Asian flyway, and up to half of the world's populations fly over the Himalayan Mountains on their biannual migration between central Asia and India (Hawkes et al. 2011). Therefore, bar‐headed geese provide an exceptional opportunity to understand the molecular and physiological bases of high‐altitude adaptation.

Among avians, gut microbiome research mainly focused on commercially farmed species such as chicken (Sergeant et al. 2014), turkey (Lu and Domingo 2008) and ostrich (Matsui et al. 2010). Only limited data are available about the gut microbiome of the wild birds such as parrots (Waite et al. 2012), South American folivorous hoatzins (Godoy‐Vitorino et al. 2012), penguins (Dewar et al. 2013), and New World vultures (Roggenbuck et al. 2014). Prior to this study, virtually nothing was known about the composition and structure of the gut microbiota related to the wild bar‐headed goose. In this article, 16S rRNA gene analysis was used to identify gut microbial community composition, and the fecal samples derived from different wintering flocks of bar‐headed geese in Tibet were compared to characterize the core gut microbes. This study represents the first census of gut microbes identified in various flocks of bar‐headed geese, with the ultimate goal to develop probiotics and enhance reproductive rate of this domesticated bird.

The experiment complied with the Animal Management Rule of the National Health and Family Planning Commission, People's Republic of China (documentation 55, 2001), and fecal samples collection were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

All the field works were permitted by the Administration for Wild animal and plant protection and Nature Reserve, Tibet Provincial Department of Forestry. A total of nine fresh bar‐headed geese fecal samples were collected from individuals in three wintering flocks inhabiting different areas (separated by 50 km) in Tibet on 10–11 February 2015. Three fecal samples were collected from overwintering flock 1 (F1) in Chexiu country (29°10′31.8″N, 88°28′03.1″E), Sajia county, Xigaze city, Tibet. Three fecal samples were collected from overwintering flock 2 (F2) in Nierixiong country (29°19′24.6″N, 88°50′28.2″E), Xigaze city, Tibet. Three fecal samples were collected from overwintering flock 3 (F3) in Chabalang country (29°22′18.0″N, 90°47′31.1″E), Qushui county, Lhasa city, Tibet. All three locations are the typical wintering habitats for bar‐headed geese. Approximately 1 g of feces were collected from the inner part of fecal balls, avoiding collection of fecal materials that were touching the ground. All samples were placed in sterile containers and transported to the laboratory in a car‐carried refrigerator. In laboratory, fecal samples were kept frozen at −80°C until processing.

Microbial DNA was extracted from fecal samples using the E.Z.N.A.® stool DNA Kit (Omega Bio‐tek, Norcross, GA) according to manufacturer's protocol. The V4–V5 region of the bacteria 16S rRNA gene were amplified by PCR (95°C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 30 sec and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min) using primers 515F 5′ ‐ barcode ‐ (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGG)‐3′ and 907R 5′ ‐ (CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGTTT)‐3′, where barcode is an eight‐base sequence unique to each sample. PCR reactions were performed in triplicate, 20 μL mixture containing 4 μL of 5× FastPfu Buffer, 2 μL of 2.5 mmol/L dNTPs, 0.8 μL of each primer (5 μmol/L), 0.4 μL of FastPfu Polymerase, and 10 ng of template DNA. Amplicons were extracted from 2% agarose gels and purified using the AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and quantified using QuantiFluor™ ‐ ST (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar and paired‐end sequenced (2 × 300) on an Illumina MiSeq platform according to the standard protocol. The raw reads were deposited into the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (Accession Number: SRP057952).

The raw fastq files were demultiplexed based on the barcode and primer sequence with the following criteria: (1) exact barcode matching, (2) two nucleotide mismatch in primer matching, (3) reads containing ambiguous characters were removed. Then, PE reads for nine fecal samples were run through Trimmomatic (version 0.33) (Bolger et al. 2014) to remove low‐quality base pairs using these parameters [SLIDINGWINDOW: 50: 20 MINLEN: 50]. Trimmed reads were then further merged using FLASH program (version 1.2.8) (Magocˇ and Salzberg 2011) with the parameters [‐m 10 ‐x 0.2 ‐p 33 ‐r 300 ‐f 450 ‐s 150].

The 16S sequences were analyzed using a combination of software UPARSE (usearch version v8.0.1517, http://drive5.com/uparse/) (Edgar 2013), QIIME (version 1.8) (Kuczynski et al. 2012), and R (version 3.1.2). The demultiplexed reads were clustered at 97% sequence identity into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using the UPARSE pipeline (http://drive5.com/usearch/manual/uparse_cmds.html). The OTU representative sequences were aligned against to the greengenes reference template set (http://greengenes.lbl.gov/Download/Sequence_Data/Fasta_data_files/core_set_aligned.fasta.imputed) based on PyNAST (version 1.2.1) (Caporaso et al. 2010). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using FastTree (version 2.1.3) (Price et al. 2010) with the filtered alignment. The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier (version 2.2) (Wang et al. 2007) was employed for taxonomy assignment against Greengenes (version gg_13_8) (DeSantis et al. 2006) with confidence score ≥0.8. For the alpha‐diversity metrics, richness estimators (ACE and Chao1), diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson) were calculated by mothur (version 1.32.1) (Schloss et al. 2009) and Rarefaction plots were generated with iterations of 10 at each sampling depth 100 and increments of 100. For the beta‐diversity metrics, the weighted UniFrac distance matrix (Lozupone and Knight 2005) were calculated and visualized with Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) analyses in QIIME. Biomarker discovery analysis of each taxonomic unit was performed using LeFse (version 1.0.7) (Segata et al. 2011). All figures were generated with customized R scripts.

After filtering the low‐quality reads, trimming the longer homopolymer runs, adapters, barcodes and primers, and rarefying the datasets, 21,167 to 34,340 effective sequences were collected from each fecal sample, resulting in a total of 236,676 sequences from the nine samples. The total number of reads, number of base pairs, and the mean length of the reads obtained from the original fastq file of each fecal sample before and after quality control filters are presented in Table S1.

The observed species rarefaction curves were calculated for each sample to assess whether the depth of sequencing were large enough to yield a stable estimate of the species richness at the 97% similarity threshold. We found that the rarefaction curves reached the saturation plateau (Fig. S2A), indicating that sequencing depth was large enough to yield stable and unbiased estimates of species richness. We also used a species accumulation curve to determine if the bacterial diversity observed in our nine fecal samples represented the overall bacterial diversity present in bar‐headed geese gastrointestinal tract. This approach measures how many new OTUs are identified as additional samples are cumulatively added to the analysis. As shown in Figure S2B, the number of OTUs increased quickly at the range of 1 to 6 samples, and began to plateau by the end of our sampling, which indicated that we have largely saturated the bacterial diversity found in this situation.

Several different patterns of gut microbial compositions were distinguished in the comparison at each taxonomic level. Table S2 showed the number of taxonomic units detected in each samples. The compositions of microbial community at the levels of Class, Order, and Family were shown in Figure S3–S5.

At the genus level, the sequences from the samples represented 150 genera (all genera named in Table S4). The top 20 genera were listed in Figure 1B. The sequences that could not be classified into any known genus were assigned as “unclassified”. The proportions of these unclassified genera varied between 1.70 and 49.91% among the different samples. These sequences represented 16.55% of the full dataset. Lactococcus was the most predominant genus, with relative abundance ranging from 4.27 to 56.67%. Other dominant genera in each samples were listed in Table S5. For each dominant genus, its distribution among the nine samples was either varied or consistent. For each sample, percentages of these genera were highly diversified.

To survey the relationships of the gut microbial communities among nine samples, the weighted UniFrac PCoA and hierarchical dendrogram were analyzed (Fig. 2). There were obvious separated and overlapped samples for each of the wintering flocks. The fecal samples derived from F3 grouped closer than other two flocks. Samples F2_1, F2_3, and F1_3 exhibited higher changes in community compositions. These results confirmed that gut microbial communities of the majority of bar‐headed geese (6 of 9 samples) were significantly more similar.

A major research interest of this study was to determine whether a core gut microbiota is shared among all or the vast majority of the samples. To identify the core genera, we selected three core thresholds (as described by (Otani et al. 2014)): (1) genera present in all nine samples (100% core), (2) genera present in at least eight of nine samples (88.9% core), and (3) genera present in at least seven of nine samples (77.9% core).

Using a slightly less strict core criterion (present in at least eight samples, 88.9% core threshold), another 14 genera were identified (Table S6). Using the even less strict criterion (present in at least seven samples, 77.9% core threshold), extra 18 genera were identified (Table S6).

Bar‐headed geese are currently one of the most popular species for the rare birds breeding industries in China. Recent studies have revealed important contributions of gut microbiome to health and disease in animals (Lee and Hase 2014). Thus far, studies regarding the microbial community of bar‐headed geese have been relatively limited. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first one that characterized the core gut microbiome of bar‐headed goose with deep sequencing methodology.

Bacteroides species have extensive machinery to utilize the complex polysaccharides present in the colon as a source of carbon and energy. In doing so, the fermentative end products released by Bacteroides also provide nutrition and other beneficial properties to the host (Comstock 2009). There are many open questions regarding the bar‐headed goose‐Bacteroides mutualism. And it will be interesting to determine which dietary fiber is utilized by various Bacteroides species.

Our knowledge of the role of gut microbiome in avian hosts lags far behind our understanding of mammalian systems. For the first time, we defined the core gut microbiome of bar‐headed goose in different wintering areas in Tibet. Our study creates a baseline for future bar‐headed goose microbiology research, and make an original contribution to probiotics development for bar‐headed goose artificial breeding industries. A total of 236,676 sequences from the nine samples were analyzed, and 607 OTUs were identified. Several different patterns of gut microbial community composition were compared at each taxonomic level. The gut microbial communities of bar‐headed geese had representatives of 14 phyla and were dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. At the genus level, the sequences represented 150 genera. A set of 19 genera were present in all samples and considered as core gut microbiome. The core gut microbes shared by all the samples might be associated with key physiological characteristics of bar‐headed geese and should be candidates for future probiotics development. These described data, in combination with ongoing metagenomics studies, should contribute to the domestication of bar‐headed goose.
