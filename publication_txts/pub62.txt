Mapping the colorectal tumor microbiota

The gut microbiome in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) is different than that of healthy controls. Previous studies have profiled the CRC tumor microbiome using a single biopsy. However, since the morphology and cellular subtype vary significantly within an individual tumor, the possibility of sampling error arises for the microbiome within an individual tumor. To test this hypothesis, seven biopsies were taken from representative areas on and off the tumor in five patients with CRC. The microbiome composition was strikingly similar across all samples from an individual. The variation in microbiome alpha-diversity was significantly greater between individuals’ samples then within individuals. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that shows that the microbiome of an individual tumor is spatially homogeneous. Our finding strengthens the assumption that a single biopsy is representative of the entire tumor, and that microbiota changes are not limited to a specific area of the neoplasm.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second largest cause of cancer death in the United States1. Sporadic CRC arises after a series of cumulative genetic mutations,2 with a 10-year progression from adenoma to CRC.3 The microbiome is distinctly different in biopsies of CRC and adenomatous polyps,4,5 leading to an updated hypothesis that microbial changes6 and secondary consequences for immunological cell signaling7 may play a role in tumor progression. Bacteria are an established risk factor for cancer, such as H. pylori-related MALT lymphoma and gastric carcinoma.8,9 In particular, several individual microbes such as Fusobacterium nucleatum10 and Escherichia coli11 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, but a cause–effect relationship has not been established; rather, microbes and their metabolomes represent complex collections of gene networks that interact bidirectionally with cancer cells.12

Untargeted colonoscopy biopsies or untargeted segments of resected tumors have been used in most studies of CRC microbiota.4,14,30,31 Given the histologic and genetic intratumoral heterogeneity32 of CRC, topographic variance in the microbiota of a single tumor may be a confounding factor. Therefore, we undertook the first study that aims to investigate the intratumoral microbial heterogeneity and its comparison with adjacent proximal and distal non-cancerous tissue.

Five patients were recruited to the study, four males and one female, with a mean age of 72 ± 6.7 years with demographics shown in Table 1. All patients had a diagnosis of colonic adenocarcinoma within the previous 1–2 months. Seven samples were obtained from each individual comprising normal tissue proximal to the tumor (biopsy 6), normal tissue distal to the tumor (biopsy 5), a central tumoral biopsy (biopsy 5) and four peripheral tumor biopsies (biopsies 1–4). The tissue microbiome was profiled by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.

The sequencing depth of the samples allowed for a thorough investigation of alpha diversity, that is microbial richness and evenness (Supplementary table 6, Supplementary Figure 3S). Considering all biopsies from each sample sites examined, the difference in alpha diversity of the biopsy microbiota datasets as measured by five different indices was significantly greater between any two individuals than it was within individuals (Figure 3c, Supplementary figure 4S).

Many studies have profiled the microbiome in CRC using cancer tissue4,14,30,31 from a single biopsy assuming that the microbiome profiled in this single specimen was representative of the tumor as a whole. This study confirms that this is a valid assumption.

The global burden of CRC is increasing and this disease is a significant contributor to cancer deaths1. Prospective trials are ongoing that incorporate microbiota analysis with other factors as part of the investigative assessment and staging of cancer44 and to predict CRC outcomes.45 Through demonstration of microbial homogeneity within an individual tumor and in the adjacent normal tissue, this study helps validate the methodology of sampling tissue going forward for these and other indications.

A total of five patients who were scheduled for colonic resection for colorectal cancer as part of their standard of care at Cork University Hospital and Mercy University Hospital, Cork were recruited for the study. Patients were labeled as GT (Geography of Tumor) 001,007,009,010 and 011. Recruitment to the study took place from February 2019 to June 2019. Ethical approval was granted by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals (Cork, Ireland). The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles set forth in the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization E6 Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP). Exclusion criteria included a history of inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome, a significant acute or chronic coexisting illness and neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. All patients received a macrogol preparation preoperatively. A single dose of oral metronidazole and neomycin were administered to two patients preoperatively and two other patients received intraoperative intravenous co-amoxiclav and metronidazole as per hospital protocol. The fifth patient took no antibiotics. None of the patients had probiotic exposure preoperatively.

A mouth swab was taken from patients in the preoperative room prior to anesthesia and snap frozen. Immediately after removal from the patient, the ex-vivo specimen was anatomically orientated, was dissected and the tumor was exposed. A representative tissue biopsy from each of the four quadrants of the tumor was taken in a clockwise manner starting at 12 o’clock. Tissues from the central area of the tumor plus two biopsies of adjacent macroscopically normal tissue 10 cm proximal and distal to the tumor were taken. A different set of sterile instruments was used for every biopsy taken and for each individual. This ensured there was no transfer of bacterial material from sample to sample within or between individuals. Samples were snap frozen in cryotubes and transferred immediately for storage at −80 °C.

Genomic DNA from biopsies was extracted using the AllPrep DNA kit from Qiagen. When preparing each sample, approximately 20 mg in total of tissue was dissected in small fragments from around the biopsy and pooled. These pooled fragments were then added to a bead beating tube containing sterile beads and 600 µl of buffer RLT plus was added. Samples were then homogenized for two 15 sec at full speed pulses in a MagnaLyzer (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) with rests on ice between pulses. The rest of the DNA extraction was carried out according to the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA extraction kit. Oral genomic DNA was extracted using Qiagen DNeasy PowerSoil Kit following the manufacturer’s instruction.

The 16S rRNA gene was amplified using primers for the V3-V4 region; forward, TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3ʹ. DNA was normalized to a concentration of 10 ng/µl and 10 µl DNA was added per 30 µl PCR reaction. The PCR thermocycler protocol was as follows: Initiation step of 98°C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 98°C for 30 s, 55°C for 60 s, and 72°C for 20 s, and a final extension step of 72°C for 5 min. Indexes were subsequently added to the purified amplicons according to Illumina 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Protocol (Illumina, CA, USA). Libraries DNA concentration was quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen) using the ‘High Sensitivity’ assay and samples were pooled at a standardized concentration (80 ng of each sample). The pooled library was sequenced at Eurofins Genomics/GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany) on the Illumina MiSeq platform using 2 × 300 bp chemistry. All the samples in this study were prepared in the same library and sequenced together.

Raw data was imported into R v3.5.3 for processing and analysis. Paired reads were quality filtered, trimmed, merged and Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV) inferred using the R package dada2 v1.12.1. The following parameters were used for the filterAndTrim function; filtRs,trimLeft = c(19,21),maxEE = c(2,2), truncLen = c(260,230). Taxonomic classification was performed using the RDP naive Bayesian Classifier within the dada2 against the Silva v132 database. Alpha diversity was calculated from the ASV table using QIIME v1.9.1 as previously described in Kuczynski et al.46 Samples were rarefied to 7000 reads in order to calculate alpha-diversity. QIIME v1.9.1 and the R package vegan v2.5.6 were used to infer β-diversity metrics.47 β-diversity was visualized via principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots whose coordinates were identified using the Ape package v5.1. The adonis() function within the R package vegan (v2.4–2) was used to perform permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) difference in paired biopsy-buccal distance was assessed using paired Wilcoxon test. DESeq2 (v1.28.1) was used to identify differentially abundant taxa from the microbiota dataset.33 Differences between inter- and intra-alpha diversity were tested using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

We first carried out mock extractions to detect reagent-associated contamination from the two kits used in this study (Supplementary figure 5S). Further, we also carried out PCR controls, i.e., water, to detect contamination specific to the polymerase (Supplementary figure 5S). These negative controls underwent 5–10 additional PCR cycles relative to biological specimens to capture low levels of bacterial template. We utilized both the frequency and prevalence method within the R package decontam (v1.8.0) to identify contaminating ASVs.48 Using the “frequency” method, isContaminant(phyloseq_object, method = “frequency”, conc = “qubit”,threshold = 0.05), two ASVs were identified (Supplementary figure 6S). However, these ASVs were present at a very low abundance and only present in two samples. Furthermore, these ASVs were assigned to Clostridiales and Burkholderiales which are known gut taxa and not indicative of contamination (Supplementary table 7). Using the “prevalence” method, isContaminant(phyloseq_object, method = “prevalence”, neg = “is.neg”,threshold = 0.05), we identified seven contaminating ASVs (Supplementary table 8). However, these ASVs were only identified in three of our samples and only contributed between 2–6 reads to the samples. Thus, we treated them negligibly.
