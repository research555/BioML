Microbiomes of Hadal Fishes across Trench Habitats Contain Similar Taxa and Known Piezophiles



Hadal snailfishes are the deepest-living fishes in the ocean, inhabiting trenches from depths of ∼6,000 to 8,000 m. While the microbial communities in trench environments have begun to be characterized, the microbes associated with hadal megafauna remain relatively unknown. Here, we describe the gut microbiomes of two hadal snailfishes, Pseudoliparis swirei (Mariana Trench) and Notoliparis kermadecensis (Kermadec Trench), using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We contextualize these microbiomes with comparisons to the abyssal macrourid Coryphaenoides yaquinae and the continental shelf-dwelling snailfish Careproctus melanurus. The microbial communities of the hadal snailfishes were distinct from their shallower counterparts and were dominated by the same sequences related to the Mycoplasmataceae and Desulfovibrionaceae. These shared taxa indicate that symbiont lineages have remained similar to the ancestral symbiont since their geographic separation or that they are dispersed between geographically distant trenches and subsequently colonize specific hosts. The abyssal and hadal fishes contained sequences related to known, cultured piezophiles, microbes that grow optimally under high hydrostatic pressure, including Psychromonas, Moritella, and Shewanella. These taxa are adept at colonizing nutrient-rich environments present in the deep ocean, such as on particles and in the guts of hosts, and we hypothesize they could make a dietary contribution to deep-sea fishes by degrading chitin and producing fatty acids. We characterize the gut microbiota within some of the deepest fishes to provide new insight into the diversity and distribution of host-associated microbial taxa and the potential of these animals, and the microbes they harbor, for understanding adaptation to deep-sea habitats.

IMPORTANCE Hadal trenches, characterized by high hydrostatic pressures and low temperatures, are one of the most extreme environments on our planet. By examining the microbiome of abyssal and hadal fishes, we provide insight into the diversity and distribution of host-associated life at great depth. Our findings show that there are similar microbial populations in fishes geographically separated by thousands of miles, reflecting strong selection for specific microbial lineages. Only a few psychropiezophilic taxa, which do not reflect the diversity of microbial life at great depth, have been successfully isolated in the laboratory. Our examination of deep-sea fish microbiomes shows that typical high-pressure culturing methodologies, which have largely remained unchanged since the pioneering work of Claude ZoBell in the 1950s, may simulate the chemical environment found in animal guts and helps explain why the same deep-sea genera are consistently isolated.

The gut microbiome plays an essential role in the physiology of fishes. Microbiota within fishes can help digest food by producing degradative enzymes, provide the host with vitamins and fatty acids, and competitively exclude pathogens (1,–4). While the importance of gut microbiomes is recognized, few studies have explored the structure and function of microbiomes in deep-sea fishes. Cultivation of microorganisms from deep-sea animals has revealed the presence of piezophiles (5,–8), microbes capable of optimal growth under in situ, deep-sea high hydrostatic pressure conditions. This includes members of the genera Colwellia, Psychromonas, Shewanella, Moritella, and Photobacterium, some of the only lineages which have been experimentally demonstrated in the laboratory to be piezophilic (9, 10). These microbes represent a small fraction of the broader water and sediment communities in the deep ocean, which are instead composed primarily of members of the Thaumarchaeota, Marinimicrobia (SAR406), and other members of the Proteobacteria (11,–14). However, a description of the complete breadth of microbial diversity within the guts of deep-sea fishes is lacking.

Here, we describe the gut microbiota of four representative, ecologically important deep-sea fishes using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. This includes two of the deepest-living hadal snailfishes, Pseudoliparis swirei from the Mariana Trench and Notoliparis kermadecensis from the Kermadec Trench. These fishes and the trenches they inhabit are geographically separated, residing approximately 6,000 km apart within the Pacific Ocean. The Mariana Trench is located in the Northern Hemisphere and extends to a depth in excess of 10,900 m (35). The Kermadec Trench is in the Southern Hemisphere off the coast of New Zealand and reaches a depth exceeding 10,000 m (36). We compared the microbiota of the snailfishes with two shallower-dwelling fishes, the abyssal macrourid Coryphaenoides yaquinae, which inhabits depths of ∼3,000 to 7,000 m (26), and Careproctus melanurus Gilbert 1892 (37), a demersal snailfish typically found at depths of 200 to 1,600 m (38). Our findings inform new understanding of host-symbiont interactions in the abyssal and hadal ocean, the ecology of piezophilic microbes, and the biology of the planet’s deepest-living vertebrates.

The gut microbial communities within snailfish from the Mariana Trench (Pseudoliparis swirei; n = 18, collection depths of 6,898 to 7,966 m) and Kermadec Trench (Notoliparis kermadecensis; n = 7, collection depths of 6,456 to 7,515 m) were compared against those in a continental shelf-dwelling snailfish (Careproctus melanurus; n = 11, collection depths of 381 to 834 m) and an abyssal rattail (Coryphaenoides yaquinae; n = 4, collection depths of 4,441 to 6,081 m) (Fig. 1; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material). We identified a total of 2,034 amplified sequence variants (ASVs) across these four species with final amplicon libraries ranging from 2,545 to 106,059 reads per sample (average of ∼46,500 reads per sample).

Gut microbial communities were distinct between the hadal snailfishes, the rattail C. yaquinae, and the slope-dwelling C. melanurus. The hadal fishes had lower alpha diversity than the shallower fishes, with the gut microbiome of C. yaquinae appearing more even (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination analysis of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity demonstrated that microbial gut communities of each fish species were distinct from one another, where species type accounted for 37% of the variability (Fig. 2C; permutational analysis of variance [PERMANOVA], R2 = 0.37, F = 7.22, df = 3, P < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons showed that while the microbiome of Pseudoliparis swirei differed from that in Notoliparis kermadecensis (R2 = 0.09, P < 0.013, F = 2.52), these differences were small compared to those in the other fishes. For further context, the gut microbiomes of the four species of interest were compared to those from a diverse collection of fishes. This data set included 16 marine fish hosts (Iacuaniello CM, Blanton JM, Allen EE, unpublished data) spanning a range of depths (all shallower than 1,000 m) and feeding strategies (15, 39). The abyssal and hadal microbial communities were also distinct from those within the broader fish gut data set, while bathydemersal Careproctus melanurus gut communities were interspersed with samples from other shallower fishes (Fig. S2; species type, R2 = 0.46, F = 4.25, df = 16, P < 0.001).

The microbiome of Notoliparis kermadecensis was dominated by only a few ASVs such that the top 10 most abundant sequences made up more than 75% of the communities of each fish (Fig. 3). Two of the most abundant ASVs were related to the Mycoplasmataceae and composed ∼60% (range, ∼5 to 99%) of the gut community. One of these Mycoplasmataceae ASVs was identical to the 16S rRNA gene reported from a hadal fish from the Mariana Trench (34) and was distantly related (<95% similar) to sequences found within other fishes (40, 41, 42) (Fig. S3). The second ASV was also similar to those found in other cold-water fish, including notothenioids from Antarctica (43) and grayling from Siberia (44). Two sequences related to Moritella together made up ∼19% of each community (range, ∼0 to 60%) and were more than 97% similar to 16S rRNA genes from both piezophilic (45) and nonpiezophilic taxa. An ASV related to the Desulfovibrionaceae was present in all seven N. kermadecensis specimens (mean, ∼3%; range, ∼0.005 to 14%). This ASV was more than 97% similar to sequences from notothenioid fish from Antarctic waters (43) and freshwater grayling from Lake Baikal but less than 95% similar to other sequences (Fig. S4). We also identified an ASV related to the Rhodobacteraceae (range, ∼0 to 43%) that was present in one sample in high abundance and was identical to sequences from the deep ocean, including the Japan Trench at 7,000 m (46). Other abundant ASVs included those classified as members of the Pseudarthrobacter (Micrococcaceae; mean, ∼5%; range, ∼0 to 17%; identified in every specimen), Corynebacteriaceae (mean, ∼0.5%; range, ∼0 to 3%), and Photobacterium (average, ∼0.5%; range, ∼0 to 1.5%).

We compared the microbial communities in the two hadal fishes against one another. Psychromonas was more abundant in the Mariana snailfish, while Moritella, Pseudarthrobacter, and Photobacterium were enriched in the Kermadec snailfish (Fig. 4C). Sequences related to the Mycoplasmataceae and Desulfovibrionaceae were not differentially enriched within either fish.

We also analyzed the microbiota of the shallower-living snailfish Careproctus melanurus collected from ∼300- to 800-m depth. Although this fish had higher alpha diversity than the hadal snailfishes (Fig. 2), the gut-associated microbial community was still dominated by only a few sequences (Fig. 3). The most abundant ASV was related to the Holosporaceae (mean, ∼50%; range, ∼0 to 92%) and showed >97% sequence similarity to taxa identified within other host-associated systems, including marine shrimp (49). Other ASVs included three relatives of the genus Brevinema (combined mean abundance, ∼20%; range, ∼0 to 100%), which were similar to those found in graylings from Lake Baikal, mudsuckers, and unicornfish. We note the presence of two ASVs related to the genera Moritella (combined mean, ∼1%; range, 0 to 11%) and Photobacterium (combined mean, ∼7%; range, ∼0 to 33%). These ASVs were similar (>99%) to both known piezophilic and piezosensitive species. Other abundant ASVs included taxa in the Vibrionaceae (mean, ∼3%; range, ∼0 to 13%), Clostridiaceae (mean, ∼2%; range, ∼0 to 17%), and Synechococcus (mean, ∼1%; range, ∼0.005 to 4%). The Clostridiaceae ASV was present in both N. kermadecensis and P. swirei at low abundances.

Finally, we leveraged a broader data set of fishes and environmental samples to investigate microbial lineages specific to the hadal fishes. We first screened these samples for specific ASVs that were abundant in the hadal fishes, including those related to the Mycoplasmataceae, Desulfovibrionaceae, Psychromonas, Moritella, and Shewanella. While these lineages dominated the hadal samples, they were not found at high abundances in any other fish (Fig. S7). These ASVs represented a miniscule fraction of Mariana Trench sediment and water samples, reflecting on average only 0.007% of the community (identified in 4 of 16 samples; maximum abundance, 0.036%). We broadened our search to include any ASV related to the Mycoplasmataceae and found that many of the shallower fish gut microbiomes contained this family (Fig. S8). While we did not find high abundances of sequences related to known piezophilic lineages in the comparison fishes, we found that almost all of the shallower-living fish gut communities included Photobacterium and Vibrio (Fig. 5).

We describe the gut-associated microbial communities within the hadal snailfishes Pseudoliparis swirei and Notoliparis kermadecensis, the abyssal rattail Coryphaenoides yaquinae, and the continental slope-dwelling snailfish Careproctus melanurus. These fishes include some of the dominant vertebrates at abyssal and hadal depths. The microbial communities within these four species were distinct from one another. Our findings show that while the shallow and deep-water snailfishes belong to the same family, they have large differences in their gut microbiota. The communities were also different between the abyssal and hadal teleosts, indicating fishes that experience similar environmental conditions at great depth do not necessarily have similar microbial gut flora. In contrast, many of the most abundant lineages were shared between both hadal snailfishes. It has been proposed that Pseudoliparis and Notoliparis should be synonymized as one genus (24, 57), suggesting these fish have similar host physicochemical variables that could influence their microbiome (e.g., pH and O2) (58, 59, 60). One explanation for the observed differences in the fish gut microbiomes could be diet. Host trophic strategy influences the diversity of microbial communities within the gut (59 to ,62) and may be one reason for the shift in fishes at the abyssal-hadal boundary (63). Hadal snailfishes primarily eat amphipods and occasionally polychaetes and decapod shrimp, reflecting a restrictive diet. The diet of Careproctus melanurus also consists of crustaceans, including amphipods, shrimp, mysids, and tanaids, but can also include bivalves, polychaetes, and fish (64, 65). In contrast, the diet of C. yaquinae is composed primarily of carrion, along with squid, crustaceans, and other fish (18, 33). The relatively narrow dietary choices of hadal fishes may shape their gut microbiomes in relation to shallower fishes. Future work should investigate how host physiology, diet, and environmental factors, such as differences in water mass or organic matter input (32, 66, 67), impact deep-sea fish gut microbiota.

In addition to clarifying the role of recognized, lab-characterized piezophilic lineages, the examination of microbial diversity associated with extreme deep-sea animals reveals new taxa that likely possess pressure-adapted lifestyles. These taxa represent broad phylogenetic groups that significantly extend the hyperpiezophile ranks beyond the Gammaproteobacteria, including Mycoplasmataceae, Desulfobacterota, and Actinobacteria (Pseudarthrobacter). For example, the presence of Desulfovibrionaceae ASVs within both abyssal and hadal fishes indicates the presence of sulfate reduction occurring within the guts of deep-ocean fishes at high hydrostatic pressure. Future studies that integrate metagenomic profiling combined with novel cultivation approaches that mimic the in vivo fish gut microbial ecosystem will be required to more fully define the breadth of metabolic activities that support the success of the microbes and the fish they inhabit within the deep sea.

Abyssal and hadal fishes were collected from the Kermadec and Mariana trenches aboard the R/V Thomas G. Thompson and R/V Falkor during April to May 2014 and November to December 2014, respectively. Fishes were caught using free-vehicle lander systems equipped with acoustic releases (26). The traps were baited with mackerel and squid wrapped in nylon mesh to limit bait ingestion by sampled taxa. Once fish specimens were on board they were immediately placed on ice and processed. Gut material was carefully extracted from the hindgut, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen either dry or in RNA Later, and stored at −80°C. One Notoliparis specimen was reported as belonging to a different species, Notoliparis stewarti, based on morphological characteristics (NK100329) (110). Because of the similarity of these two potentially different species, their presentation as the same species in previous publications, and the apparent similarity of their microbiomes, we report this one specimen as N. kermadecensis throughout the manuscript but acknowledge future work is needed to fully characterize the taxonomy of hadal fishes. Specimens of Careproctus melanurus were collected by trawl aboard the F/V Noah’s Ark and F/V Last Straw during the summer 2014 NOAA NWFSC Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey. One specimen was also collected from a 2015 UC Ship Funds-supported student cruise aboard the R/V Sproul. Following the storage of whole fishes at −20°C, specimens were defrosted and the hindgut dissected. Gut contents from C. melanurus were submerged in Chaos lysis buffer (5 M guanidine thiocyanate, 2% sarkosyl, 50 mM EDTA, 40 μg/mL proteinase K, and 15% beta-mercaptoethanol) and stored at −80°C prior to analysis. We acknowledge that these slightly different methods of sample processing and preservation, given the constraints of shipboard sample collection, may influence microbial community composition downstream.

DNA was extracted from gut samples using an organic extraction method. Intestinal contents were defrosted and resuspended in Chaos buffer. After a 30-min incubation at 55°C, samples were homogenized by bead-beating with silica beads. Lysate was then treated with one volume of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). DNA in the resulting aqueous layer was cleaned with the Zymo Research Quick-gDNA MiniPrep kit (Irvine, CA). Negative-control extractions were performed with each set of fish samples.

After extraction, the V4 region (∼290 bp) of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using a two-step PCR protocol to create dual-barcoded amplicons. The first reaction used primers 515F-Y and 806rb with overhangs for attachment of Illumina-compatible indexes in the second reaction (111). The initial reaction was performed in triplicate using Q5 polymerase (NEB, Ipswitch, MA) with the following steps: initial denaturation of 30 s at 98°C; 25 cycles of 10 s at 98°C, 20 s at 50°C, 30 s at 72°C; final extension of 2 min at 72°C. Triplicate reaction mixtures were combined, and 5 μL of each sample pool was used as the template in a second reaction to attach unique indexing primer pairs. The second reaction was performed as described above except using only 8 cycles and an annealing temperature of 56°C. Barcoded amplicons were cleaned using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA), pooled at equimolar concentrations, and sequenced on Illumina's MiSeq platform (2 × 300 bp) at the UC San Diego Institute for Genomic Medicine and the UC Davis Genome Center.

Paired raw reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic v0.35 (112) and filtered to sequences of ≥100 bp. Trimmed reads were imported into the QIIME 2 platform v2018.6 (113), where the Dada2 workflow plugin v2018.6 (114) was used to trim primer regions, denoise, and merge sequences to generate ASVs. Chimeras were removed using the consensus method. Nonribosomal sequences were excluded and taxonomy was assigned to ASVs using the scikit-learn naive Bayes machine-learning classifier (115) in QIIME 2 trained on the SILVA v128 small subunit database (116). Further filtering and all downstream analyses were performed in R (117). Singletons, sequences classified as eukaryotic, or those unassigned at the domain level were removed. To ensure a conservative analysis, potential contaminants were identified by cooccurrence network of all ASVs using the R package ccrepe v1.24.0 (118). Twelve ASVs that belonged to the genera Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas and the families Comamonadaceae, Caulobacteraceae, and Methylophilaceae were identified as both cooccurring and representative of common contaminants (119). These ASVs were filtered from all samples (see Fig. S9 in the supplemental material). Alpha and beta diversity of communities were estimated using the R package phyloseq v1.32.0 (120). Differentially abundant taxa between the different fishes were identified using DESeq2 v1.28.1 (121) with ASVs of less than 10 reads excluded. We statistically tested the importance of host species on structuring Bray-Curtis dissimilarity by permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using the adonis and pairwiseAdonis functions (122, 123). For phylogenetic analyses, representative 16S rRNA gene sequences were aligned using SINA Aligner (124) and trees built using FastTree using default settings (125). Trees were visualized using the Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) (126).

For further context, the gut microbiomes of the four fish of interest were compared to microbial data sets from a diverse collection of fishes from depths shallower than 1,000 m and water and sediments from the Mariana Trench. The comparative fish data set included catshark (Apristurus brunneus), hatchetfish (Argyropelecus affinis and other Sternoptichydae), smelt (Atherinopsis californiensis), hagfish (Eptatretus deani, Eptatretus stoutii), bristlemouths (Gonostomatidae), ridgehead (Melamphaidae), manta ray feces (Mobula birostris), lanternfish (Myctophidae), California yellowtail (Seriola lalandi), and dragonfishes (Stomiidae). These fishes were typically frozen at −20°C prior to hindgut dissection and then processed in the same manner as that described above. The complete microbial communities of these fish will be described elsewhere (Iacuniello et al., unpublished). The water (RG02, RG07, RG08, RG16, RG18; 3.0-, 0.2-, and 0.1-μm size-fractionated samples) and sediment samples (FVCR02, FVCR03, FVCR04; 0- to 1-cm depth fraction) were collected from depths exceeding 5,000 m in the Mariana Trench. A full description of their collection and extraction has been previously published (12, 13). PCR amplification and all further downstream analyses were performed as described above.
