Gut microbiome transition across a lifestyle gradient in Himalaya

The composition of the gut microbiome in industrialized populations differs from those living traditional lifestyles. However, it has been difficult to separate the contributions of human genetic and geographic factors from lifestyle. Whether shifts away from the foraging lifestyle that characterize much of humanity’s past influence the gut microbiome, and to what degree, remains unclear. Here, we characterize the stool bacterial composition of four Himalayan populations to investigate how the gut community changes in response to shifts in traditional human lifestyles. These groups led seminomadic hunting–gathering lifestyles until transitioning to varying levels of agricultural dependence upon farming. The Tharu began farming 250–300 years ago, the Raute and Raji transitioned 30–40 years ago, and the Chepang retain many aspects of a foraging lifestyle. We assess the contributions of dietary and environmental factors on their gut-associated microbes and find that differences in the lifestyles of Himalayan foragers and farmers are strongly correlated with microbial community variation. Furthermore, the gut microbiomes of all four traditional Himalayan populations are distinct from that of the Americans, indicating that industrialization may further exacerbate differences in the gut community. The Chepang foragers harbor an elevated abundance of taxa associated with foragers around the world. Conversely, the gut microbiomes of the populations that have transitioned to farming are more similar to those of Americans, with agricultural dependence and several associated lifestyle and environmental factors correlating with the extent of microbiome divergence from the foraging population. The gut microbiomes of Raute and Raji reveal an intermediate state between the Chepang and Tharu, indicating that divergence from a stereotypical foraging microbiome can occur within a single generation. Our results also show that environmental factors such as drinking water source and solid cooking fuel are significantly associated with the gut microbiome. Despite the pronounced differences in gut bacterial composition across populations, we found little differences in alpha diversity across lifestyles. These findings in genetically similar populations living in the same geographical region establish the key role of lifestyle in determining human gut microbiome composition and point to the next challenging steps of determining how large-scale gut microbiome reconfiguration impacts human biology.

Although much of humanity’s history has been spent foraging in the forests, the advent of agriculture approximately 10,000 years ago and industrialization approximately 250 years ago mark major shifts in human lifestyle. Several studies have investigated the effect of industrialization on the human gut microbiome—a collection of microbes that inhabit the human gut. However, little is known about whether the gut microbiome changed as humans shifted away from foraging. To investigate how the gut community changes in response to shifts in traditional human lifestyles, we characterized the gut microbial community from four Himalayan populations representing diverse subsistence strategies. We show that the divergence of the gut microbiome from the foraging population is strongly correlated with agricultural dependence in these populations. Many of the taxa that differ across lifestyles are known to be influenced by diet, but we also demonstrate that environmental factors, such as sources of drinking water, are strongly associated with the human gut microbiome. Our findings show that both diet and environment play key roles in shaping the human gut microbiome.

The human gut is comprised of a diverse community of bacteria, the microbiome or microbiota, that influences several aspects of human physiology, including nutrient metabolism, immune responses, and resistance to infectious pathogens [1–3]. This highly malleable microbial component of human biology exhibits rapid, and in some cases, irreversible changes in response to dietary and environmental factors [4–11]. Modern humans have experienced diverse environments since expanding out of Africa approximately 100,000 years ago. Over the past approximately 10,000 years, hunting and gathering has largely yielded to different forms of agriculturally supported lifestyles. More recently, the diet of billions of people has undergone profound changes with the advent of industrialism. Dietary changes combined with a variety of other factors associated with the industrial revolution have been credited as contributing to the alterations in the gut microbiome in industrialized populations [12]. However, interpretation of the current data is clouded by potential contributions of human genetic variation, environment, and geographical factors [5,7,13]. While current evidence is consistent with the extent of lifestyle change impacting the gut microbiome [14], to what extent shifts in lifestyles away from a foraging lifestyle influence gut microbiomes remains poorly understood. Moreover, whether shifts in lifestyles influence gut microbiomes in preindustrial populations remains poorly understood.

In order to explore how a gradient of traditional lifestyles may affect the human gut microbiome, we have analyzed the gut microbiomes from four rural Himalayan populations. The Himalayan populations include the Chepang (a foraging population), the Raute and Raji (two foraging communities that are currently transitioning to subsistence farming), and the Tharu (former foragers that have completely transitioned to farming within the last two centuries). We assessed contributions of lifestyle, diet, and environment on the gut microbial variation in the rural Himalayan populations. To further assess how the gut microbiomes of these traditional groups differ from an industrial population, we compared them to Americans with European ancestry. Our results show that gut microbiome composition mirrors the transitions from a traditional to an agrarian lifestyle in Himalaya. In addition to the dietary gradient across these populations, intra- and interpopulation variability in lifestyle elucidated additional environmental factors that may contribute to microbiota change.

Our participants included 54 individuals from four Himalayan groups, including Chepang (N = 14), Raji (N = 9), Raute (N = 11), and Tharu (N = 20), with median age of 40 years (SD ± 14 years) from rural villages in Nepal (Fig 1 and S1 Table). These four populations are long-term residents of the Himalayan foothills (altitude less than 1,000 m). Ethnographic, linguistic, and cultural data suggest that these populations are of East Asian ancestries, they speak closely related languages, and their cultural practices are similar to one another [32–34]. Although all four of the Himalayan populations in this study were foragers until recently [35–38], habitat loss due to rapid deforestation, population expansions of non-native groups, establishment of new settlements, and construction of modern highways led to settlement of these groups at various time points in the last 300 years. Historical records indicate that the Tharu gradually transitioned into agrarian lifestyles beginning in the late 18th century (250–300 years ago) [38]. They have fully transitioned into farming and are virtually completely disengaged from foraging practices. The population size of the Tharu is approximately 1.5 million, and they are distributed throughout the Terai plains in Nepal [39]. Historically, the Raute, Raji, and Chepang were seminomadic foragers, and their diets included native tubers, greens, and fruits from the jungle and wild honey, fish, and occasional game [36,37,40]. The Raute and Raji abandoned their foraging lifestyles in the 1980s [35,36]. While the Raute have settled in the remote hills in western Nepal, the Raji have settled in the Terai plains, which are relatively more urbanized. The current census size of Raute and Raji are approximately 650 and approximately 3,750, respectively [39]. The Chepang were fully nomadic at least until 1848 [41] and began supplementing their foraging practices with subsistence agriculture less than a century ago [37]. The Chepang population size is approximately 48,500 [39]; however, they exist as fragmented tribes in small, geographically isolated villages of a few hundred individuals deep within the hills of lower Himalaya. The Chepang in this study currently inhabit a remote village that is devoid of modernity, with no electricity, running water, irrigation, fertilizers, modern machines, or marketplaces. They still practice slash and burn agriculture and are completely dependent on rainwater for farming. Because yields from such traditional farming are low, their daily diet consists of wild plants such as sisnu (nettles) that are foraged from the forests.

We conducted surveys to assess the extent of lifestyle change as these seminomadic populations transitioned to farming in the last few hundred years. The survey questionnaire included questions pertaining to current dietary practices, traditional and modern medicines, and several environmental factors, including sources of drinking water, types of cooking fuel, alcohol use, and tobacco consumption (N = 53, S2 Table). We also surveyed presence of parasites in our participants microscopically.

A total of 10 variables contributed highly to the first two CA dimensions, and most of them are strongly associated with dietary differences and modernity (Fig 2C). These differences are described in detail in S2 Fig. Briefly, foraged plants such as sisnu (nettles) and jaand, a slushy alcoholic beverage made from fermenting millet or corn, are staples of the Chepang diet. In contrast, sisnu and jaand consumption was minimal among the Raute, Raji, and Tharu. Also, perceived food scarcity was higher in the Chepang and Raute relative to the Raji and Tharu. Although meat consumption was low across all four populations, the Tharu consumed animal products such as yogurt more frequently than the other three populations. Furthermore, the Tharu and Raji also showed increased signs of modernity. For example, they have installed tube wells at their homes, enabling access to underground water for drinking. In contrast, the Chepang and Raute still fetch drinking water from rivers and streams. Also, use of solid biomass fuel was lower in the Tharu and Raji, while the Chepang and Raute are still completely dependent on burning firewood for cooking. Although we detected low overall levels of intestinal parasites across the participants, Ascaris, Entamoeba, Trichuris, Hymenolepis, and Coccidia were detected in some, and most of the infected were the Chepang. Together, the diet and lifestyle assessments provide unbiased support that the four populations represent a gradient from traditional to increasingly agrarian and urban lifestyles.

In order to assess whether the gut microbiome varies across lifestyles, we characterized the gut bacterial composition of these populations using the Illumina MiSeq to sequence the V4 region of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene obtained from a total of 79 stool samples (including technical replicates), with an average of 11,570 (±4,653) high-quality reads per sample (S3 Fig and S4 Table). Since flash freezing of the samples was not possible in the remote sampling areas in the Himalaya, we used commercially available DNAGenotek OMNIgene kits to collect stool samples from the four populations (N = 54). We also collected stool samples from 10 Americans of European descent using OMNIgene kits and compared them with freshly frozen samples to evaluate whether the preservation method affected the microbiome profile. The 16S rRNA profiles of the same samples stored by flash freezing or by OMNIgene were remarkably similar, with reproducible differences in minor taxa (Euryarcheota and Cyanobacteria), demonstrating the reliable preservation of microbiome composition with the OMNIgene kits (S4 Fig). Due to the reproducible, albeit minor, differences between the two collection methods, we used the OMNIgene data from the Americans for consistency in subsequent comparative analyses. The American samples provide a thoroughly investigated population as an industrialized reference for the Himalayan data.

To formally evaluate whether variation in gut microbiota reflects lifestyle differences within Himalaya, we assessed associations between the respective primary dimensions from the lifestyle questionnaire, parasite analysis (CA1), and gut microbial composition analysis (PCoA1 calculated using the four Himalayan populations) (Fig 3C and S5 Fig). We found that the CA1 was strongly correlated with the PCoA1 obtained from all of the three distance matrices (Spearman’s Rho = 0.47, 0.44, and 0.28 for Bray–Curtis; unweighted UniFrac; and weighted UniFrac distances, respectively; P values = 4.5 × 10−4, 1.1 × 10−3, and 0.05; correlation test). The CA1 was also correlated with PCoA2 of all three distance matrices (Spearman’s Rho = 0.26, 0.44, and 0.39; P values = 0.06, 0.001, and 0.004 for Bray–Curtis; unweighted UniFrac; and weighted UniFrac distances; correlation test). Conversely, no significant correlations were detected between CA2 and either of the PCoA axes from all three distances (P value > 0.05, correlation test). Notably, CA1 but not CA2 is associated with lifestyle gradient in Himalaya (Fig 2). Strong and consistent correlations between CA1 and PCoA axes indicate that gut microbiome compositions of the Himalayan populations mirror their lifestyles.

Previous studies have suggested that elevated species diversity in the gut microbiome is a hallmark of traditional populations [19,24]. We assessed the alpha diversity in the five study populations using species richness and Shannon’s H at various rarefaction depths ranging from 10–6,500 reads (Fig 4). Species richness measures the presence and absence of taxa, whereas Shannon’s H additionally accounts for the relative abundances of each taxon within each population. We compared alpha diversity across the five populations at a rarefaction depth of 3,000 to include all 64 samples and at a higher rarefaction depth of 6,500, which included 61 samples. Regardless of the rarefaction depth, species richness was not significantly different between any of the five populations (P > 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis test). We did find marginally significant differences in Shannon’s H between these populations (P = 0.01 and 0.03 at 3,000 and 6,500 rarefaction depths, Kruskal–Wallis test). A posthoc pairwise comparison of all five populations showed that only the alpha diversity in the Tharu was slightly lower than that in the Americans (FDR adjusted P = 0.02 and 0.045 at the two rarefaction depths, respectively; Dunn’s posthoc test). Next, we evaluated association between the 10 factors that differentiate the lifestyle of the Himalayan populations (Fig 2) with the two alpha diversity measures. Neither species richness nor Shannon’s H were significantly associated with any of these factors at either rarefaction depth (P > 0.05, nonlinear mixed effects model). Finally, we assessed additional metrics of diversity (Fisher’s alpha, Simpson’s D), which similarly fail to differentiate populations (S9 Fig). These results indicate that lifestyle differences among the Himalayan populations or between these populations and Americans have little effect on the alpha diversity of their gut microbiome.

Although lifestyle differences have little effect on the alpha diversity, gut microbiome compositions of the Himalayan populations reflected the gradient in their lifestyles. To identify taxa driving the differences in the gut microbiomes across lifestyles, we compared the abundance of individual phyla across the five populations using a negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM), as implemented in differential expression analysis for sequence count data version 2 (DESeq2) [42]. Differential abundances were detected for six out of 10 phyla (FDR adjusted P values are shown in S6 Table), and four of the six phyla reflect a traditional western lifestyle gradient. The Himalayan populations were characterized by higher abundance of Proteobacteria, while abundances of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Verrucomicrobia were highest in the Americans, intermediate in the farmers (Tharu, Raji, and Raute), and lowest in the Chepang foragers (Fig 5A). Higher levels of Proteobacteria and lower levels of Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia are common features of many traditional human gut microbiomes around the world [19,21,24,29].

To characterize the taxonomic differences between populations at a finer taxonomic level, we repeated the above analysis at the genus level and identified 52 out of 116 genera that showed significant differences in abundance across the five populations (Fig 5B, FDR adjusted P values are shown in S7 Table). The majority of these genera show consistent differences along the lifestyle gradient within the Himalayan samples (Fig 5B). For example, among the Himalayan populations, the Chepang foragers were enriched for Ruminobacter, Campylobacter, and Treponema relative to the Tharu farmers (S10 Fig). Although we did not detect significant differences in the abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum across these populations, several members of this phylum distinguished the Himalayan and American populations. The rural Himalayan communities were enriched for Prevotella, Alloprevotella, and Anaerophaga and significantly depleted in Bacteroides, Alistipes, Butyricimonas, Odoribacter, and Barnesiella. 29 genera belonging to Firmicutes differed significantly across the five populations, and their distribution was complex across these populations (S11 Fig). The Himalayan populations were enriched for Clostridium sensu stricto, Catenibacterium, Lactobacillus, Bulleidia, Sarcina, Enterococcus, Eubacterium, Oribacterium, Mogibacterium, Mitsuokella, Allisonella, Weissella, Papilbacter, and two unknown genera of Erysipelotrichaceae and Veillonellaceae families. Alternatively, abundances of several Clostridium genera, Oscillibacter, Blautia, Butyriciococcus, Anaerostipes, and Flavonifractor were elevated in the Americans. The Americans also showed highest abundances of Bifidobacterium (Actinobacteria) and Akkermansia (Verrucomicrobia), both of which were extremely low in the Chepang foragers and intermediate in the Tharu farmers. Elevated abundances of Treponema and Prevotella with reduction of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium is a characteristic feature of gut microbiomes of foraging communities [19,21,24,29].

In addition to the individual taxa that differ across subsistence strategies, we wanted to determine whether microbial networks are also associated with lifestyle differences [24,43,44]. To understand how the gut microbiome network structure varies across these populations, we calculated the correlations between all pairs of bacterial genera in the gut using Sparse Correlations for Compositional data (SparCC) [45]. Clustering based on these correlations revealed seven bacterial coabundance groups (CAGs, S12 Fig). The dominant genera that defined these CAGs are Ruminococcus, Bacteroides, Roseburia, Escheria/Shigella, Suturella, Prevotella, and Dialister (Fig 6A and S13 Fig). These seven CAGs showed two antagonistic clusters: one cluster contains CAGs defined by Ruminococcus, Bacteroides, and Roseburia, and the second cluster contains CAGs defined by Prevotella, Escheria/Shigella, and Dialister (S13 Fig). Notably, the CAG dominated by Prevotella is most prominently represented in the Chepang and Raute, while members of the CAG dominated by Bacteroides are elevated in the Raji and Tharu (Fig 6B). Within the Prevotella CAG, Treponema and Ruminobacter are characteristic of the Chepang foragers. Conversely, the American gut is highly depleted of the Prevotella CAG and is dominated by the Bacteroides CAG. The results suggest how these changes in the microbiome that accompany lifestyle transitions may be viewed both at the level of individual taxa as well as higher-order community structure. Transitions from foraging to farming in Himalayan populations show changes in gut microbial networks, which appear to become more profound in industrialized societies.

We next assessed whether any of the 10 dietary and environmental factors that differentiate the Himalayan populations (from Fig 2) correspond to the variation in gut microbiome composition. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that the 10 factors collectively explain 28% of the gut microbiome variation within Himalaya, while 72% of the variation remained unexplained. Of the 10 variables, the source of drinking water and use of solid biomass fuel were significantly associated with the gut microbiome composition in the Himalayan populations (P value = 0.009 and 0.028, respectively; permutation test). Both of these factors contributed most to the first CCA axis (CCA1), which distinguished the Chepang and Raute individuals who drink river water and exclusively burn solid biomass fuel for cooking from the Raji and Tharu who drink underground water and use biogas for cooking (Fig 7). As an alternative approach, we assessed associations between the gut microbiome composition of the Himalayan individuals (using Bray–Curtis, unweighted UniFrac, and weighted UniFrac) and the 10 lifestyle-associated factors by performing a PERMANOVA (S14 Fig). These analyses also revealed that drinking water was strongly associated with the gut microbiome variation within Himalaya (P = 0.001 for all three distances; effect sizes = 0.096, 0.1095, and 0.088 for Bray–Curtis; unweighted UniFrac; and weighted UniFrac distances, respectively). Individuals who drank river water had higher abundances of Treponema, and those who drank underground water had elevated levels of Fusobacterium (FDR adjusted P value = 0.01 and 0.003, respectively; Mann–Whitney test). Although cooking fuel was significantly associated with overall composition, none of the individual genera reached statistical significance after correcting for multiple testing.

To assess whether the association between gut microbiome and drinking water extend beyond the Nepali populations, we reanalyzed an independent 16S rRNA amplicon data set from Hadza hunter–gatherers from the Hukamako camp (N = 60) [21]. In the late dry season, the Hadza use water from two distinct sources—springs (N = 22) and streams (N = 38). We used a CCA to assess the associations between the gut microbiome of the Hadza and several dietary and environmental factors, including 72-hour recall of baobab, berries, honey, maize, meat, and tuber consumption; alcohol and cigarette use; as well as differences in drinking water sources (S8 Table). These variables collectively explained 16.5% of the gut microbiome variation in the Hadza gut microbiome. Among the variables used in the CCA, difference in drinking water source was most strongly associated with the Hadza gut microbiome composition followed by honey consumption (P = 0.0001 and 0.03, respectively; permutation test; S15 Fig). We also performed a PERMANOVA to assess associations between the gut microbiome composition of the Hadza individuals and their dietary and environmental factors using Bray–Curtis, unweighted UniFrac, and weighted UniFrac distances. All three analyses revealed the association between drinking water source and the Hadza gut microbiome (P = 0.001, 0.002, and 0.003, PERMANOVA; effect sizes = 0.051, 0.051, and 0.059 for Bray–Curtis, unweighted, and weighted UniFrac distances, respectively; S15 Fig). Therefore, our results in the Hadza and the Himalayan populations suggest that drinking water is strongly associated with the human gut microbiome and emphasize the need for additional work to elucidate the mechanisms by which drinking water may influence the gut microbiome.

Several previous reports show that gut microbiomes of traditional populations vary from those of populations living industrialized lifestyles [15,16,18–20,24–27,29,30]. These studies have emphasized that gut bacterial composition differs between these populations, alpha diversity is higher in traditional populations, and diet may be the primary driver of variation in the human gut microbiome. Contrary to previous studies, our work focuses on how the extent of departure from a foraging lifestyle may affect the human gut microbiome. In this study, we compared the gut microbiome from four rural Himalayan populations that led nomadic lifestyles until recently and transitioned to farming at various time points in the last 300 years. Although the individuals in our study have historically cohabited a geographically small region (less than 150,000 sq. km) in the Himalayan foothills and shared similar diets until recently, their current diets and lifestyles vary. Our results demonstrate that their gut microbiota strongly mirrors their lifestyles, indicating that the human gut microbiome can undergo pronounced changes within a short time (decades) of departure from foraging, as seen in the Raute and Raji. As dependences on agriculture increases, these changes become more pronounced, as seen in the Tharu. Since these populations cohabit comparable latitudinal regions, such changes in the gut microbiota are unlikely to be confounded by geography. Therefore, our findings suggest that a range of lifestyle changes more subtle than those associated with industrialization are strongly associated with alterations of the gut microbiome.

In conclusion, our results emphasize the need to study additional traditional populations to understand how geography, climate, diet, and environment affect the gut microbiome. The global trends of bacterial taxa within the gut that undergo depletion or enrichment upon lifestyle transitions are striking. Incorporating metagenomics to characterize the gut microbial variation at finer scales, metabolomics and strain culturing to assess functional differences, and immune and metabolic profiling of these populations may reveal the functional consequence of these changes, both in terms of the intrinsic microbial ecology of the gut and the impact on human biology. Pursuit of mechanisms by which the gut microbiome interacts with human biology may reveal conserved connections with large implications for industrialized humans who lack these microbes that may have been part of our species’ evolution.

This work was approved by the Ethical Review Board of the Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC) as well as by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board.

Stool samples were collected with informed consent from 56 genetically unrelated adult participants (over 18 years old with different grandparents) from four indigenous Himalayan populations from Nepal and 10 adult Americans of European descent. Indigenous populations from Nepal included Chepang (N = 14), Raji (N = 10), Raute (N = 12), and Tharu (N = 20) inhabiting Chitwan, Bardia, Dadeldhura, and Sarlahi districts, respectively. The samples were collected in winter of 2016 (March and April) with consent from all participants.

In addition to collecting the fecal samples, we also obtained ethnolinguistic, demographic, environmental, and dietary data from the Himalayan participants using a survey questionnaire specifically designed for this study. The survey questionnaire assessed participants’ age, gender, diet, health status, use of medication, and behavioral practices such as tobacco and alcohol consumption, along with several environmental variables (S2 Table). In addition, we also visually inspected the stool samples of each individual under the microscope for the presence of intestinal parasites (triplicate slides per individual). Participants’ responses to survey data questionnaires are included in S4 Table.

Freshly produced stool samples from the Himalayan participants were collected on a clean OMNIgene gut accessory collection paper (OM-AC1). About 500 mg of the stool samples was transferred to the OMNIgene gut kit collection tube containing the stabilizing buffer using the clean spatula provided with the kit. The tubes were shaken hard in a back and forth motion until the fecal samples were completely homogenized. Tubes were transported at room temperature within 48–72 hours of collection to the Tribhuvan University Institute of Medicine, Kathmandu, Nepal, where they were transferred to −80 °C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted using a MolBio Power Soil Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Extracted DNA was shipped to Stanford University on dry ice and stored at −20 °C until sequencing. Samples from Americans were collected from volunteers at Stanford University in 15-ml centrifuge tubes and transported to the laboratory on ice. Half of each sample was immediately frozen at −80 °C. From the other half, 500 mg stool was transferred to OMNIgene collection tubes and kept at room temperature for 48–72 hours after which they were stored at −80 °C. DNA was extracted from both sets of samples simultaneously using the MolBio Power Soil Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol and stored at −20 °C until sequencing.

The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified using the primers and protocols described previously [55]. The amplified DNA fragments were multiplexed and subjected to paired-end sequencing using Illumina MiSeq. Of the 66 samples, one yielded very low levels of DNA and another failed the paired-end sequencing. After discarding these two samples, the final data set included 64 individuals (14 Chepang, 9 Raji, 11 Raute, 20 Tharu, and 10 Americans). The amplification primers and barcodes used for multiplexing are described in S4 Table.

A total of 1,183,760 merged reads passed quality control, and 1,630 taxa were initially identified. After removing chimeric sequences, which constituted 22% of the reads, 921,345 merged reads remained. Further elimination of low-abundance phyla—Synergistetes and Deferribacteres—that were observed only once across all samples resulted in 883 taxa in the data set. After quality control, mean (±SD) sequencing depth per sample was 11,570 (±4,653). We performed three technical replicates of the frozen sample for one individual and a total of five replicates for two additional individuals for the OMNI samples. Since we did not observe marked differences in the technical replicates (S3 Fig), we retained the sample with highest coverage for these individuals. After removing the replicate samples, 64 individuals and 875 taxa remained in the final data set.

Stool samples and dietary recall from 60 Hadza individuals were conducted in the field at the time of sampling with the aid of an interpreter. Following informed consent, each participant provided a list of the plants, animals, and animals products consumed over the previous 72 hours, including alcohol and cigarette use. Location and type of water source was also recorded. Although the Hadza consume water primarily from a single source near their camp, foraging activities often take subjects several kilometers away from camp where their water source may vary. Raw 16S reads from the Hadza were previously published [21] and were processed using DADA2, as described above. This data set included 1,038,333 nonchimeric reads from 60 individuals that were assigned to 1,511 taxa.

A random forest classifier with 5,000 trees was constructed using all 35 variables (S3 Table) from the survey data. The R-package randomForest [62] was used to build the trees, and its “tuneRF” function was used to assess the optimal number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split. (“mtry” parameter, mtry = 6 for survey data). We also repeated these analyses on the 16S data using the RSVs as features and using mtry = 29 as determined by the tuneRF. The R-package “pROC” [63] was used to calculate and plot the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for each of the populations. In addition, brier skill scores (BSSs) in R-package “verification” [64] was used to assess the calibration of the RF model.

Intestinal pathogens and all 35 variables recorded from the Himalayan populations were used to perform CA of the survey data using “FactoMineR” package in R [65]. Associations between rows and columns in the correspondence analysis were evaluated by performing a chi-squared test (P = 3.9 × 10−6). The contributions of each factors to the top two dimensions of CA were visualized using the “fviz_contrib” function in R-package factoextra [66]. The expected contribution to the top two dimensions under a uniform model was determined, and factors that contributed more than the expected were considered important in differentiating lifestyles.

All multiple testing corrections were performed by computing FDRs using the Benjamini–Hochenberg method, and adjusted P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. A phyloseq object containing the 16S data and metadata as well as the analyses protocols used in this work are included in the supplementary data.
