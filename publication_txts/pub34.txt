Gut Microbiota in Psoriasis

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with autoimmune pathogenic characteristics and is caused by chronic inflammation, which results in uncontrolled keratinocyte growth and defective differentiation. The link between the gut microbiota and immune system regulation opened a novel angle to understand the pathogenesis of many chronic multifactorial diseases, including psoriasis. Current evidence suggests that modulation of the gut microbiota, both through dietary approaches and through supplementation with probiotics and prebiotics, could represent a novel therapeutic approach. The present work aims to highlight the latest scientific evidence regarding the microbiome alterations of psoriatic patients, as well as state of the art insights in terms of microbiome-targeted therapies as promising preventive and therapeutic tools for psoriasis.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with autoimmune pathogenic characteristics and a solid hereditary susceptibility. The majority of psoriasis cases include chronic plaque-type psoriasis (known as Psoriasis Vulgaris). Typical clinical symptoms are sharply defined, erythematous, pruritic plaques. These can cover large areas of skin as they consolidate. The scalp, trunk, and extensor surfaces of the limb are the common sites [1]. Psoriasis is caused by chronic inflammation, which results in uncontrolled keratinocyte growth and defective differentiation. Epidermal hyperplasia coexists with inflammatory infiltrates constituted of dermal dendritic cells, macrophages, T lymphocytes, and neutrophils in the histology of psoriasis plaques [2].

Numerous studies associate gastrointestinal health to skin homeostasis, with both the composition and function of the gut microbiota being disrupted in psoriasis patients [14,15]. The link between the gut microbiota and immune system regulation opened a novel angle to understand the pathogenesis of many chronic multifactorial diseases, including psoriasis. The present work aims to highlight the latest scientific evidence regarding the microbiome alterations of psoriatic patients, as well as state of the art insights in terms of microbiome-targeted therapies as promising preventive and therapeutic tools for psoriasis.

The gut microbiota is represented by a diverse collection of microorganisms found in the digestive systems of humans, and when compared to other sections of the body, it has the most significant number of microorganisms and the highest number of species [16]. This collection primarily consists of bacteria, but viruses and other eukaryotes invade the gastrointestinal tract shortly after birth [17,18]. The human gut microbiota begins to develop in the perinatal stage and is crucial to the regular functioning of the host organism [19]. It can produce several metabolic products when interacting with the host, positively or negatively impacting human health. The disruption of short-chain fatty acid production could have a variety of pathogenic repercussions for the host [20]. Moreover, patients with psoriatic arthritis [21] and multiple sclerosis (MS) have negatively changed SCFA levels, and the SCFAs could potentially affect the course and development of these diseases [22].

Diet is appreciated as the most potent modulator of both microbiota composition and function. It was revealed that dietary components have a beneficial impact on the host’s microbiota diversity [23]. Both vegetarian and low-calorie Mediterranean diets, rich in whole grains, probiotic foods, fruits and vegetables and bioactive dietary components, have been demonstrated to positively alter the host’s microbiota diversity; however, it is vital to note that both diets should persist longer than three months [24]. In contrast, a Western diet consisting of energy-dense, processed foods, high in fat and sugar, and low in fiber, decreased the diversity of the cecal microbiota, shifted its composition toward a pro-inflammatory profile by enhancing the Desulfovibrionaceae and Proteobacteria’s relative abundance, and altered the cecal metabolome [25]. Food additives frequently used in a Western diet, such as polysorbate 80 and carboxymethylcellulose, may disrupt gut homeostasis, contributing to tissue-damaging inflammatory responses [26]. Moreover, maltodextrin, a polysaccharide, causes endoplasmic reticulum stress in intestinal cells, decreasing mucus secretion and increasing the level of inflammation in mice models [27].

As presented in Figure 1, it is not only diet that impacts the gut microbiota. The physical activity and body mass index, mode of delivery and feeding in newborns, as well as the use of specific medication, especially antibiotics, are external factors that can change the composition of the intestinal microbiota [28,29,30,31,32]. Thus, in order to prevent such pro-inflammatory profiles and dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota, it is essential to make dietary choices and lifestyle changes that are associated with better outcomes in gut microbiota diversity and functions [33,34].

The gut microbiome’s diversity can have a significant impact on immunological development and disease risk, especially for autoimmune conditions, such as psoriasis [35]. Intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in psoriasis patients depends on the severity and status of the disease (Figure 2). Various studies show different results regarding the composition of the intestinal microbiota in psoriasis subjects. For example, levels of Prevotella spp. (species) were either higher [36] or lower [37] among psoriasis subjects compared to the healthy control. In both cases, intestinal dysbiosis was noticed. According to a study based on microbiota and inflammation-related variables, microbiota dysbiosis may produce an aberrant immune response in psoriasis. The microbiome changes were correlated with the degree of inflammation-related markers that were irregular in psoriasis patients, specifically the IL-2 receptor, which exhibited a positive relationship with Phascolarctobacterium and a negative relationship with Dialister. Phascolarctobacterium and Dialister relative abundances could be used as predictors of the psoriasis activity [38]. Moreover, complement 3 has a negative correlation with Escherichia level [38], which tends to be higher in psoriasis patients [39]. According to a study in Brazil that investigated the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota in 21 subjects with psoriasis, when compared to the control group, the psoriasis group showed a decrease in the Lachnospira and Akkermansia muciniphila species [40]. This decrease in Akkermansia muciniphila was also highlighted by another study that used 16S rDNA sequencing technology to examine microbiota composition in 14 psoriasis patients [41]. Such changes were linked to butanoate metabolism and butyrate production in the human colonic microbiota [42,43]. Butyrate has been implicated in the regulation of various inflammatory factors, including lipopolysaccharides, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-1β [44].

The gut microbiota presents an essential role in host homoeostasis and immune response, particularly in Th17 cells [54]. For example, according to the findings of a recent prospective, randomized trial, dietary treatments can cause solid and repeatable changes in the immune system, suggesting that they have the potential to enhance immunological status as well as gut microbiome function. Fermented food intake decreased 19 cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory serum proteins, including IL-6, IL-10, IL-12b [9]. Regarding IL-6, it was shown to be a predominant upstream signal for keratinocytes in mice with psoriasis-like dermatitis [55]. Curiously, adipocyte dysfunction was linked to metabolic syndrome and is related to an increase in the M1 macrophage population inside the adipose tissue. This could contribute to increased adipose tissue release of IL-6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that could subsequently promote insulin resistance via a variety of cellular signaling pathways, including mTOR and protein kinase C [56].

Biologic therapy in other inflammatory pathologies, for instance inflammatory bowel disease, might have a negative impact on the patients’ gut microbiota [57]. According to a transdisciplinary study published in “Arthritis & Rheumatology”, the use of an IL-17A inhibitor occurred in gut microbial dysbiosis and characteristics of subacute intestinal inflammation in a group of psoriatic arthritis and spondyloarthritis patients [58]. However, to date, only a few studies have investigated the changes in gut microbiota after antipsoriatic treatment.

Adalimumab (ADA), a TNF-α antagonist, was shown to be effective in the treatment of psoriasis, despite its possible adverse reactions [59]. Lihong Zhao et al. investigated the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in the treatment of psoriasis, as well as its impact on the gut microbiota. They evaluated changes in the pre-treatment and post-treatment intestinal microbiome composition in psoriasis patients following ADA medication and variations in the microbiome composition between psoriasis patients and healthy controls. The results showed no significant changes in the intestinal microbiome of patients before and after three months of ADA treatment [60]. Given the modest number of psoriasis participants included in this study (n = 13), long-term follow-up of patients treated with ADA and subsequent psoriasis research based on microbiota may provide further support for psoriasis treatment.

IL-17 inhibitor (secukinumab) and IL-12/23 inhibitor (ustekinumab) have already been proven to be effective in the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis [61].

Nevertheless, more research on the influence of antipsoriatic medication on the intestinal microbiota of psoriasis patients, with a greater number of participants, is needed to better understand this topic.

Current evidence suggests that modulation of the gut microbiota, both through dietary approaches and through supplementation with probiotics and prebiotics, could represent a new therapeutic target in autoimmune pathologies, for instance multiple sclerosis [64], celiac disease [65] and psoriasis [66]. In the following, we will discuss if the gut microbiota-targeted therapies, including dietary approaches and supplementation with bioactive dietary components, probiotics and prebiotics, could present health benefits in psoriasis patients.

The Mediterranean diet encourages a high consumption of plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, grains and olive oil, while reducing the intake of red meat, dairy products, and processed products [67]. Recent evidence suggests that adherence to the Mediterranean diet could also impact the inflammatory markers in autoimmune diseases [68] and may reduce the severity status of certain dermatological pathologies [69,70]. For instance, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, specifically the use of extra virgin olive oil as the primary fat in the diet, reduced the disease severity among patients with suppurative hidradenitis by reducing the Hurley stage and the severity score [71]. Moreover, adherence to the Mediterranean diet seems to be negatively associated with the severity of acne; thus, increasing the consumption of foods specific to the Mediterranean diet can benefit people with acne [70,72].

On the one hand, the anti-inflammatory effects of a Mediterranean diet could be explained due to a high intake omega 3 fatty acids present in the Mediterranean diet that were linked with favorable outcomes regarding their effects in psoriasis patients [73]. On the other hand, the Mediterranean diet could also enrich the gut microbiota diversity, including bacteria with anti-inflammatory properties [74]. The anti-inflammatory effects of the Mediterranean diet in psoriasis patients were discussed in a prospective questionnaire study performed by Céline Phan et al. [75]. It was revealed that low adherence to the Mediterranean diet was correlated with a more severe status in psoriasis patients; however, this study did not approach the gut microbiota’s role in the anti-inflammatory effects observed in psoriasis patients but more on the biologically active components present in the Mediterranean diet. The same results, with the same perspective, were also supported by a cross-sectional study in 2015, with a smaller sample of mild-to-severe psoriasis patients (n = 62), which can represent a limitation of the study [76]. The results showed that the PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) score, measured for the severity status of psoriasis, presented a significant association with the percentage of the C-reactive protein levels, which was negatively correlated with adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The fish and extra virgin olive oil intake were both independent predictors of PASI score and C-reactive protein levels [76]. Similarly, an energy-restricted diet intended to enhance the intake of omega-3 and decrease omega-6 PUFAs improved the metabolic profile and increased the responsiveness to immunomodulating treatment in obese psoriatic patients [73]. Regardless of whether the role of the diet in modulating the gut microbiota in psoriasis patients is not fully understood, considering that psoriasis patients usually tend to have a hypercaloric diet rich in processed foods, saturated fats, sugar and sodium with low nutritional quality and a high inflammation profile [77], it is essential to consider modifying dietary habits among these patients as an adjuvant therapy to the immunomodulating treatment.

Recent evidence shows that psoriasis corelates with celiac disease [78] and that patients with psoriasis present a higher risk of developing this autoimmune disease [79]. Thus, psoriasis patients must benefit from screening for celiac disease for a more precise and effective nutritional therapy regarding gastrointestinal and inflammatory symptoms.

Short-chain carbohydrates and sugar alcohols are restricted in the low FODMAP (which stands for fermentable, oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet. The restriction of these dietary components has been demonstrated to be beneficial in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome by significantly reducing the abdominal pain and bloating [85], but limited studies have addressed the effectiveness of a low-FODMAP diet in psoriasis patients. In mice, the reduction in dietary FODMAPs did not increase nor reduce inflammation. Moreover, it seems as if the microbiota profile changes were caused by inflammation rather than diet, and a low FODMAP intake resulted in proteolytic fermentation following inflammation [86]. Results from a randomized clinical trial that studied the effects of a low-FODMAP diet on fecal microbiome and inflammatory markers in patients with inflammatory bowel disease presented a reduction in the fecal abundance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, but no differences were observed with the inflammatory markers [87]. Although a gluten-free and low-FODMAP diet appears to be beneficial in managing the gastrointestinal symptoms and modulating the gut microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome [88], further research is required to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of such a dietary intervention on nutritional adequacy and the gut microbiome of psoriasis patients.

Probiotics are living microorganisms that can be found in fermented foods or nutritional supplements and provide beneficial health properties to the host when they are ingested or administered [89]. Probiotics enclose a wide range of microorganisms. Bacteria from the Lactobacillaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae families are the most frequent, but other bacteria, as well as yeasts, can be administered as probiotics [89,90]. In addition to probiotics, nondigestible dietary components, such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS), inulins, or galactooligosaccharides, promote the development of beneficial bacteria in the intestinal microbiota, and they are named prebiotics [91]. When ingested together from the same mixture or dietary supplement, they are called synbiotics [92].

Very few studies have investigated the effect of prebiotics or symbiotics among patients with psoriasis. For instance, a randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of a synbiotic, including Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium breve, B. longum, Streptococcus thermophiles and FOS, on the serum electrolyte levels in psoriasis patients. The result highlighted that Fe, Ca, Mg, P, Zn, and Na levels were greater at week twelve compared to the baseline in psoriasis patients. The authors concluded that such changes might occur due to an improvement in mineral absorption by favorable effects on the gastrointestinal system [108]. However, no changes in the gut microbiota were examined in this study. Consequently, while recent studies suggest encouraging effects of probiotic/prebiotic supplementation among psoriasis patients, further research with a more significant number of subjects and various bacterial strains and prebiotics is required for a more effective therapeutic nutritional strategy in those patients.

Non-essential biomolecules that are present in foods or dietary supplements (e.g., polyphenols, glucosinolates, curcumin, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid) can alter metabolic processes in the body and were shown to provide health benefits in many pathological conditions, including gut microbiota dysbiosis [109,110,111,112]. Recent studies show promising results regarding the efficacy of bioactive dietary components in autoimmune diseases, even if the mechanism of action is not fully understood [113].

The efficacy of bioactive dietary components in psoriasis patients was also questioned in several clinical trials, but none of them correlated these changes with the gut microbiota. Phenolic compounds, which have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties, have been related to the beneficial properties in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases [114]. For instance, after three months of treatment with 500 mg of an olive polyphenolic extract, the PASI score significantly decreased, with 25% in the psoriasis group receiving the supplement [115]. Accordingly, the polyphenolic extract from Abies alba improved psoriasis patients’ signs and symptoms by lowering the IL-1β production; however, the improvement was not significant. As previously found, a diet rich in polyphenols and polyunsaturated fatty acids was linked with modified gut microbiota composition [116]. Precisely, significantly increased microbial diversity was noticed with an increased number of Bifidobacteria. Lower diversity of Bifidobacteria is known to be associated with systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation of intestinal Th2 and Th17 cytokines [117].

Curcumin, a natural compound known for its anti-inflammatory activity, accumulates in the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration and may exercise its regulatory effect by modulating the microbial diversity and composition of the intestinal microflora [118]. For instance, changes in gut microbiota after curcumin supplementation were highlighted by a human randomized placebo-controlled trial that studied the impact of turmeric and curcumin dietary supplementation in 30 healthy subjects. The supplementation group received 6000 mg of Curcuma longa extract daily and the microbiota analyses were performed at the beginning of therapy and after 8 weeks. All of the participants had substantial changes in microbiota composition over time, as well as a personalized response to therapy. Most Clostridium spp., Bacteroides spp., Citrobacter spp., Cronobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., Klebsiella spp., Parabacteroides spp., and Pseudomonas spp. were uniformly increased in the responsive participants. The lower relative abundance of many Blautia spp. and the majority of Ruminococcus spp. were exhibited in both groups [119]. Furthermore, curcumin was demonstrated to be efficient for inducing mucosal immune cells with regulatory features in mice by significantly suppressing NFKB activation in the colonic epithelium and controlling the production of inflammatory mediators [120]. Furthermore, the number of butyrate-producing bacteria and fecal butyrate levels increased, as did the proliferation of CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and CD103+ CD8- regulatory dendritic cells [120]. The oral supplementation with curcumin in psoriasis patients was evaluated for twelve weeks, resulting in a significant reduction in PASI score with a decrease in IL-22 serum levels [121]. Interestingly, in the gut microbiota of chronic kidney disease patients, curcumin supplementation was linked with lower Escherichia spp. and Shigella spp., and a greater abundance of Lachnoclostridium. Besides these changes, lower plasma levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (CCL-2, IFN-γ, and IL-4), as well as lipid peroxidation, were also reported [122]. Moreover, the oral administration of curcumin at the same time with local phototherapy in patients with plaque psoriasis seems to induce a quicker and more progressive therapeutic response to the treatment [123]. Considering that these inflammatory pathogenetic mechanisms are similar to those found in psoriasis subjects [9,53], curcumin supplementation could represent a future perspective regarding the management of this pathology.

There is a link showing the influence of PUFAs on immunity via modulating the gut microbiota. For instance, the administration of flaxseed oil in rats resulted in a higher level of SCFA production and a better microbial diversity, with Lactobacillus, Firmicutes, Butyrovibrio, and Bifidobacterium being negatively linked with pro-inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, and TNF-α) [124].

Regarding the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in psoriasis, a recent randomized controlled trial performed by Kåre Steinar Tveit et al. [125] highlighted that supplementation with herring roe oil (containing 292 mg of polyunsaturated fatty acids omega-3) leads to a significant improvement in the PASI score in psoriasis subjects. However, no significant changes were observed at the levels of inflammatory markers [125]. Another 6-week randomized clinical trial, which included healthy subjects, highlighted that a daily dose of 500 mg omega-3 increased the Coprococcus spp. and Bacteroides spp. and significantly decreased Collinsella spp. At the same time, serum levels of iso-butyrate and isovalerate seemed to increase by the end of the study [126]. Curiously, high levels of Collinsella spp. characterize the fecal microbiota of psoriasis subjects [37], while SCFAs and branched SCFAs, such as iso-butyrate and isovalerate, are known for their anti-inflammatory effects [127]. Moreover, omega-3 PUFAs, which interfere with the synthesis of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids [128], suppress the transcription of inflammatory cytokines via inhibiting NFKB-mediated inflammation [129], which is similar to the processes underlying inflammation in psoriasis [53]. Therefore, omega-3 supplementation may benefit people diagnosed with psoriasis vulgaris in terms of regulating the pathophysiological process of inflammation via modulating the gut microbiota.

Resveratrol is a nonflavonoid polyphenol compound found in plants and is essential for its anti-inflammatory benefits [130]. More studies investigated the effect of resveratrol on the gut microbiota, showing promising results regarding the biodiversity and microbial composition, as well as an improved intestinal barrier function and a greater intestinal permeability [131,132,133]. For instance, in piglets, dietary supplementation of 300 mg/kg of resveratrol for 28 days led to an anti-inflammatory effect by down-regulating toll-like-receptor 4 mRNA in the intestine and lowering the release of critical inflammatory compounds (IL-1β, TNF-α), as well as increasing the secretion of immunoglobulin [134]. Favorable effects of resveratrol on the intestinal microbiota have also been found in mice experiments. Oral administration of resveratrol is able to enhance intestinal barrier function, while also reducing permeability and inflammation. The composition of the gut microbiota was drastically changed following resveratrol treatment. Resveratrol therapy restored dysbiosis in mice by increasing the abundance levels of Bacteroides, Alistipes, Rikenella, Odoribacter, Parabacteroides, and Alloprevotella taxa, indicating a possible function for the microbiome [133]. Moreover, resveratrol administration, 400 mg/kg resveratrol for 8 weeks, increases the population of the butyrate producers Blautia and Dorea in the Lachnospiraceae family in high-fat diet-fed rats [135]. The enrichment of the Lachnospiraceae family was also highlighted by another study performed on high-fat diet-fed mice administrated with 300 mg/kg/day resveratrol for 16 weeks [136]. As previously presented, psoriasis patients tend to have lower levels of Lachnospiraceae family and Blautia compared with healthy individuals [40,137]; thus, resveratrol supplementation could lead to improvements in gut microbial diversity among these patients.

Quercetin is a plant flavonol classified as a polyphenol flavonoid. It may be found in a wide range of fruits, vegetables, and leaves, seeds, and grains [138]. Many studies have previously shown the advantages of quercetin, especially regarding its anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective and immunosuppressive properties [139,140,141]. Recent research has begun to describe the influence of quercetin on the gut microbiota, due to an increased interest in this topic [131,142,143]. For instance, quercetin seems to ameliorate gut microbiota dysbiosis that drives hypothalamic damage and hepatic lipogenesis in monosodium glutamate-induced abdominal obesity mice. The quercetin therapy specifically reversed Firmicutes spp. and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was reduced following quercetin therapy. More than that, the authors confirmed a decrease in Lachnospiraceae and Ruminicoccaceae family, as well as an improvement in intestinal barrier function [144].

As presented in Table 1, most studies evaluating the effects of diet and biologically active compounds on the intestinal microbiome are still in the preclinical phase. Table 2 summarizes most of the clinical trials that address the efficacy of such supplements in psoriasis with favorable results regarding PASI score, proinflammatory cytokine levels, and beneficial results on the quality of life of these patients. However, the positive intestinal modulation of psoriasis patients in the context of supplementation with probiotics, prebiotics, and biologically active compounds may play a key role in the fortunate clinical trial outcomes.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) trials are more and more promising regarding the health benefits of inflammatory diseases. In 2015, Paul Moayyedi et al. showed that the FMT in active UC patients resulted in a greater microbial diversity along with the remission of the disease [148]. Promising results were also highlighted by Sudarshan Paramsothy et al. in an 8 week clinical trial. FMT increased gut microbial diversity and altered microbial composition by enhancing the Eubacterium hallii and Roseburia inulivorans species in active UC patients; all these changes along with the remission of the disease [149]. Moreover, FMT seems to be more efficient in treating Clostridium difficile infection compared with fidaxomicin [150]. The efficacy of FMT in psoriasis patients is still a research topic, but promising results from clinical trials have started to arouse interest. In a five week interventional clinical trial, a subject with plaque psoriasis and IBS was administrated FMT twice via endoscopy and colonoscopy. The body surface area, PASI score, dermatology life quality index, intestinal symptoms and serum level of TNF-α were all improved after the intervention with no adverse reactions observed [147]. No gut microbiota changes were measured, and the small number of subjects represents a limitation of the study. However, in peripheral psoriatic arthritis patients, FMT is not that efficient in treating the active disease [151]. Although FMT may bring some benefits regarding the severity of the disease in patients with psoriasis, more clinical trials are needed to demonstrate this and to investigate whether or not modulation of the intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in this process.

This review highlighted the strong connection between psoriasis and the gut microbiota with the final purpose of adding novel wisdom for discovering the relationship between the altered gut microbiota in psoriasis patients, but there are still challenges and limitations that further research should address. Firstly, there is a need for improving protocols regarding collection, transportation, storage and DNA extraction in both animal and human studies to allow for optimal comparisons between studies. Moreover, there are insufficient data on the potential therapeutic approach to modulating the gut microbiota for better outcomes in psoriasis patients. Despite the increasing number of studies that highlight the microbial disruption in psoriatic patients, the data regarding microbiota modulation are lacking, meaning that the therapeutic strategy in clinical practice is based on evidence from other inflammatory and autoimmune pathologies, where the ability of diet, prebiotic/probiotic protocols, and biologically active compounds to modulate the gut microbiota have been demonstrated, as well as the therapy experience.Given that the severity and status of psoriasis are closely related to alterations in the intestinal microbiome, maintaining a balance in bacterial species using the aforementioned modulating factors could be an effective way to prevent the aggravation of the disease in these patients. Thus, additional human studies that include an accurate nutritional evaluation and therapeutic protocols are required in order to better understand the relationship between diet and microbiota in psoriasis patients. We anticipate that comprehensive study will soon enable us to characterize the gut microbiota as a tool for many diseases including psoriasis, and will allow lifestyle interventions and other dietary protocols to serve as cornerstones in treating the microbiome alteration of psoriatic patients.
