Moody microbes or fecal phrenology: what do we know about the microbiota-gut-brain axis?

The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a term that is commonly used and covers a broad set of functions and interactions between the gut microbiome, endocrine, immune and nervous systems and the brain. The field is not much more than a decade old and so large holes exist in our knowledge.

At first sight it appears gut microbes are largely responsible for the development, maturation and adult function of the enteric nervous system as well as the blood brain barrier, microglia and many aspects of the central nervous system structure and function. Given the state of the art in this exploding field and the hopes, as well as the skepticism, which have been engendered by its popular appeal, we explore recent examples of evidence in rodents and data derived from studies in humans, which offer insights as to pathways involved. Communication between gut and brain depends on both humoral and nervous connections. Since these are bi-directional and occur through complex communication pathways, it is perhaps not surprising that while striking observations have been reported, they have often either not yet been reproduced or their replication by others has not been successful.

We offer critical and cautionary commentary on the available evidence, and identify gaps in our knowledge that need to be filled so as to achieve translation, where possible, into beneficial application in the clinical setting.

Communication between the gut and brain occurs constantly, largely at a subconscious level, and plays a critical role in maintaining optimal health. Indeed, it is even suggested that defects in gut-brain axis communication are an underlying cause of functional bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [1] and potentially contribute to inflammatory bowel diseases [2]. This gut-brain axis consists of “hard-wired” anatomical connections, involving vagal and spinal nerves, and humoral components provided by the microbiota and their products, gut tissues, endocrine and immune systems.

While the potentially paradigm shifting [13] implications of the microbiota-gut-brain axis have garnered much attention in recent years [14–16], we are, nevertheless, at the very early stages of our understanding of this field, and there is limited information, though much speculation, on the complex communication systems involved (Fig. 1).Here we briefly review our current understanding of the mutualistic relationship between gut microbes and the CNS, highlighting recent progress, while identifying gaps in our knowledge and limitations of current methodologies used to explore the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

The major afferent anatomical connections between the gut and the brain include vagal and spinal nerves, their ganglia and the spinal cord. However, within the gut, there are two types of sensory nerves; the extrinsic primary afferent neurons with somata outside the gut, and intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs) with somata within the gut wall. Recent research has identified that certain bacteria and bacterial components in the lumen of the gut can modulate both extrinsic and intrinsic intestinal sensory systems, with consequences for peristalsis, nociception, brain chemistry and mood [10, 11, 17–19] (Fig. 2). Clearly, better knowledge of the neuronal projection pathways by which such signals reach the brain is critical to understanding the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It is also important to emphasize that communication in this axis is bi-directional, and there is strong evidence that, for example, stress has a significant effect on the composition and function of the gut microbiota [20–23].

One of the key receptors responsible for pain perception in the gut is a member of the vanilloid receptor family, the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) [36]. The major cellular expression of TRPV1 in the gastrointestinal tract is in spinal and vagal primary afferent neurons [36]. In a recent investigation of the mechanisms underlying the anti-nociceptive activity of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 [37], it was demonstrated that introduction of this organism into the intestinal lumen decreased the firing frequency of nociceptive spinal fibres, but not vagal fibres in the mesenteric nerve bundle. Further investigation revealed that the anti-nociceptive activity of this L. reuteri strain likely rests on the ability of the organism to directly or indirectly act as a potent specific blocker of TRPV1 ion channels in extrinsic spinal primary sensory fibres and their corresponding DRG cell bodies. Of note, the antinociceptive activity of the L.rhamousus JB-1 strain was independent of TRPV1 antagonism. These findings suggest that the mechanism of action of anti-nociceptive bacteria may differ at the molecular level according to species and strains.

While neural pathways play an important role in the microbiota-gut-brain axis it is not known how bacteria in the lumen or mucoepithelial layer signal to sensory neurons in the gut. Enteroendocrine, and perhaps other epithelial cells, contain and release a variety of sensory mediators that might activate IPAN, vagal and spinal terminals within the intestine [38]. Putative sensory mediators include serotonin, substance P, somatostatin, CCK, GABA, ATP, and a range of hormones including leptin, orexin, [39, 40]. Two recent studies have identified that components of the normal microbiota regulate host gut serotonergic pathways {Reigstad [41, 42]. Previous studies had established that colonization of germ-free (GF) mice with normal human or mouse derived fecal microbiota significantly accelerates whole-gut transit. These changes in gut motility occur through a mechanism, dependent at least partially, on 5-HT3/4 receptor signaling, suggesting that the gut microbiota may modulate the gut serotonergic pathways of the host [43]. Reigstad et al. [42] utilized GF or humanized (GF colonized with human fecal microbiota) mice to investigate this phenomenon and demonstrated that while human- and mouse-derived complex microbial communities did not alter the sensitivity of the gut to exogenous 5-HT they did increase colonic tryptophan 5-hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) protein and tissue 5-HT concentration. This suggested that increased 5-HT production was responsible for the increase in gut transit time with colonization.

In an attempt to determine the mechanisms underlying the ability of the spore forming bacteria to promote peripheral serotonergic pathways, Yano et al. [41] assessed metabolite level changes in response to conventionalization and identified 47 metabolites that correlated positively with increased 5-HT production. They went on to test the ability of 16 of these metabolites to induce 5-HT in enterochromaffin cell cultures. Among these, α-tocopherol, butyrate, cholate, deoxycholate, p-aminobenzoate, propionate, and tyramine all enhanced 5-HT production [41]. Similarly, Reigstad et al. [42] demonstrated that butyrate and acetate caused concentration-dependent increases in TPH1 expression by an enteroendocrine cell line. Taken together these studies indicate the gut microbiota, and in particular spore forming Clostridia, promote peripheral 5-HT production and that a range of metabolites produced by the microbes can induce 5-HT production in vitro. Which, if any, of these metabolites is involved in promoting 5-HT in vivo remains to be determined. Furthermore, it is not known if there are any human conditions where a disrupted microbiota leads to modulation of the serotonergic pathways or that modification of conventional microbiota can boost 5-HT production in a physiologically meaningful way.

To date, the most of the evidence for modulation of the gut-brain axis by microbes comes from assessing changes in brain function and behavior following oral administration of specific bacteria that are often putative probiotics [16]. While an intact vagus seems critical to the ability many of such bacteria to modulate brain chemistry and behavior [10, 44], the underlying mechanisms of action are largely unknown. Host factors and environment, including resident microbiota, likely play an important role in determining the efficacy of “psychoactive” bacteria. Indeed, the ability of L. helveticus to attenuate anxiety-like behavior in mice was demonstrated to be genotype and diet-dependent [45].

Fucosylated HMOs, including 2′-FL, directly diminish colon motor contractions in an ex vivo model, suggesting a direct modulation of enteric nerves [58], while GOS have recently been demonstrated to directly modulate the immune system, altering dendritic cell function in vitro [59]. Further studies on the ability of specific oligosaccharides to influence brain chemistry and behavior will be required to discriminate between the microbial contribution of the prebiotic versus direct action on host tissues.

The effects of changes in the composition of the gut microbiota on behavior and brain chemistry have also been explored using antibiotic treatments. Bercik et al. [32] demonstrated that in adult BALB/c mice, oral administration of neomycin and bacitracin along with the antifungal agent primaricin lead to a transient change in the composition of the gut microbiota with associated changes in behavior, including increased exploratory drive and decreased apprehension in both the step down and light/dark preference tests. Antibiotic treated animals also had altered BDNF levels in the brain, being decreased in the amygdala while increased in the hippocampus [32]. Furthermore, these investigators showed that fecal transplantation from the NIH Swiss mouse strain (anxiolytic) to the more anxious germfree BALB/c strain within 2 weeks induced in the host the behavioural phenotype of the donor. Similarly, the reverse experiment in which BALB/c provided the donor fecal transplant to the NIH strain also reproduced in the recipients the donor phenotype. The nature of the molecules and/or microbiota responsible for this extraordinary alteration in behavior await exploration.

In a study by Bercik et al. [32] a causal relationship between antibiotic driven changes in microbiota and behavioral effects was inferred by the demonstration that, in contrast to oral antibiotic treatment, intraperitoneal injection of the antibiotics did not influence behavior. However, their results did not rule out local, direct, effects of antibiotics in the gut or the effects of longer-term administration. Given the extremely high concentrations of antibiotic that have been used to deplete and/or disrupt the microbiota in animal models, a careful investigation of direct effects on the ENS, epithelial cells and immune cells would seem to be prudent. Furthermore, it will be important to conduct studies utilizing clinically relevant doses of antibiotic to identify if “real world” levels of microbiota disruption, particularly during the neonatal developmental period, can have long-term consequences for brain function and behavior.

Notwithstanding the caveats of antibiotic use described above, antibiotic depletion when combined with fecal transfer a useful tool for exploring the effect of distinct gut microbiota compositions on the gut brain axis. The use of gut microbiota transfer into germ-free animals has been used previously to suggest that distinct behavioral traits of mouse strains may be transferred to germ free mice by the fecal microbiota [32]. However, the experimental use of germ-free mice has limitations. These animals are known to have, inter alia, altered brain chemistry, increased blood brain barrier permeability, an underdeveloped ENS, reduced peripheral 5-HT production, altered gut motility and physiology, and many immune system deficits [5, 6, 17, 41, 42, 76]. How these profound alterations in the physiology of germ-free animals influence the impact of specific transferred organisms is unknown, however fecal bacterial communities transplanted into either normal or germ-free mice do not necessarily replicate the donor community in composition and/or function [77].

Use of antibiotic depletion of the microbiota avoids these limitations of germfree status and the potential direct effects of antibiotics on the host can be mitigated by comparing microbiota with distinct compositions transferred into identically treated control animals. Using such an approach Bruce-Keller et al. [78] demonstrated that mice given the microbiota from donors fed a high fat diet had significant and selective disruptions in exploratory, cognitive, and stereotypical behavior compared with mice receiving control diet microbiota. These behavioral changes occurred in the absence of significant differences in body weight. The high-fat diet microbiota also disrupted markers of intestinal barrier function, increased circulating endotoxin, and increased lymphocyte expression of ICAM-1, TLR-2, and TLR-4. This study does suggest that changes in gut microbiota composition due to dietary changes can influence neurologic function and specifically that the microbiota may contribute to neurologic complications of obesity. However, one potential confounding factor of this study is that animals received by bi-weekly oral gavage with microbiota throughout the experiment. There is the potential that oral exposure to specific organisms within the gavaged microbiota may have effects on the nervous and immune system as they transit through the GI tract, that would not be influenced by changes in composition of resident microorganisms.

Given the potential for alterations in the gut microbiota to modulate and alter brain function and behavior via neural, immune and endocrine pathways, there has been an increasing interest in determining a microbiome profile, or specific “causal” organisms, associated with behavioural and neuro-developmental conditions such as autism, major depression and even perceived temperament in toddlers [79].

Similarly, exposure to immune challenge or valproic acid, which induce autism-like behavior in mice, also lead to shifts in the microbiome profile [97, 98]. This then begs the question, could host induced changes in the gut microbiota in turn modulate the host? A recent study by De Palma et al. [99] suggests this may be the case. These investigators demonstrated that, in mice, early-life stress alters the colonic microbiota composition, enhances hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA) and colonic cholinergic neural activity with associated anxiety-like behavior and behavioral despair. Using germ-free mice it was demonstrated that the enhanced HPA and cholinergic activity were independent of the microbiota. However, the microbiota were necessary, but not sufficient, for the induction of behavioral changes, indicating that a combination of host and microbial factors are required.

To propose a causal relationship between specific microbes or groups of microbes and mood or neurodevelopmental disorders there should be a viable mechanism through which these microbes might drive changes in brain function and behavior. This might include the production or reduction in the levels of specific metabolites. However, the simple ability of organisms to produce specific metabolites known to be neuromodulators is not enough: they must be shown to have physiologically relevant impact on the levels of these metabolites or to occupy a unique niche within the gut where localized production of these metabolites will influence the host.

The concept of microbial endocrinology [106] has now gained general acceptance. Originally coined in relation to observations that stress, via secretion of catecholamines, could influence the number of potential gut pathogens and influence their proliferation and virulence, the term was extended to include the suggestion that bacterial synthesis of neurotransmitters such as GABA, histamine and 5-HT, plays a role in mediating effects on the gut brain axis with potential impact on mood and behavior [107, 108]. Certainly, evidence that neurotransmitters produced by the host can influence the function of components of the microbiota supports the concept of shared signaling pathways. For example in the QseC sensor kinase of the pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a receptor for host derived epinephrine/norepinephrine activation which leads to transcription of virulence genes in the bacteria [23, 109]. Conversely there is increasing evidence that signaling molecules of quorum sensing systems, used by bacteria to communicate and coordinate their actions [110], can also bind to mammalian receptors, including taste receptors [111], and directly influence the host [111–113]. A very recent study also indicates that quorum-sensing peptides from Clostridium species can penetrate the blood brain barrier [114]. However, while the concept of microbial endocrinology is attractive and highly plausible, to date there is no evidence that disruption or change of the gut microbiota leads to significant changes in microbe derived neurotransmitters, or that these influence brain function. With the possible exception of histamine mediated effects of L. reuteri and L. rhamnosus on the immune system [115, 116], there is as yet no evidence that such neurotransmitters influence the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

Animal models provide powerful tools for identifying mechanisms of inter-kingdom communication that may influence the microbiota-gut brain axis. For such experiments, rodents, particularly the mouse, are probably the most commonly used models. As with all data obtained from studies in mice, caution must be exercised in extrapolating the potential significance to humans (For a comprehensive review of the strengths and limitations of mouse models in microbiome research see [117]). Specifically, the bi-directional communication between microbiota and host is host specific and thus even humanized mice, may not establish the same relationship with specific organisms as humans. Indeed, it has been concluded that certain taxa resident in the gut microbiota of the human are absent in the humanized mice and mice do not retain a complete profile of transplanted human fecal microbiota [118]. It has also been reported that the immune system of humanized mice does not mature normally [119].

Another equally interesting study investigated the gut microbiome in a well-characterized group of alcohol-dependent subjects admitted to hospital for withdrawal treatment [123]. A significant subgroup presented with increased intestinal permeability and marked disruption of gut microbiota composition whereas the remainder had gut permeability and microbiota similar to those of healthy controls. Dysbiosis was characterized by reduced levels in the anti-inflammatory bacteria FP and Bifidobacterium and associated with increased scores of depression, anxiety and alcohol craving. After alcohol withdrawal for 3 weeks, all biological markers as well as psychiatric assessments had improved in the patients without marked gut permeability. However, in the patients with increased gut permeability, while this aspect was restored to normal, the dysbiosis and anxiety, depression and craving scores remained. This study strongly suggests that the psychiatric symptoms were primarily associated with the altered gut microbiota.

There are major gaps in our knowledge regarding how the brain perceives signals from gut bacteria. What is the commensal-induced chemical code triggering ENS and vagal discharge associated with an anxiolytic response? Furthermore, how does the brain process and respond to the multiple signaling pathways relaying information from the microbiota? Consequently, to what extent does disruption of the microbiota or microbe-generated signals contribute to mood, cognition and the development and severity of psychiatric pathology?

Are we at the whim of our microbes? Or are we expounding “fecal phrenology”? Reality, no doubt, falls somewhere in between, but much more robust, reproducible research, particularly in human subjects, is required before we can confirm the promise of initial experimentation and identify the true implications and therapeutic potential of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.
