Inferring early-life host and microbiome functions by mass spectrometry-based metaproteomics and metabolomics

Humans have a long-standing coexistence with microorganisms. In particular, the microbial community that populates the human gastrointestinal tract has emerged as a critical player in governing human health and disease. DNA and RNA sequencing techniques that map taxonomical composition and genomic potential of the gut community have become invaluable for microbiome research. However, deriving a biochemical understanding of how activities of the gut microbiome shape host development and physiology requires an expanded experimental design that goes beyond these approaches.

In this review, we explore advances in high-throughput techniques based on liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. These omics methods for the identification of proteins and metabolites have enabled direct characterisation of gut microbiome functions and the crosstalk with the host. We discuss current metaproteomics and metabolomics workflows for producing functional profiles, the existing methodological challenges and limitations, and recent studies utilising these techniques with a special focus on early life gut microbiome.

The mammalian gastrointestinal tract accommodates one of the densest microbial populations known, the gut microbiome. Each mammalian species, including humans, has a unique microbial community that has coevolved with its host and is finely adapted to the species lifestyle [1]. The trillions of microbial cells, including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, archaea, as well as viruses, all take advantage of the nutrient-rich gut environment, but it is mainly bacteria for which there is evidence of benefits being provided to host physiology. Commensal bacteria augment host functions by breaking down indigestible food components, synthesising essential vitamins, stimulating the immune system, and protecting against invading pathogens [2], [3], [4]. Still, the nature of the relationship mammalian hosts share with their gut microbiomes is convoluted, and research has so far elucidated only initial clues of the functions involved in microbiome-host crosstalk.

In this minireview, we outline advances in gut microbiome characterisation using high-resolution liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) for large-scale profiling of proteins and metabolites. Initially, we discuss steps in a typical workflow used in LC–MS-based metaproteomics and metabolomics (Fig. 1). Although there are differences in microbial colonisation and dissimilar protein and metabolite profiles along the gastrointestinal tract [16], we concentrate on stool-based approaches because of their application for biomarker discovery and non-invasive nature. Furthermore, feces are a heterogeneous material rich in various macromolecules and small metabolites, introducing challenges for analysis using instrumental methods and subsequent computational workflows. We conclude the review with recent studies using LC–MS omics for gut microbiome characterisation in the pediatric population (Table 1), which have enabled deeper biological insights on microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions during early life.

The potential for exploiting the gut microbiome in biomedical applications is immense; however, host-microbiome molecular interactions are still largely uncharacterised. This is in part because of the microbiome multi-layered complexity. The gut microbiome configuration depends on a metabolically active microbial community (microbiota), which dynamically responds to fluctuating physio-chemical properties of the gut [17], the host control of its composition [18], and other potential factors influencing the host-microbiota interactions such as microbial pathogens and medications. Additionally, only a small portion of human gut microorganisms have been cultured in specialized laboratories, and most of the microbiota remains uncharacterised using cultivation techniques. Because of the latter, culture-independent approaches such as profiling taxonomical marker genes [16S ribosomal RNA gene for bacteria and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region for fungi] have gained a major foothold among methods for microbiota characterisation. Although amplicon sequencing based on 16S and ITS is limited to describing taxonomic composition, researchers can use bioinformatics methods such as PICRUSt (https://picrust.github.io/picrust) to predict the microbial community functional profiles based on the taxa found [19].

DNA sequencing techniques will continue to be indispensable in microbiome studies. Still, conclusions about microbiome function derived from metagenomics predictions must be treated as hypotheses requiring functional validation [24]. Despite an earlier belief that the gut microbiome functional profile is more stable and generally conserved, based on the bioinformatic annotation of putative protein-coding genes [25], studies measuring mRNA or proteins have demonstrated that the metatranscriptome and metaproteome display greater variability and sensitivity to perturbation when compared to the information content of the metagenome [26], [27], [28]. This is partly because of an imperfect coupling of the gut microbiome composition and function [29], which stems from complex regulatory networks along the gene-transcript-protein expression path. Although metatranscriptomics gives greater insights into the functional potential of the microbial community than metagenomics [26], not all transcripts are translated to proteins in the same manner. For example, timing of expression (transcriptional regulation) and various mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation, such as differences in mRNA stability, will affect transcript levels [30]. Similarly, protein abundance is a combined result of protein synthesis and degradation, the latter being ignored in metatranscriptomics. Accordingly, a popular strategy to gain insights into the microbiome function has been integration of DNA- or RNA-based information with high-throughput measurements of microbial metabolic products and proteins, i.e., metabolomics and metaproteomics.

Each microbial cell responds to the unique physicochemical conditions of the host by adjusting its protein synthesis, metabolism, and secretion of biomolecules that facilitate its adaptation to the environment. Proteins carry out most functions in the cell (e.g., catalysis of biochemical reactions, transport, maintenance of cell structure), and protein amounts reflect the cell's most recent activities. Metaproteomics, the characterisation of the entire set of proteins accumulated by all community members at a given point in time [31], has emerged as the most relevant approach to characterise gut microbiome function. In addition, metaproteomics can simultaneously detect host and microbial proteins and aid in the characterisation of host-microbiome interactions [32]. Besides proteins, the collection of small molecules found in feces, the fecal metabolome, can be seen as a recording of the recent chemical communication between the microbial community and its host. Metaproteomics and metabolomics thus provide insight into the metabolic and physiological state of both the host and microbiome, and give a direct description of their phenotypes (Fig. 2).

Functional characterisation of stool is an attractive option to assess human health and disease due to the non-invasive sampling nature and broad coverage of biomolecules reflecting different physiological processes. Both metaproteomics and metabolomics have been used in clinical research to discover biomarkers that might facilitate early detection and diagnostics of various diseases. For example, several studies demonstrated the potential of proteins and peptides present in stool as biomarkers for colorectal cancer and other bowel-related diseases in the adult population [33]. In the pediatric population, a few metaproteomics studies reported findings on promising protein biomarkers for gastrointestinal tract maturation [34], [35]. Further, detection of metabolites identified as key mediators of the interactions between the gut microbiome and the host during early life is critical for disease prevention. A potential biomarker for early prediction of disease risk is 12,13-diHOME, a linoleic acid metabolite produced by certain gut bacteria that was elevated in neonates who developed asthma during childhood [36]. On the other hand, indole-3-lactic acid has been associated with beneficial microbiota in infants, decreased inflammation in intestinal epithelial cells [37], and beneficial immunoregulation [38]. However, the above-mentioned metabolites were identified in small cohorts, and future studies must address their validation on a larger number of clinical samples. Overall, although there are still limited numbers of metaproteomics and metabolomics studies of human diseases, the methodologies and available analytical tools have been recently greatly refined and encourage further in-depth characterization of the gut microbiome.

General principles. The combination of liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful analytical method for large-scale identification and quantification of biomolecules. LC–MS can be used in a global discovery mode to identify thousands of compounds or in a targeted manner for detecting specific analytes at levels of a few parts per billion [39]. In a prototypical LC–MS experiment, a solution containing analytes of interest is first separated on an LC column to reduce sample complexity. Then, the LC effluent is directed to the mass spectrometer, where it is nebulised, desolvated, and ionised by an ionisation source, allowing small biomolecules to enter the gas phase as charged particles. By applying electromagnetic fields, the charged particles migrate under a high vacuum through a series of mass analysers, where they are sorted according to their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). The resulting peak patterns define a fingerprint of the original sample. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), an analytical setup where two or more MS acquisitions are arranged sequentially, is especially useful for analysing complex biological mixtures and when greater certainty of analyte identification is desired. In the first MS, precursor ions of selected m/z are isolated from the rest of the ions and fragmented by collision with an inert gas into product ions, which are mass analysed in the second MS. This transition from precursor to product ions is specific for each compound and distinguishes even minor changes in molecular structure [40]. Although this method provides a high degree of selectivity, some highly similar isomers still cannot be distinguished, and additional information (discussed in chapter 6 – Metabolite identification) or alternative methods (nuclear magnetic resonance) are required for structural elucidation.

Finally, all areas of mass spectrometry applications are currently being challenged when it comes to the standardisation of analytical workflows [52] as well as data and method transparency. Nevertheless, developments in the metagenomics community [53], [54] predict that the potential of mass spectrometry applications can be fully realised and LC–MS techniques more widely adopted as long as the community guidelines [55] and the FAIR, i.e., findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, principles are followed for reporting of methods, data, and software [56].

Sample storage and processing. Metaproteomics and metabolomics approaches based on LC–MS technology share similar sample collection and processing workflows, yet unique methodological and computational challenges exist for both techniques (Fig. 2). Among the biggest challenges of stool-based metaproteomics is sample processing. In addition to carrying a complex microbial community, the stool matrix comprises undigested food particles and various host components (see chapter 6 for the macromolecular composition of feces). Therefore, an appropriate sample processing protocol needs to be evaluated in the context of each study's aims and should consider unbiased methods for storage of collected samples, microbial protein enrichment, and protein extraction efficiency [57], [58]. Sample storage is a crucial step in any omic study because different storage temperatures introduce alterations to microbial profiles [59], [60]. Frozen intact stool material is more stable than frozen extracted proteins [61] and thus recommended for long-term storage. Several studies tested preservatives that maintain sample integrity at room temperature when immediate freezing is not possible, and the results indicated RNAlater as suitable for metaproteome preservation [62], [63]. However, these studies only examined environmental samples, and the effects of preservatives have not yet been characterised for stool-derived metaproteomes.

In summary, the complexity and heterogeneity of stool samples brings considerable wet lab challenges to the metaproteomics field, but tailored protein databases, combined search algorithms, and iterative workflows, improve protein identification. This was demonstrated in a recent multi-lab comparison of metaproteomics workflows, where the same samples were given to 7 different labs. Different wet lab processing protocols introduced a variability at the peptide level, which, however, largely disappeared at the protein level in downstream bioinformatic analysis [52]. Nonetheless, there are still substantial bioinformatics limitations in metaproteomics related to the identification of false positives and functional annotation of the data. Metaproteomics will benefit from standardised bioinformatics pipelines that reliably process metaproteome data within a short time frame and link protein sequence to the taxonomic and biochemical information available from community resources. Without a doubt, new efficient bioinformatics tools adapted to the complexity of microbiomes are the key for more routine application of metaproteomics.

Chemical complexity of feces. In addition to proteins, fecal matter contains other biomolecules that reflect the process of nutrition to which the gut microbiome significantly contributes. Feces contain typically between 60 and 85% of water, depending on the fiber intake, and the dry matter consists of microbial biomass (25–54%), shredded epithelial cells and mucus, undigested food residues, macromolecules (fiber, protein, DNA, mucopolysaccharides) and small molecules or metabolites [106]. The fecal metabolome refers to the collection of these small molecules, i.e., sugars, organic acids, amino acids, nucleotides, phenols, indoles, lipids, and hormones, all of which might have roles as signaling molecules, metabolic intermediates, or secondary metabolites [107]. Thus, the metabolome can be interpreted as a molecular signature of the host under certain physiological conditions and a record of the interactions between the host and the gut microbiome. A recent estimate suggested that gut bacterial products account for up to 90% of the fecal metabolome [107], reflecting the gut microbiota composition and explaining on average ∼68% of its variance [108]. Thus, the fecal metabolome is considered a functional readout of the microbiome [108]; however, some of the metabolites will be common for the gut microbiota and the host as feces contain a combined metabolic output of both.

In conclusion, high mass accuracy of state-of-the-art MS instruments and complementary analysis of molecular patterns are increasingly able to assign putative structures to the detected features despite the inherent challenges that metabolomics faces. But instrument advances can do little if the databases are not in constant improvement. As mentioned above, only 6810 metabolites in the Human Metabolome Database are annotated as being found in feces. This is possibly orders of magnitude below the real chemical diversity of the human gastrointestinal tract. Equally important is the development and improvement of metabolomics software tools, which still need to address many challenges associated with metabolite identification, diverse data types, and large volumes of data [133], [134], [135].

Stool metaproteomics and metabolomics have been used to study various diseases; yet, here we focus on their use for functional characterisation of the early life gut microbiome (Table 1). Understanding the establishment of the human gut microbiome during infancy is paramount for modern medicine because of its implications for long-term health [136], [137]. Numerous reports have demonstrated that mammalian systems are adapted to receive specific microbial signals necessary for optimal physiological development [138], [139]. Specifically for humans, an infant gut microbiome characterised by early bacterial colonisers from the genera Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides, adapted to utilise human milk oligosaccharides, appears to be a cornerstone of healthy development. Perturbations of the microbiome at the earliest time in life during maximal immune, metabolic, and neuroendocrine development predispose infants to non-communicable diseases caused by underlying defects in physiology [9], [140] as well as more frequent infections [141], [142], [143]. The biochemical processes that govern the microbial dynamics during gut colonisation remain a poorly understood yet exciting research frontier.

Time course metaproteomics had also been applied to specific actions of microbial eukaryotes within the gut microbiome [77]. This case study of low abundance microbial taxa characterised fecal samples from a premature infant with a documented Candida blood infection with the aim to describe the behaviour of the fungi in the human gut. Metagenomic sequencing confirmed the presence of C. parapsilosis in the infant's fecal sample, with indications of robust establishment and active function within the gut microbiome. Further, protein-derived metabolic activities of bacteria, fungi, and their shared activity showed distinct partitioning of function and cooperation between eukaryotes and prokaryotes within the community during early life. This study highlights the importance of characterising interkingdom interactions within the human microbiome, as these are essential components of the relationship between the microbiome and its host.

Omics based on LC–MS are gradually gaining momentum to identify with high precision functionalities of the gut microbiome. LC–MS analyses of stool assist in unravelling interactions between different microorganisms residing in the gut as well as those with the host, offering insights beyond taxonomic composition and genomic information. MS-based omics provide data that DNA sequences cannot; that is which proteins and metabolites are present and their quantitative information. In addition, identification of post-translational modifications is only possible by metaproteomics.

The combination of LC–MS techniques with DNA sequencing applied on longitudinal human studies has already led to the description of nuanced signatures of healthy and disease states. Still, several methodological and bioinformatics challenges persist, with stool sample chemical complexity, lack of standardised method, and incomplete databases being the main issues contributing to low metaproteome and metabolome coverages (Fig. 2). However, once the current challenges are overcome, it will be possible to fully define the intertwined metabolic networks of individual gut microbes and the human host.
