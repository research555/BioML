Diet diversity and environment determine the intestinal microbiome and bacterial pathogen load of fire salamanders

Diverse communities of symbiotic microbes inhabit the digestive systems of vertebrates and play a crucial role in animal health, and host diet plays a major role in shaping the composition and diversity of these communities. Here, we characterized diet and gut microbiome of fire salamander populations from three Belgian forests. We carried out DNA metabarcoding on fecal samples, targeting eukaryotic 18S rRNA of potential dietary prey items, and bacterial 16S rRNA of the concomitant gut microbiome. Our results demonstrated an abundance of soft-bodied prey in the diet of fire salamanders, and a significant difference in the diet composition between males and females. This sex-dependent effect on diet was also reflected in the gut microbiome diversity, which is higher in males than female animals. Proximity to human activities was associated with increased intestinal pathogen loads. Collectively, the data supports a relationship between diet, environment and intestinal microbiome in fire salamanders, with potential health implications.

The digestive system of vertebrates is home to a dynamic microbiome1,2, which forms a ubiquitous and complex symbiotic relationship with their host. This symbiosis has long been known to support the production of vitamins3, the chemical processing of indigestible chyme components by bacterial fermentation4, and degrading toxic substances5. Moreover, the gut microbiome was also found to play a role in the maturation of the immune system6 and even ecological adaptation7. The composition of the gut microbiome differs greatly among host taxa, as well as the primary factors determining it. For termites8 and non-human primates9, the gut microbiome is strongly associated with host physiology and phylogeny. For fish10,11, birds12,13, myrmecophagous mammals14, mice15 and amphibians16,17, host diet has been found to be one of the primary determinants in shaping microbial communities. Other factors, such as climate18, habitat19,20, and the host immune system21 also drive internal microbiome diversity of certain animal clades to some extent. Host diet not only serves as a source of potential gut colonists22, but also modulates gut microbiome dynamics23. Empirical studies on gut microbiomes and its relation to diet in additional species have the potential to further shed light on this delicate ecological balance.

In this study, we use DNA metabarcoding to profile both the diet and intestinal bacterial composition of fire salamander populations in Belgian forests. The aim is to provide detailed information on the diversity, relative abundance and prevalence of prey taxa found within fecal samples of fire salamanders, as well as the impact of diet, sex and geographical location on the gut microbiome.

A total of 20 prey taxa were identified, belonging to the phyla Mollusca, Annelida and Arthropoda.

Alpha diversity of the salamander diet did not differ between locations (Chao2 H2 = 0.013, p = 0.994; sub-OTU richness H2 = 0.016, p = 0.992) or sexes (Chao2 W = 99, p = 0.246; OTU Richness W = 108, p = 0.407). Beta diversity of the salamander diet showed a large overlap between sexes, as well as forests (Fig. 2a,b) and there was no significant difference in diet composition between sexes (PERMANOVA Pseudo-F = 1.20, df = 2. 30, p = 0.26), as well as locations (PERMANOVA Pseudo-F = 1.03, df = 2. 30, p = 0.41). Moreover, we found that the salamander body condition (SMI) did not correlate to the diversity of diet (OTU richness rs = 0.074, p = 0.640; Chao2 rs = 0.067, p = 0.694).

Within all fecal samples, we found 15 different bacterial phyla. Bacteroidetes made up the largest portion of bacteria at 47.8%, followed by Firmicutes at 32.1% and Proteobacteria at 15.3%. These three phyla made up 95.2% of all bacteria found in fecal samples. The remaining bacteria were identified as Verrucomicrobia (3.7%), Desulfobacterota (0.6%), Cyanobacteria (0.2%), Actinobacteriota (0.1%), Elusimicrobiota (0.1%), Deferribacterota (0.009%), Bdellovibrionota (0.006%), Patescibacteria (0.003%), Myxococcota (0.001%), Planctomycetota (0.001%), Fusobacteriota (0.001%), and others (0.001%). When comparing the fecal microbiome from salamanders captured in different forests, significantly more Proteobacteria and Elusimicrobia were observed in forest HG, as compared to forest M or S (Supplementary Table S1).

We included pathogens of the genera Flavobacterium, Chryseobacterium, Sphingobacterium, Aeromonas, Citrobacter, Yersinia, Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas as a proxy for pathogen load, given their known involvement in amphibian pathology45–55. The presence of potential pathogenic amphibian bacteria in the fire salamander gut microbiome was analysed at genus level (Supplementary Figure S2). We focused on eight genera well known to contain pathogenic bacterial taxa (Table
1). The total relative abundance of the eight pathogenic bacterial genera makes up less than two percent of the fire salamander gut microbiomal communities in forest M (0.5%) and S (1.4%), but more than 13% in forest HG. The relative abundance of the pathogen load is significantly higher in forest HG, compared to forest M (p < 0.0001). Similarly, a tendency towards increased pathogen load was observed when comparing forests HG and S (p = 0.8649). Comparison of beta diversity of the pathogen load between forests was analysed with PERMANOVA on Bray–Curtis distance and revealed a significant difference between locations (Supplementary Figure S3, Pseudo-F = 4.69, df = 2. 80, p = 0.0001).

A Mantel test revealed that dietary differences between individual salamanders are not similar to the microbiome differences (r = − 0.05, p = 0.747). Exploring the structure between diet and microbiome we found a co-inertia coefficient of 0.42, indicating that the two categories varied independently (p = 0.721). Furthermore, no correlation was observed between the alpha diversity (Chao1 index) of diet and gut microbiome (Supplementary Figure S4, Spearman’s rs = − 0.05, p = 0.748).

To estimate the accuracy of the DNA barcoding technique, validation studies have been conducted using feeding experiments of captive animals, where exact diet inputs were compared to fecal DNA sequencing outputs56–58. Whilst the species of prey could be successfully identified in these studies, the proportion of detected DNA varied and was not completely on par with the dietary proportions. Amounts of DNA in the fecal matter need to be exactly proportionate to ingested prey biomass, which is not always the case, due to biological and technical biases, such as different speeds of digestion, size of ingested prey, possible presence of multicopy genes, DNA degradation in fecal samples and availability of DNA reference sequences of potential prey in public databases59–61. Nonetheless, DNA sequencing of fecal matter is a more viable technique to identify soft-tissued, easily digestible prey59, and able to provide higher resolution than conventional stomach content analysis62,63. This technique has been applied successfully in unravelling diets for many species, including birds44,56, mammals59,64,65, fish66,67 and reptiles68, but so far has not been used for amphibians.

To conclude, this is the first study to investigate the correlation between the diversity of diet and gut microbiome of adult fire salamanders in Belgian forests, using high-throughput DNA metabarcoding techniques. We show that diet composition is driven by sex, and influences microbiome composition in the fire salamander intestine. However, no correlation was observed between diet diversity and gut microbiome diversity.

This study was carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines and all methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.

All samples were collected from October to November 2016 at three forest locations in East Flanders, Belgium. Heilig Geestgoed (hereafter HG), a 29.77 ha public forest in the municipality of Merelbeke with 9 ponds (latitude 50.946881, longitude 3.726310). Makegem (hereafter M), a 54.24 ha private forest in Harentbeekbos with 10 ponds (latitude 50.945331, longitude 3.714886) approximately 1 km from HG and finally Smetledebos (hereafter S) with 45.75 ha, a public forest with 4 ponds (50.976308, longitude 3.906562), approximately 22 km from all other forests. All locations from which the salamanders were collected consisted predominantly of beech trees (Fagus sylvatica) with minimal undergrowth. Permits for sampling and experimental protocols of fire salamanders were granted by Agentschap voor Natuur en Bos of East Flanders in Belgium, license number ANB/BL/FF-V15-00015. According to the Belgian and EU legislation (EU directive 2010/63/EU), the collection of faeces obtained after spontaneous defecation is not considered an animal experiment and therefore does not require the approval of an ethical committee. Permission for collecting the samples in the forests (public and private) were obtained from the owners in the framework of the UGent GOA project Scaling up Functional Biodiversity Research: from Individuals to Landscapes and Back (TREEWEB).

Fire salamanders were collected from each of these three forests. They were kept individually without food in sterile boxes (16 × 11 × 5 cm) with moist towel, air holes and hiding places for 1 to 3 days at 15 °C at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Ghent in Merelbeke and then returned to their exact same locality in the forest. All animals were weighed (to 0.1 g) and measured (to 0.1 cm). Scaled mass index (SMI) of body condition (

100. Animals were checked and the boxes were cleaned each day and any fecal samples were collected in Eppendorf tubes and frozen at − 20 °C until DNA extraction. In total, 60 fecal samples were collected from 49 individual fire salamanders. 13 individual fire salamanders were collected from forest HG (7 males, 5 females and 1 juvenile), 21 individuals from forest M (11 males, 6 females and 4 juveniles) and 15 individuals from forest S (9 males, 4 females and 2 juveniles).

DNA was extracted from all fecal samples with the MoBio PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Extracted DNA was stored at − 20 °C until further processing.

Sequencing methods were used as previously described101. The V9 regions of nuclear 18S rRNA gene were amplified using modified primers 1391F (5′-GTACACACCGCCCGTC-3′) and EukBr (5′-TGATCCTTCTGCAGGTTCACCTAC-3′)102. We performed index PCR with unique combinations of indexed forward and reverse primers for each sample using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For quantification of amplicon DNA concentration, we roughly assessed intensity of their signal on agarose gels and then added 2 to 6 µl to a pooled library. This library was gel-purified by cutting out the band of the correct amplicon size, and subsequently cleaned with Qiagen MinElute Kit. DNA concentration of the purified library was determined with a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer. The library was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform using MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 for 300 cycles in both directions, including 10% phiX. Sequences were processed with MacQIIME v1.9.1103, filtering the forward reads as previously described101. Quality filtered sequences were clustered into sub-operational taxonomic units (sub-OTUs) using the deblur workflow103,104; (https://github.com/biocore/deblur). Within this workflow, all sequences were trimmed to 150 bp and subsampled to 13,000 reads per sample. Sub-OTUs clusters with less than 10 reads were removed. Sequences of sub-OTUs were taxonomically identified through BLAST searches. Only potential salamander prey items were selected from the 18S data, discarding sub-OTU reads from taxa such as Bacteria, Fungi and Protists. Prey taxa were identified into the main taxa: Gastropoda, Diplopoda, Chilopoda, Arachnida (Acari and Opiliones), Crustacea, Annelida (Lumbricidae), and six insect clades: Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Dipera, Coleoptera, Blattodea and Collembola (Supplementary Table S2).

The V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using gene-specific primers S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17 and S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21105. The PCR amplification procedures were performed according to a previous study106. The final barcoded libraries were combined to an equimolar 10 nM pool and sequenced with 30% PhiX spike-in using the Illumina MiSeq v3 technology (2 × 300 bp, paired-end) at the Oklahoma Medical Research Centre (Oklahoma City, USA). Demultiplexing of the amplicon dataset and deletion of the barcodes was done by the sequencing provider. Quality of the raw sequence data was checked with the FastQC quality-control tool (Babraham Bioinformatics, Cambridge, United Kingdom; http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), after which the sequences were trimmed, quality-filtered and dereplicated using the DADA2 algorithm (v1.14) within R107. An initial amplicon sequence variant (ASV) table was constructed before chimaeras were identified using the removeBimeraDenovo function. Finally, taxonomy was assigned using DADA2’s native naïve Bayesian classifier against the Silva database (v138)108.

As our sequencing samples are high bacterial biomass faecal samples, negative controls (buffer control) were included in our sequencing runs, to guard against reagent contamination, as this is only a problem in low bacterial biomass samples. We rarefied to 1300 reads per sample for 18S and 5047 ASVs for 16S and eliminated all sub-OTUs with fewer than 10 reads overall. 43 fecal samples from 37 individuals were used for subsequent diet statistic analysis and 41 fecal samples from 35 individuals were used for gut microbiome analysis. The mean abundance of 16S and 18S data of multiple samples from same individuals was calculated.

Sequence reads per fecal DNA sub-OTU found in the samples of each salamander were used as approximate proxy for ingested biomass. We calculated the prevalence of each prey taxon in the salamander diet, determined by the number of samples in which a prey category was found present or absent.

To measure the correlation between individual salamander diet and the fecal microbiome, Mantel tests were performed on the Jaccard and Bray–Curtis distance matrices using R. To further explore the inter-relationship between the diet and the bacterial community matrices, a co-inertia analysis was run using the ade4 package114 in R.
