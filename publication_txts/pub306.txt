Spinal Cord Injury Changes the Structure and Functional Potential of Gut Bacterial and Viral Communities



Emerging data indicate that gut dysbiosis contributes to many human diseases, including several comorbidities that develop after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). To date, all analyses of SCI-induced gut dysbiosis have used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. This technique has several limitations, including being susceptible to taxonomic “blind spots,” primer bias, and an inability to profile microbiota functions or identify viruses. Here, SCI-induced gut dysbiosis was assessed by applying genome- and gene-resolved metagenomic analysis of murine stool samples collected 21 days after an experimental SCI at the 4th thoracic spine (T4) or 10th thoracic spine (T10) spinal level. These distinct injuries partially (T10) or completely (T4) abolish sympathetic tone in the gut. Among bacteria, 105 medium- to high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered, with most (n = 96) representing new bacterial species. Read mapping revealed that after SCI, the relative abundance of beneficial commensals (Lactobacillus johnsonii and CAG-1031 spp.) decreased, while potentially pathogenic bacteria (Weissella cibaria, Lactococcus lactis_A, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron) increased. Functionally, microbial genes encoding proteins for tryptophan, vitamin B6, and folate biosynthesis, essential pathways for central nervous system function, were reduced after SCI. Among viruses, 1,028 mostly novel viral populations were recovered, expanding known murine gut viral species sequence space ∼3-fold compared to that of public databases. Phages of beneficial commensal hosts (CAG-1031, Lactobacillus, and Turicibacter) decreased, while phages of pathogenic hosts (Weissella, Lactococcus, and class Clostridia) increased after SCI. Although the microbiomes and viromes were changed in all SCI mice, some of these changes varied as a function of spinal injury level, implicating loss of sympathetic tone as a mechanism underlying gut dysbiosis.

IMPORTANCE To our knowledge, this is the first article to apply metagenomics to characterize changes in gut microbial population dynamics caused by a clinically relevant model of central nervous system (CNS) trauma. It also utilizes the most current approaches in genome-resolved metagenomics and viromics to maximize the biological inferences that can be made from these data. Overall, this article highlights the importance of autonomic nervous system regulation of a distal organ (gut) and its microbiome inhabitants after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). By providing information on taxonomy, function, and viruses, metagenomic data may better predict how SCI-induced gut dysbiosis influences systemic and neurological outcomes after SCI.

Gut microbiota protect mammals from pathogen colonization (reviewed in reference 1), regulate gut permeability (2), stimulate the immune system (reviewed in reference 1), synthesize essential vitamins (reviewed in reference 3), produce secondary bile acids (4, 5), produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and provide metabolic fuel for colonocytes by breaking down indigestible food sources (6, 7). Gut microbes are also key components of the “brain-gut axis,” i.e., the bidirectional system of communication between the central nervous system (CNS) and the digestive system. Gut microbes have been shown to be essential for normal CNS development, functioning, and recovery after injury (8,–11) and for regulating host neural activity and behavior in response to environmental cues (12). Indeed, gut-derived microbes produce various neuroactive metabolites or precursor molecules (e.g., tryptophan), which are needed to synthesize serotonin, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine, and melatonin (13). These neuroactive metabolites signal the CNS via vagal afferents, or they enter the circulation and pass directly into the neural parenchyma across the blood-brain barrier (14, 15). Gut microbes are also capable of indirectly signaling the CNS by influencing innate and adaptive immunity; and the immune system, like the gut, exerts bidirectional communication with the CNS (reviewed in reference 16).

All forms of SCI examined to date cause gut dysbiosis (19, 22,–27), but what remains unclear is whether SCI-induced changes in microbial population dynamics and the functional implications of those changes vary as a function of spinal injury level and/or injury severity. To expand upon current knowledge of SCI-induced gut dysbiosis, we use metagenomics to examine ecological and functional changes in gut bacterial and viral communities after SCI in a murine model, controlling for diet and antibiotic exposure (common confounders for microbiome studies) (22, 23, 57). Ecological and functional changes in the gut microbiota were compared in mice receiving SCI at the 4th thoracic spine (T4) or 10th thoracic spine (T10) spinal levels. We show that the severity of gut dysbiosis is affected by spinal injury level; more robust changes were noted when SCI occurred at high spinal levels (T4), which causes greater imbalance in autonomic tone in the gut. Our novel data also reveal SCI-dependent changes in the microbiome and virome, as well as related metabolic pathways, providing a myriad of new hypotheses to guide future SCI studies.

We hypothesized that sympathetic nervous system control over proximal and distal intestines will vary as a function of spinal injury level, causing differences in intestinal function that will directly affect the composition of the gut microbiome. The sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) controlling the small and large intestines are located primarily in the intermediolateral cell column in thoracic spinal segments T5 to T10 (58,–60). Therefore, most brain and brainstem control over spinal autonomic networks that innervate the gut are lost when SCI occurs at or above the T5 spinal level. When SCI occurs at lower spinal levels, some reflex control over spinal autonomic neurons remains intact, with the magnitude of intact circuitry varying as a function of injury level and severity. To date, there have been no controlled studies to assess how the gut microbiota responds to SCI when there is some or no preservation of executive control (from brain/brainstem) over spinal autonomic reflexes, although data from human subject research predicts that spinal-level-dependent differences do exist. Indeed, the composition of gut microbiota in individuals with cervical SCI was found to be distinct from that in people with thoracic or lumbar SCI (23). Here, to directly test the hypothesis that the composition and magnitude of change in SCI-induced gut dysbiosis varies as a function of spinal injury level, three groups of mice were prepared (n = 15 mice in total; n = 5/group). Sham-injured control mice underwent laminectomy surgery at vertebral level T4 without spinal cord injury (Lam controls). Mice in the remaining two groups received a severe crush injury of the spinal cord at either the T10 or T4 spinal level. Based on published data, these two distinct spinal injury levels either partially preserve (T10) or abolish (T4) sympathetic innervation of the gut (58,–61). Because gut microbes are transferable among species that share the same habitat, all mice were singly housed throughout the study, starting 2 weeks before SCI. At 21 days postinjury (dpi), fecal samples were collected and then individually prepared for microbiome analysis (Fig. 1A). The 21-dpi time period was chosen because published data indicate that gut dysbiosis fully develops at this time postinjury (19).

Collectively, the above data suggest that gut dysbiosis is a consistent phenomenon after SCI but that greater disruption of sympathetic control over the colon, such as after high-level (T4) SCI, may drive distinct changes in the gut microbiota.

The above read-based analyses rely upon mapping to single-copy marker genes. At the community level, read-based analysis provides information for any microbes that have reference genomes available, and so read-based analyses are best used for assessing diversity patterns. However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) provide population genomes for the specific variants occurring in these samples as well as lineage-specific pathway- and gene-level information that can then be used to develop novel hypotheses regarding the functional capabilities and ecological niches for these microbes. Therefore, to further assess changing taxonomic patterns and infer microbial functions, we assembled the shotgun sequence data from each sample and then binned contigs to create de novo draft microbial genomes, i.e., MAGs. MAGs enable robust, genome-informed taxonomic classification within a sample and rather than predicting function from slow-evolving taxonomic marker genes, MAGs provide maps of ecologically relevant functional potential for known taxa (69). Using this approach, we recovered 112 MAGs (>60% complete, <10% contamination), including 105 MAGs of medium (n = 35; >70% complete, <10% contamination) to high (n = 70; >90% complete, <5% contamination) quality (see Materials and Methods) that recruited, on average, 54.7% of the quality-controlled sequencing reads (Data Set S1, tab 3). Most (n = 96) of these 105 MAGs represent previously unknown bacterial species as assessed against the GTDB-Tk v0.1.3 (63), the largest curated genomic taxonomy database available (69) (see Materials and Methods; Data Set S1, tab 4). Across the data set, 25 MAGs were differentially abundant between the Lam and SCI groups (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P < 0.05, FDR < 0.05) (Fig. 3A; Fig. S3 and Data Set S1, tab 5).

Collectively, these data suggest that SCI decreases commensal abundances, which may open niches for antagonistic commensals and opportunistic pathogens that can increase inflammation and impair recovery after SCI. However, since most (>90%) of these MAGs represent novel species, the metagenomic approach provides an opportunity to establish baseline hypotheses beyond taxonomy about metabolic versatility—such as the vitamin B6, virulence factors, and LPS genes identified and described here—that could contribute to pathological comorbidities common in SCI individuals.

Beyond the MAG-constrained analyses, we next sought to more broadly evaluate functional changes in the microbiome, since functions often vary more than taxonomy, both in human (87) and environmental systems (88). Previous work using 16S sequencing to characterize gut dysbiosis in a rat model of cervical SCI predicted differences in microbial functions between healthy and SCI rats using the PICRUSt algorithm (27). Although tools (i.e., PICRUSt) to infer microbial function from taxonomic profiling can be useful, they do not always correlate with results obtained using metagenomic sequencing (89), and critically, where correlations fail, these are likely to be niche-defining, ecologically relevant genes whose evolutionary histories (i.e., gene flow) are out of sync with slowly evolving ribosomal genes (89). Here, we translated predicted genes from assembled contigs (>500 bp in size) into amino acid sequences and then “organized” sequences into protein clusters. This eliminates bias against analyzing only proteins of known function (see Materials and Methods). As observed before at the taxon level (Fig. 1B), principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) revealed significant clustering of samples from the same group (PERMANOVA, R = 0.4151, P ≤ 0.001) (Fig. 4A), with the largest separation occurring between the Lam and SCI groups. When the between-group Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of each SCI group (T4/T10) was compared with that of healthy controls (Lam), protein cluster changes were exacerbated in mice with high-level T4 SCI (Fig. 4B). Although several metabolic genes were differentially abundant between the T4 and T10 SCI groups (Fig. S4B and Data set S1, tabs 8 and 9), Shannon’s diversity index was not different between the SCI groups (Fig. S4A). These data indicate that SCI-induced disruption of gut microbial composition is accompanied by a corresponding change in microbial function and that these changes are exacerbated in mice with high-level T4 SCI.

Taken together, these functional data support the hypothesis that SCI-induced gut dysbiosis promotes an inflammatory environment in the gut which could adversely affect gut motility and epithelial barrier integrity. This, in turn, has the potential to enhance bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation, exacerbating neuroinflammation and impairing neurological recovery after SCI. Recovery from SCI may be impaired further due to a reduction in the production and release of precursors needed for neurotransmitter synthesis and also vitamins and cofactors needed for optimal neurological function and CNS repair.

Given the lack of marker genes for viruses (55), we used de novo assembly and population-based approaches to characterize the gut virome. These techniques are well established for characterizing viruses in the oceans and soils (53, 54, 113). In total, we recovered 2,675 viruses above 5 kb and 1,028 viral viruses above 10 kb from the bulk metagenomes. Specifically, population- or species-level taxa above 10 kb were discerned by clustering genomes at >95% average nucleotide identity genome-wide, and genus-level taxa were assigned using gene sharing networks. In total, this revealed 1,028 viral populations (approximately species-level taxonomy [54, 114, 115]; ≥10 kb) (see Materials and Methods), of which virtually all (n = 1,016; 98.8% of the 1,028) are novel species (Data Set S1, tab 12; see Materials and Methods). Indeed, exhaustive comparisons were made to public databases, including NCBI RefSeq v88 (4,061 complete genomes; >10 kb) (116) and the Human Gut Virome Database (6,360 viral populations; >10 kb) (34), or an additional 502 mouse gut virus genomes were curated (dereplicated into populations) from the IMG/VR database (117) and a published murine viral particle metagenome (118) (see Materials and Methods). Based on these comparisons, these murine gut viral species, which were previously unknown, expand the known murine gut viral sequence space ∼3-fold (Data Set S1, tab 13; see Materials and Methods).

Though the study of viruses in complex communities and viral ecogenomic approaches are in their infancy, particularly for inferring phage lifestyle (e.g., lytic or temperate), understanding phage-host dynamics is likely essential for us to reveal any causal roles played by the gut virome in disease (132). Lytic phages metabolically reprogram their bacterial hosts during infection in ways that alter that host’s output into the ecosystem (133) and ultimately kill their hosts to modulate host abundance and diversity through predator-prey dynamics (reviewed in reference 35). Temperate phages integrate themselves into host genomes and can regulate host gene function (reviewed in reference 134) and/or provide their hosts with new functions, like antibiotic resistance, toxin production, and other functions that may promote the virulence of commensals or confer fitness and competitive advantages to the hosts (123, 135). However, stressors, like antibiotics, hydrogen peroxide, and changes in nutrients and pH, which activate the bacterial host's SOS response, can induce temperate prophages, causing them to become lytic and ultimately kill host cells (123, 136, 137). Dietary fructose and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were shown to induce Lactobacillus reuteri temperate phages (138), and bile salts were shown to induce some Salmonella temperate phages (139). Gut inflammation can also increase temperate phage induction in mice (140). Thus, a change in gut phage ecology after SCI, due to actions by both temperate and lytic phages, could dramatically influence how individuals respond to dietary changes and repeated regimens of antibiotics or drug therapies. In turn, these changes could have significant implications for recovery of function and the development of various comorbidities after SCI.

The gut microbiome has emerged as an essential component of human development, metabolism, and health, and growing evidence from gene marker data for microbes (1,–4, 15) and metagenomic data for microbes and viruses (this study) suggest that this is also true for SCI. It is now clear that key probiotic bacterial populations and genes controlling their physiological functions are lost after SCI, suggesting that repopulating the gut with distinct bacterial taxa, such as Lactobacillus johnsonii and CAG-1031 spp., may help to improve a range of functional outcomes after SCI. Also, SCI-induced changes in the gut microbiota may be influenced by corresponding changes in the gut virome, a previously uncharacterized mechanism associated with gut dysbiosis after SCI. These novel phage-host interactions could influence clinical outcomes and also serve as therapeutic targets. For example, the century-old idea of “phage therapy,” whereby bacterial viruses (or phages) are used to selectively target host pathogens, could represent a novel approach to treat bacterial infections, thereby reducing the need for antibiotics (141), which are variably effective and also harm commensal bacteria. By leveraging the expanding array of microbiome capabilities and resources (142,–144) and the partnered viral ecogenomic toolkits for capture (145, 146) and characterization (52,–54), it is now possible to establish novel metagenome-enabled hypotheses regarding the effects of SCI on gut microbial ecology and how those changes can functionally influence mammalian physiology.

All surgical and postoperative care procedures were performed in accordance with the Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Fifteen female C57BL/6 mice from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine) were used in this study. To minimize external/environmental effects on the microbiota, we were meticulous in our efforts to establish controlled conditions, as follows. All animals were ordered together and arrived in the same cohort from Jackson Laboratories. To prevent gut microbial cross-contamination due to cohabitation, all mice were singly housed upon arrival at our animal facility and for the duration of the study in a vivarium room that contained no other animals. All mice remained in this same room for the duration of the study. No mice received antibiotics or dietary supplements at any point throughout the study. Quantity of food intake was not measured, but all mice received the same standard rodent chow for the duration of the study. Our data show that the effects of SCI are consistent (only one outlier was noted using multivariate statistics; see Fig. 1B as an example) and robust. Moreover, there are clear spinal level-dependent differences.

Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal cocktail of ketamine (80 mg/kg)-xylazine (10 mg/kg), after which a partial laminectomy was performed at the 4th thoracic spine (T4) or the 10th thoracic spine (T10). To create consistent severe SCI in each mouse, the spinal cord located between the T3 and T4 or T10 and T11 vertebrae was crushed by inserting modified no. 5 Dumont forceps (Fine Science Tools; with a tip of 0.4 to 0.2 mm) 2 mm ventrally into the vertebral column on both sides of the spinal cord and then laterally compressing the spinal cord by bringing the forceps tips together completely, so they are touching for 3 s. This lesion leaves the dura intact but creates a severe lesion with minimal sparing of ascending or descending axons in the white matter (147). Postoperatively, animals were hydrated with 2 ml Ringer’s solution (subcutaneous) for 5 days. Bladders were voided manually at least twice daily for the duration of the study. No prophylactic antibiotics were used during or after surgery. Fecal samples were collected 21 days postinjury (dpi). Mice were removed from their home cage and placed into a ventilated, aseptic polystyrene compartment, and fresh fecal samples were collected from each mouse into sterile tubes and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Mice were returned to their home cage after sample collection. In total, five mice received a complete crush at T4, five mice received a complete crush at T10, and five mice did not receive any crush after laminectomy (Lam group). In our previous work (19), we collected serial samples from the same Lam mice and showed that laminectomy alone (control for both anesthesia and surgery) did not cause differences in gut microbiota when analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Office of Responsible Research Practices at The Ohio State University approved all animal protocols. All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of The Ohio State University and are outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Institutes of Health.

Bulk DNA was recovered from the 15 fecal samples separately using a ZymoBIOMICS extraction kit. Metagenomic library preparation and shotgun sequencing were conducted at CosmosID using an IonTorrent Ion S5 next-generation sequencing system. On average, 23.5 million single-end reads were generated per sample (range, 15.2 million to 36.2 million reads), with an average read length of 180 bp. Reads were quality trimmed using bbduk (https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/) from both ends to remove bases with low-quality scores (qtrim = rl, trimq = 10) and positions with high compositional bias (ftl = 10, ftr = range from 204 to 229 depending on the sample). Reads shorter than 30 bp (minlength = 30), with Ns (maxns = 0) or with an average quality below 10 (maq = 10) were discarded. Mouse reads were removed from all the samples using bbmap (https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/) by mapping against the genome of our model mouse strain C57BL/6NJ (downloaded from the NCBI assembly database; GCA_001632555.1) and removing reads with a minimum identity of 95% (minid = 0.95). After quality control, all the clean single-end reads were cross-assembled using SPAdes (v3.11.1) (148) in the “read-error correction and assembling” mode and using the (-iontorrent) flag. The full k-mer size list (-k 21, 33, 55, 77, 99, 127) was used in the assembly. All bioinformatic analyses were performed within the Ohio Supercomputer Center (149). For a visual overview of the bioinformatic analyses, see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material.

Reads from each sample were piped through SingleM (singlem pipe; https://github.com/wwood/singlem) to estimate the abundance of discrete taxa down to the strain level (Sensu [150]). Relative abundances of taxa, which were used for all phylum- and genus-level comparisons, were calculated from the mean coverage of 14 single-copy marker genes to avoid copy number variations associated with 16S-based estimates of abundance and to increase taxonomic resolution. Abundances of taxa inferred from the coverage of ribosomal protein L2 (rplB), which is widely used for microbial community analysis (151), were used for principal-coordinate analysis of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. Within- and between-group Bray-Curtis dissimilarity analyses were performed using vegan in R. Principal-coordinate analysis (function capscale with no constraints applied) was carried out on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix (function vegdist; method “bray”) after a log2 transformation on the relative abundance matrix. A pseudo count of 1 was added to all the cells before this transformation to avoid negative numbers. The three groups that emerged in the ordination plot were tested using a PERMANOVA test (function “anosim”) and were defined on the plot using function “ordihull.” For a visual overview of the bioinformatic analyses, see Fig. S1B.

Microbial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered using the coassembly-optimized tool MaxBin 2.0 (v2.2.4) (152), which depends on the tetranucleotide frequencies of the contigs, a phylogenetic marker gene set, and differential coverage binning. First, all reads from each sample were mapped to the coassembled contigs using Bowtie2 (v2.3.4.1) (148). The number of mapped bases (for average coverage calculation) and reads (for calculation of normalized reads per kilobase per million mapped reads [RPKM]) were counted using BEDTools (v2.23.0) (153) in “mapbamsamples.pl” of SqueezeMeta (May 2018 distribution) (154). The MAGs were then binned by MaxBin 2.0 using each sample’s contigs’ coverage (-abund_list) and the full marker gene set. CheckM (v1.0.12) (155) was then used to assess the quality (completeness and contamination) of the genome bins using the “lineage_wf” pipeline, and genome bins were filtered at a completeness of ≥60% and a contamination of ≤10%. dRep (v2.2.3) (156) was used then to dereplicate the MAGs at 97% average nucleotide identity (dRep_97 -comp 60 -con 10 -sa 0.97). After the dereplication, 112 MAGs were recovered (>60% complete, <10% contamination), including 70 high-quality MAGs (>90% complete, <5% contamination) and 35 medium-quality MAGs (>70% complete, <10% contamination) that were recovered from our 15 samples. After the recovery of the MAGs, GTDB-Tk (v0.1.3) (63) was used to assign taxonomic classifications for the 112 MAGs in the “classify_wf” mode. In total, 9 MAGs can be confidently resolved into bacterial species. In addition, among the rest of the MAGs, 73 MAGs can be assigned to bacterial genera. The coverm (https://github.com/wwood/CoverM) was conducted for mapping the reads in different samples to the reference genome (MAGs) in “genome” mode and “single” parameter. Data Set S1 describes the characteristics of the dereplicated MAGs and the predicted taxon of each MAG. For a visual overview of the bioinformatic analyses, see Fig. S1B.

With a high sequencing depth (average of 23.5 million reads/sample compared to ∼5 to 10 million in more typical gut microbiomes [157]) in the bulk metagenomes, we were able to identify putative viral contigs, including a mix of actively infecting lytic viruses and prophages, from the bulk metagenomes following assembly. An ensemble approach was used where, first, all contigs were analyzed using VirSorter (v1.0.5) (158), DeepVirFinder (v1.0) (159), MARVEL (v0.1) (160), and CAT (https://github.com/dutilh/CAT). This approach combines homology-based identification (CAT and VirSorter), sequence composition in deep learning (DeepVirFinder), and genomic features in probabilistic models (VirSorter and MARVEL). VirSorter was used in the “bulk metagenome” mode and with selection of the virome database, while DeepVirFinder was allowed to predict contigs down to 300 bp in length. Next, linear contigs of ≥5 kb and circular contigs of  ≥1.5 kb that were sorted as VirSorter categories 1 to 6, by a DeepVirFinder score of  ≥0.7 (P value < 0.05), and/or by a MARVEL random forest probability of  ≥70% were kept for further investigation. Of these contigs, those that were sorted as VirSorter categories 1, 2, 4, and 5, by a DeepVirFinder score of  ≥0.9, or by a MARVEL probability of ≥90% were considered viral. For the rest of the kept contigs, they were considered viral only if they were identified by at least two tools, VirSorter (categories 3 or 6), DeepVirFinder (score of  ≥0.7 and <0.9), MARVEL (probability of ≥70% and <90%), and/or CAT (annotated as viral or <40% of the genes were classified nonviral). In total, 29,143 viral contigs were identified, with 2,675 viral contigs of ≥5 kb and 1,030 viral contigs of ≥10 kb. Then, the identified putative viral contigs were clustered into viral populations using Clustergenomes (v1.1.0; https://bitbucket.org/MAVERICLab/stampede-clustergenomes/src/master/) at ≥95% nucleotide identity across ≥80% of the shorter genome length (55). This resulted in 2,658 viral populations of ≥5 kb and 1,028 viral populations of ≥10 kb (see Data Set S1, tab 20, for VirSorter, Deep VirFinder, MARVEL, and CAT results). Notably, the number of viral populations of ≥5 kb recovered from the 15 samples in this study significantly exceeds the global average of 1,581 viral populations per study at the same contig length cutoff (34). Clustergenomes analysis was also conducted using a combination of our 1,028 viral populations with viral populations (>10 kb) in public databases, including NCBI RefSeq v88 (116), the Human Gut Virome Database (34), and the murine gut virome from the IMG/VR database (117), and one murine viral particle metagenome (118) to determine the novelty of our viral species. For a visual overview of the bioinformatic analyses, see Fig. S1C.

Viral genus-level taxonomy was assigned using vConTACT 2.0 (v2-0.9.9) (119) by clustering (–rel-mode BLASTP –pcs-mode MCL –vcs-mode ClusterONE) our 1,028 viral populations (>10 kb) with both the RefSeq viral genome database (v88) (4,061 complete genomes; >10 kb) (116) and the Human Gut Virome Database (6,360 viral populations; >10 kb) (34). The viral populations that can be clustered with a viral genome from RefSeq were likely to be assigned to a known viral taxonomic genus, family, or order classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) taxonomy. Data Set S1, tab 14, summarizes the viral clusters using vConTACT 2.0. Four different computational methods were used to predict putative hosts for the viral populations, prophage-BLAST, CRISPR spacer matches, tRNA exact matches, and k-mer-based sequence similarity. For prophage-BLAST, the viral genome nucleotide sequences were compared to the MAGs using BLASTn based on a method described previously (161). To improve prediction accuracy, only hits with 100% identity over 100% of the length of viral contigs were used for further prediction. Only prophage-BLAST predictions that can be identified using PHASTER (162) were considered. For CRISPR linkages, MinCED (v0.2.0; https://github.com/ctSkennerton/minced) was used to search for prokaryotic CRISPR spacers (with a minimum of 2 repeats that a CRISPR must contain) from our set of MAGs. Then, the prokaryotic CRISPR spacers were matched to viral contigs using BLASTn. Only hits with at least 95% identity over the whole spacer length were considered. For tRNA linkages, tRNAscan-SE (v1.23) (163) was conducted to identify tRNAs from viral contigs (using the general model -G) and MAGs (using the bacterial model -B). Then, tRNA secondary structure sequences from viral contigs were compared to those from MAGs using BLASTn. Only hits with 100% identity over 100% of the length, and at least one hit in each MAG that was consistent with prophage-BLAST prediction, were considered. For k-mer frequency linkages, host-virus connections were predicted using WIsH (v1.0) (129). To assign P values to individual virus-host predictions, we built a null model using all the sequences in the RefSeq viral genomes database. Only WIsH prediction with a P of 0 and the consistent predictions from both WIsH with a P of <0.05 and prophage-BLAST were considered. Figure S7 and Data Set S1, tab 18, show the results from viral host prediction using different methods.

We annotated genes on all of the assembled contigs by first predicting the open reading frames (ORFs) using Prodigal (v2.6.3) (164) in the metagenomic mode (-p) and ignoring any masked non-protein-coding sequences (-m) produced by “barrnap.pl” of SqueezeMeta. Next, the ORFs were annotated using a pipeline described previously (165). Briefly, annotations were conducted by running a combination of reciprocal best blast hit searches against the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) (166) and UniRef90 (167) databases in tandem with HMM searches against Pfams (168). About half of ORFs can be annotated using KEGG, and KEGG annotations were then used for downstream analyses. MMseqs2 (version 4eb5e14267f64f2fb337995bd824ef279e04f266) (169) was used for clustering of all the protein sequence (cluster –min-seq-id 0.3 –cov-mode 1 -c 0.7 -e 0.00001), and the abundances of all the proteins within each cluster were summed to represent the total abundance of each unique protein clusters (PCs). In total, 335,087 protein clusters were identified for PCoA analyses.

To infer phage lifestyle, prophage-bacterium junctions (attachment sites) (122) and lysogeny signatures were searched to identify candidate temperate phages. Candidate identifiable prophages were first identified with PHASTER (162), followed by manual inspection of the annotations for the presence of the attL and attR attachment sites (att). Then, lysogeny signatures (123,–126), including integrase(s)/site-specific recombinase, excisionase, phage repressor/antirepressor, and ParA/B genes, were searched by annotating genes of the 2,675 viral genomes (>5 kb) against the KEGG (166) and UniRef90 (167) databases in tandem with HMM searches against Pfams (168). A prophage usually inserts into the host genome by integrases, which mediate site-specific recombination between the phage attachment site (attP) and the bacterial attachment site (attB) (170, 171). This results in an inserted prophage flanked by two hybrid sites (attL and attR), also needed for the reverse reaction (excision of the phage from the chromosome) along with excisionases (170, 171). Thus, a viral contig can be considered a typical prophage region if it has an integrase HMM match and attachments sites (attL and attR). Figure S6A is a clear example of a “confident” temperate phage, with putative “att” sites next to an integrase gene in the noncoding region. A viral contig containing only lysogeny markers is considered a “candidate” temperate phage. Figure S6B and Data Set S1, tabs 16 and 17, summarize the results from PHASTER and lysogeny markers.

All the statistical analyses were conducted using RStudio. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was conducted using the function “wilcox.test” in R, and “pairwise.wilcox.test” with adjusted method “fdr” was used to calculate the false discovery rate (FDR). “edgeR” and “limma” in R were used for differential analysis for viral populations (>5 kb) in different treatments. The “ggplot2” R package was used for box plots and bar plots. The R package “VennDiagram” was used for Venn diagram plotting, and “pheatmap” was used for heat maps.
