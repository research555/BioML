The effects of the Green-Mediterranean diet on cardiometabolic health are linked to gut microbiome modifications: a randomized controlled trial

Previous studies have linked the Mediterranean diet (MED) with improved cardiometabolic health, showing preliminary evidence for a mediating role of the gut microbiome. We recently suggested the Green-Mediterranean (Green-MED) diet as an improved version of the healthy MED diet, with increased consumption of plant-based foods and reduced meat intake. Here, we investigated the effects of MED interventions on the gut microbiota and cardiometabolic markers, and the interplay between the two, during the initial weight loss phase of the DIRECT-PLUS trial.

In the DIRECT-PLUS study, 294 participants with abdominal obesity/dyslipidemia were prospectively randomized to one of three intervention groups: healthy dietary guidelines (standard science-based nutritional counseling), MED, and Green-MED. Both isocaloric MED and Green-MED groups were supplemented with 28g/day walnuts. The Green-MED group was further provided with daily polyphenol-rich green tea and Mankai aquatic plant (new plant introduced to a western population). Gut microbiota was profiled by 16S rRNA for all stool samples and shotgun sequencing for a select subset of samples.

Both MED diets induced substantial changes in the community structure of the gut microbiome, with the Green-MED diet leading to more prominent compositional changes, largely driven by the low abundant, “non-core,” microorganisms. The Green-MED diet was associated with specific microbial changes, including enrichments in the genus Prevotella and enzymatic functions involved in branched-chain amino acid degradation, and reductions in the genus Bifidobacterium and enzymatic functions responsible for branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. The MED and Green-MED diets were also associated with stepwise beneficial changes in body weight and cardiometabolic biomarkers, concomitantly with the increased plant intake and reduced meat intake.

Furthermore, while the level of adherence to the Green-MED diet and its specific green dietary components was associated with the magnitude of changes in microbiome composition, changes in gut microbial features appeared to mediate the association between adherence to the Green-MED and body weight and cardiometabolic risk reduction.

Our findings support a mediating role of the gut microbiome in the beneficial effects of the Green-MED diet enriched with Mankai and green tea on cardiometabolic risk factors.

The study was registered on ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT03020186) on January 13, 2017.

The Mediterranean (MED) diet, high in nuts, vegetables, and legumes and low in red meat intake, is recommended for the prevention of cardiometabolic diseases [1–3].

The previously reported DIRECT-PLUS dietary trial was a three-armed randomized trial including 294 subjects, with primary outcomes that included abdominal fat deposition and obesity [8, 9]. In the current analysis, predefined as a secondary outcome, we evaluated the effect of MED-based dietary interventions on the gut microbiome composition and function. We sought to identify specific microbial genera and metabolic pathways modified by the plant-enriched Green-MED diet while shedding light on the important role of the rare, “non-core” taxa as drivers of change in composition. Lastly, we aimed to determine the mediating role of the gut microbiome in the association between dietary adherence and the notable cardiometabolic risk reduction introduced by the Green-MED diet.

The DIRECT-PLUS (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT03020186) was a prospectively registered clinical trial carried out in the Nuclear Research Center Negev, Dimona, Israel, a facility with an in-house dining room and medical clinic. The first subject was enrolled on January 28, 2017, and the last subject was enrolled on April 30, 2017. The trial was initiated and conducted in a single phase between May 2017 and November 2018.

Inclusion criteria were age > 30 years with abdominal obesity [waist circumference (WC): men > 102 cm, women > 88 cm] or dyslipidemia [triglycerides (TG) > 150mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) ≤ 40 mg/dL for men, ≤ 50 mg/dL for women]. Exclusion criteria are detailed in Additional file 1: Methods. The study was approved by the Soroka University Medical Centre Institutional Review Board. Participants provided written informed consent and received no compensation.

Design and intervention of the DIRECT-PLUS, as well as primary outcomes of the trial (defined as abdominal fat tissues, body weight, and waist circumference), were previously reported in detail [8, 9]. This report is focused on the analysis of the trials’ secondary outcomes, including gut microbiome profile, lipid profile, glycemic control, inflammatory state, and cardiometabolic risk.

Measurements and sample collection were obtained at baseline and 6 months. Participants were weighed without shoes to the nearest 0.1 kg. Waist circumference was measured halfway between the last rib and the iliac crest to the nearest millimeter.

Fecal samples were collected at the study site, immediately frozen to –20°C for 1–3 days, then transferred to –80°C pending DNA extraction. Participants prescribed antibiotic therapy 2 months prior to the delivery of baseline fecal samples were excluded from all microbiome analyses. All blood biochemical assays were performed at the University of Leipzig, Germany. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed at Fondazione Edmund Mach, Italy. Fecal metagenomic sequencing was performed at CoreBiome, MN, USA.

To characterize the microbiome composition and to assess taxon abundance, fecal DNA from 546 fecal samples was extracted and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed by targeting the V3–V4 variable region of approximately 460-bp length using the bacterial primer pair 341F (5′ CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG 3′) and 806R (5′ GACTACNVGGGTWTCTAATCC 3′). Paired-end sequencing reads were quality filtered, trimmed, de-noised, and merged using the DADA2 software version 1.14.0 [22]. To reject low-quality bases, forward reads were truncated to 280 bases and 25 bases were cropped from start. Reverse reads were truncated to 220 bases and 14 bases were cropped from start. Reads with a number of expected errors higher than two were discarded. Taxonomy was assigned to all identified amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) based on the SILVA rRNA reference database version 132 [23].

To characterize the microbiome’s functional capacity, a subset of 173 samples (31% of samples) underwent shotgun metagenomics. Samples were collected from 90 participants as part of the pre-transplantation sampling of the DIRECT-PLUS autologous fecal microbiota transplantation study [13], with 31 samples from the HDG group, 69 from the MED group, and 73 from the Green-MED group. DNA was extracted, sequenced, and normalized with an average depth of 15.4±2.6 million reads per sample (mean±standard deviation). DNA sequences were aligned using an accelerated version of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to a curated database containing all representative genomes in RefSeq v86 [24]. Each input sequence was assigned the lowest common ancestor that was consistent across at least 80% of all reference sequences tied for best hit. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology groups were observed directly using alignment against a gene database derived from the strain database used above. Further details regarding DNA extraction and bioinformatics pipelines can be found in Additional file 1: Methods.

Assessment of nutritional intake and lifestyle habits was performed using self-reported food frequency questionnaires administered through a computer at baseline and after 6 months [25, 26]. Frequencies and portions of each individual food item were converted to average daily intake for each participant at each time point. Average daily energy intake was calculated by multiplying the frequency of consumption of each item by its caloric content and summing across all foods.

We then applied a Green-MED adherence score to measure the degree of adherence to the Green-MED pattern. The adherence score was created based on the MED index by Willett et al. [27] and Trichopoulou et al. [28] and modified to suit the Green-MED intervention. The adherence score was based on the intake of 9 items: walnuts, vegetables, processed meat, red meat, legumes, fruits, fish, green tea, and Mankai. Each component’s daily intake was normalized to the average daily intake (component intake in grams/total calories). For beneficial components (vegetables, legumes, fruit, walnuts, fish, green tea, and Mankai), individuals whose consumption was below the median were assigned a value of 0, and those whose consumption was at or above the median were assigned a value of 1. For red/processed meat intake, participants whose consumption was below the median were assigned a value of 1, and those at or above the median were assigned a value of 0. The final Green-MED score ranged from 0 (minimal adherence) to 9 (perfect adherence).

All statistical analyses were performed in R v3.5.0. To assess the effect of dietary intervention on the composition of microbial communities, we applied permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) on dissimilarity matrices of weighted UniFrac, using the adonis function from the R package vegan with 999 permutations [29]. To further evaluate the intervention effect on the microbiome composition over time, a PERMANOVA model was applied with the interaction term of lifestyle intervention and group as independent variables (group X time), both for all groups together and for all three combinations of group pairs in a leave-one-out manner.

We next used the high-dimensional mediation analysis suggested by Zhang et al. [34], using the HIMA package in R [34], using the same dependent/independent variables, with the change of addressing the high-dimensional nature of the microbiome data, and identifying changes in specific taxa as mediators. In the per-feature tests, unless otherwise noted, all the P values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. All multiple hypothesis testing was controlled for false discovery rate with a target of q < 0.25.

Two hundred ninety-four subjects were recruited in the DIRECT-PLUS weight-loss trial [8, 9] and randomized to one of the three lifestyle intervention groups.

Of those, 97% (n = 286) provided a fecal sample at baseline and were included in the current analyses. We measured body weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure and collected fasting blood samples, stool samples, and dietary data at baseline and month 6. Of the 546 stool samples profiled by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 173 were further profiled by shotgun metagenomic sequencing [13]. The mean age at baseline was 51 years; 88% were male, with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 31 kg/m2. Follow-up stool samples were obtained from 91% of the recruited participants. See Additional file 3: Table S2 for group characteristics, Fig.
1A for the study design, Additional file 4: Fig. S1 for the flow chart, and Additional file 4: Fig. S2 for patterns of gut microbial taxonomic variation of the cohort.

Following 6 months of dieting, all three groups had undergone a significant change in microbiome composition, as assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing, though it appeared that the Green-MED dieters exhibited the most prominent change, with a significant interaction between time (baseline to six months) and group (P of interaction = 0.01) as revealed by principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on weighted UniFrac distances. To compare the compositional change between groups in a subject-specific manner, we created a log2 change ASV matrix between the two timepoints of each subject. The Green-MED group differed significantly in its change compared to the other two groups (PGreen-MED vs HDG = 0.001, PGreen-MED vs MED = 0.04), whereas no significant difference was observed between the MED and HDG groups (PMED vs HDG = 0.19; Fig.
1B and Additional file 4: Fig. S3). We next evaluated the effect of diet on change at the genus level of bacteria and KEGG pathway modules. At month 6, different dietary interventions led to distinct changes across different phyla and functional groups (Fig.
1C, D).

In light of evidence linking the rare, person-specific, fraction of taxa in the microbiome profile, with sensitivity to dietary alterations [35], we next stratified the taxonomic features, as assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing, into “core” (ASVs > 50% prevalence) and “non-core” categories (ASVs < 50% prevalence). We found that the changes in taxonomy induced by the Green-MED were largely driven by the non-core features (Fig.
2A, B).

We next asked the question whether the dietary regimens modified the composition of the microbiome in a converging manner, i.e., whether changes in the microbiome compositions of participants resulted in the subject’s gut microbiomes being more similar to each other during the intervention, and to what extent the converging effect was affected by the dietary regimen. Comparing within-group and between-group dissimilarities to a null model, we observed that the Green-MED dieters’ microbiome composition became more similar following the diet, as compared to the HDG and MED groups. Furthermore, performing the same comparison only on the non-core taxonomic features, it could be observed that convergence was more dominant in the non-core microbiome (Fig.
2C).

We conducted per-feature testing by using MaAsLin2 linear mixed models [31] to identify microbial genera (by 16S rRNA) and KEGG modules (by shotgun metagenomics) that were differentially changed by diet from baseline to month 6. We found that 21 genera responded to the dietary intervention differentially across groups (q of interaction < 0.25; Fig.
3A), including a stepwise increase in Prevotella across the three dietary groups, suggesting an effect induced by the graded dietary modifications across groups (Kendall tau; P = 0.02), and a stepwise decrease in Bifidobacterium across the groups (Kendall tau; P < 0.001). These observations are in accordance with previous reports that linked vegetable-based diets [4] and adherence to a MED diet with increased Prevotella abundance [5] and linked greater weight loss [36] and a dietary pattern with improved glycemic index to lower abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. [37].

Comparing changes in microbial metabolic pathways (KEGG modules) that utilize dietary components (i.e., carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid metabolism), we found a stepwise increase in BCAA degrading pathways (isoleucine degradation, Kendall tau; P = 0.02) and a decrease in pathways of BCAA biosynthesis (valine and isoleucine biosynthesis, Kendall tau; P < 0.05) comparing MED diet groups to the HDG group. MED diet interventions also led to an enrichment in lipid metabolizing pathways, possibly due to the increased lipid intake and decreased carbohydrate intake commensurate with MED diets (Fig.
3C, D).

To examine the effects of plant-enriched and meat-depleted diets on cardiometabolic markers, we evaluated the 6-month change in a graded manner across the dietary groups. Among 47 blood biomarkers and anthropometric measurements, significant effects of the dietary intervention were found in 21 (Kendall tau, FDR-corrected q < 0.25). As we recently reported, the Green-MED diet led to the greatest body-weight reduction (−6.5%), followed by MED (−5.4%) and the HDG group (−1.58%, q < 0.001) [8]. Similar cross-group trends were observed in the reduction of Framingham risk score, waist circumference, mean arterial pressure, and homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (Fig.
4), along with diet-related markers of iron, vitamin D3, and folic acid, the latter being of interest as an established biomarker of green leaf consumption [38].

Evaluating the association between changes in biomarkers and shifts in microbiome composition (assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing), body-weight change explained the highest proportion of variation (0.9%). Significant associations with compositional changes were observed in the change in several biomarkers, including plasma leptin (0.7%), waist circumference (0.66%), systolic blood pressure (0.5%), HOMA-IR (0.5%), and Framingham risk score (0.65%, Fig.
4).

In order to assess the interplay between adherence to the Green-MED diet, gut microbial changes, and cardiometabolic effects, we devised a 9-dimensional adherence score (the “Methods” section), modified from the original Mediterranean index [27, 39, 40], with the addition of green components (green tea and Mankai) and the reductions in both red and processed meat intake. The green-MED score ranged from 0 (non-adherence) to 9 (full adherence, Fig.
5A) and was standardized based on caloric intake. As expected, the Green-MED dieters had higher adherence to green tea and Mankai intake and reduced intake of processed meat. Both MED groups adhered to increased intake of vegetables, legumes, and walnuts. Overall, the Green-MED score had a significant positive increment across dietary groups (MED vs. HDG P = 0.03, Green-MED vs. HDG P < 0.001; Kendall tau, P < 0.001; Fig.
5A). Furthermore, the Green-MED score was significantly associated with gut microbiome compositional changes (16S rRNA PERMANOVA, 0.8% explained variance, P = 0.006).

As we hypothesized that the dietary interventions, through modulation of the gut microbiome, exert their effects on cardiometabolic risk, we next sought to quantify the mediation effect. To this aim, we estimated the causal mediation effect as proposed by Imai et al. [32], using the first principal component of variation of the ASV change matrix as a summary measure of the gut microbiome composition. The association between the Green-MED diet adherence and weight loss (12% mediation by taxonomic change), WC loss (10%), and FRS reduction (18%) was found to be mediated by the change in the gut microbial composition. When assessing the mediatory effect specific to the change of Green-MED-associated genera, Chemerin change was also found to be significantly mediated (Fig.
5B, D). In order to assess the mediatory effect of specific bacteria, we applied a high-dimensional mediation analysis [34]. Among the significant mediatory taxa, Bifidobacterium change was found to mediate the Green-MED effect on weight loss (4%) and Ruminococcaceae UCG10 mediated the effect on FRS reduction (1.3%). Changes in the cysteine biosynthesis pathway were a prominent mediator of weight loss (14.2%) and FRS reduction (29.3%).

In the current study, we demonstrate the effect of MED and Green-MED diets on the gut microbiome and determine the mediatory role of the microbiome in the associations between adherence to the Green-MED diet and subsequent improvement in markers of cardiometabolic risk. We showed that the Green-MED diet induced a prominent change in the gut microbiome composition, driven by the low-prevalent “non-core” fraction of the gut microbiome. This change was convergent by nature, with the taxonomic composition of the microbiome of individuals in the Green-MED becoming more similar to each other. The different diets were also characterized by distinct taxonomic and functional changes, inducing a gradual increase in the abundance of Prevotella and BCAA degradation pathway concomitant with the increment of plant components in MED diets, and reductions in the abundance of Bifidobacterium and BCAA biosynthesis pathways when comparing MED diets vs. the control diet. The MED and Green-MED diets improved cardiometabolic markers, including the Framingham risk score, body weight, blood pressure, HOMA-IR, and fasting plasma leptin. These beneficial changes in levels of cardiometabolic biomarkers were associated with a concurrent shift in the gut microbiome composition, estimated to mediate 12% of body-weight reduction and 18% of Framingham risk score reduction.

The associations between dietary patterns, the gut microbiome, and cardiometabolic health have been extensively evaluated in recent years [37, 60, 61], with several studies exploring microbial modifications related to beneficial diets, including the MED diet [4, 5, 48]. Our study links MED diets with several taxa, including the depletion of Blautia [48] and enrichment of Bacteroides [48], adding to the body of evidence by examining the effect of expanding the plant fraction of the diet while minimizing meat intake. We showed that overall, the gut microbiome contributes a small but significant mediatory effect in the association between MED diets and weight and cardiometabolic risk reduction.

MED diet enriched in plant components and with decreased red and processed meat consumption (Green-MED diet) has extensive effects on the composition and function of the host gut microbiome, with the latter partially mediating the beneficial effects of the diet on cardiometabolic health. In future studies, the diet-microbiome-host interplay should be further explored and could guide novel beneficial modifications in known dietary patterns.
