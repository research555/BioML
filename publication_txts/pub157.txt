Emerging trends and research foci in gastrointestinal microbiome



Gastrointestinal microbiome has drawn an increasing amount of attention over the past decades. There is emerging evidence that the gut flora plays a major role in the pathogenesis of certain diseases. We aimed to analyze the evolution of gastrointestinal microbiome research and evaluate publications qualitatively and quantitatively.

We obtained a record of 2891 manuscripts published between 1998 and 2018 from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) of Thomson Reuters; this record was obtained on June 23, 2018. The WoSCC is the most frequently used source of scientific information. We used the term “Gastrointestinal Microbiomes” and all of its hyponyms to retrieve the record, and restricted the subjects to gastroenterology and hepatology. We then derived a clustered network from 70,169 references that were cited by the 2891 manuscripts, and identified 676 top co-cited articles. Next, we used the bibliometric method, CiteSpace V, and VOSviewer 1.6.8 to identify top authors, journals, institutions, countries, keywords, co-cited articles, and trends.

We identified that the number of publications on gastrointestinal microbiome is increasing over time. 112 journals published articles on gastrointestinal microbiome. The United States of America was the leading country for publications, and the leading institution was the University of North Carolina. Co-cited reference analysis revealed the top landmark articles in the field. Gut microbiota, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), probiotics, irritable bowel disease, and obesity are some of the high frequency keywords in co-occurrence cluster analysis and co-cited reference cluster analysis; indicating gut microbiota and related digestive diseases remain the hotspots in gut microbiome research. Burst detection analysis of top keywords showed that bile acid, obesity, and Akkermansia muciniphila were the new research foci.

This study revealed that our understanding of the link between gastrointestinal microbiome and associated diseases has evolved dramatically over time. The emerging new therapeutic targets in gut microbiota would be the foci of future research.

The human gastrointestinal flora is an essential organ that plays an important role in gastrointestinal and overall health. Understanding of this organ has evolved significantly over the past decades due to the large quantity of impactful research on the gastrointestinal microbiome.

CiteSpace is an application designed to generate and analyze networks of co-cited references based on bibliographic database [16]. We employed this method to analyze trends and hotspots of global publications on gastrointestinal microbiome between 1998 and 2018.

We obtained a record of 2891 manuscripts published between 1998 and 2018 from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) of Thomson Reuters; this record was obtained on June 23, 2018. The WoSCC is the most frequently used source of scientific information. We used the term “Gastrointestinal Microbiomes” and all of its hyponyms to retrieve the record, and restricted the subjects to gastroenterology and hepatology. We then derived a clustered network from 70,169 references that were cited by the 2891 manuscripts, and identified 676 top co-cited articles. Next, we used the bibliometric method, CiteSpace V, and VOSviewer 1.6.8 to identify top authors, journals, institutions, countries, keywords, co-cited articles, and trends.

Between 1998 and 2018, 2891 original research articles were published. There was an increasing trend for quantity of research publications on gastrointestinal microbiome (Fig. 1). The number of published articles on gastrointestinal microbiome steadily increased from 1998 through 2009, and then the number of publications significantly increased from 2010 onwards, with the number of publications almost doubled in 2014 compared to 2010. During 2016 through 2017, the activity in gut microbiome research reached a peak.

The total number of journals that published the 2891 articles on gastrointestinal microbiome was 112. The characteristics of the 10 most active journals and the main ideas of their representative articles are shown in Table 1 [1, 17–25]. All the publishers of the journals are located in either the United States of America or the United Kingdom. Digestive Diseases and Sciences published the greatest number of articles on gut microbiome, followed by World Journal of Gastroenterology and Gut. Regarding impact factor, Gastroenterology has the highest impact factor, followed by Gut and Alimentary Pharmacology Therapeutics.

The 2891 articles on gastrointestinal microbiome research were published by research groups in 41 countries/regions. The top 10 countries (6 European countries, 2 Asian countries, and 2 North American countries) published 2692 articles, accounting for 93.12% of the total number of publications. The leading country was the United States, which took up 31.92% (923/2891) of the total, the next 2 high production countries were Italy and the People’s Republic of China, which took up 10% and 8% of the total, respectively. There were more than 370 research institutions that published articles related to gut microbiome. The leading research institution with the highest number of publications was the University of North Carolina, which had 64 articles with the strongest citation burst from 2003 to 2011, followed by Harvard University (53 articles), Mayo Clinic (41 articles), French National Institute for Agricultural Research (40 articles), and Massachusetts General Hospital (39 articles).

VOSviewer keyword analysis of the 2891 articles identified 274 keywords with a minimum of 20 occurrences and divided them into 5 clusters (Gut microbiota, IBD, probiotics, double-blind, and irritable bowel syndrome) (Fig. 2).

The clustered network is derived from 70,169 references (including duplicates) that were cited by the 2891 articles. The clustered network of gastrointestinal microbiome is demonstrated in this part. Citation reference knowledge maps consist of references with higher centrality and citation counts. Visualization of co-cited articles showed a total of 676 nodes and 1427 links (Fig. 3a). Each node represents a cited article. The area of each node is proportional to the total co-citation frequency of the associated article.

The top 10 co-cited articles, their cited frequency, and cited half-year life are shown in Table 2. Sokol [12] in PNAS had the highest number of citations (168 citations), followed by Caporaso [17] in Nature Methods (163 citations), and Qin [4] in Nature (148 citations). These articles are often considered fundamental in gastrointestinal microbiome research.

To detect research hotspots, we mapped the 676 top co-cited articles cited by 2891 original articles via a clustered network in hierarchical order (Fig. 3b). The nodes represent different cited references and the clusters represent a distinct specialty or a thematic concentration. The citation reference knowledge map consists of references with higher centrality and citation counts. The area of each node is proportional to the total co-citation frequency of the associated reference. The co-cited references could be clustered into eleven main sub-clusters including obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, IBD, innate immunity, probiotics, etc. Figure 4 displays a timeline visualization of distinct co-citation and shows that Cluster #0 obesity and Cluster #2 Faecalibacterium prausnitzii had the highest concentration of nodes with citation bursts, and research foci seems to have shifted from IBD to obesity and cirrhosis. This supports the finding of the emerging focus in gut microbiome.

Burst detection identified articles that have attracted the attention of peer researchers. We detected bursts between 1998 through 2018 based on analysis of the 2891 original articles. The timeline is depicted as a blue line, and the time interval that a subject was found to have a burst is shown as a red segment on the blue timeline, indicating the beginning year, the ending year, and the duration of the burst. Among the top 191 keywords with the highest burst strength, we were particularly interested in those keywords with research significance which indicate the evolution trend of the gut microbiome (Fig. 5). During the entire time period from 1998 through 2018, dysbiosis had the highest burst strength, followed by Clostridium difficile infection, 16s rRNA, Interleukin 10 deficient mice, and fecal microbiota transplantation. Interleukin 10 deficient mice, bacterial translocation and overgrowth, and mesenteric lymph node became the research foci since 1998 and then the intestinal epithelial cell; 16s rRNA sequencing became a research focus since 2004, followed by toll like receptor and innate immunity, marking microbiome research entering the new era; regarding the bursts with most recent onset: bile acid, obesity, and Akkermansia muciniphila were the strongest bursts that started in 2016.

In this study, we utilized information visualization to analyze original articles on gut microbiome published from 1998 through 2018. Based on the trends we identified that showed an increasing number of scientific research publications over the 20-year period; we conclude that gut microbiome has become a subject of growing study and an increasingly important area of research. The burst of research activity after 2010 is likely due to the fact that some research publications that have had a major impact on the understanding of gut microbiome diversity and enterotype, sequencing data analysis in microbial communities, and related digestive diseases especially IBD, and obesity were published during 2005 and 2010 (Table 2); thus, triggering researchers’ attention in this field and causing an increased number of publications.

Compared to traditional reviews, analysis based on Citespace provides a better insight of the evolving research foci and trends, but it comes with certain limitations. Similar words need be merged together during the analysis; even though only original articles were included in the majority of analysis, all article types were included during the co-cited reference analysis.

There is no doubt that our understanding of gut microbiome has significantly advanced via bursts of high quality research occurring over the past 20 years. With the help of information visualization, we were able to identify research foci and overall trends in the field and offer gathered information to future researchers. We believe gut microbiota is associated with the pathogenesis of significantly more diseases than we currently know of. The emerging new therapeutic targets in gut microbiota would be the foci of future research.
