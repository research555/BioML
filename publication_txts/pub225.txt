Faecal microbiome and metabolic signatures in rectal neuroendocrine tumors

Background: The prevalence of rectal neuroendocrine tumors (RNET) has increased substantially over the past decades. Little is known on mechanistic alteration in the pathogenesis of such disease. We postulate that perturbations of human gut microbiome-metabolome interface influentially affect the development of RNET. The study aims to characterize the composition and function of faecal microbiome and metabolites in RNET individuals.

Conclusions: Our current study is the first to comprehensively characterize the perturbed interface of gut microbiome and metabolites in RNET patients, which may provide promising targets for microbiome-based diagnostics and therapies for this disorder.

Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-MENs) refer to a relatively rare but clinically important aggregation of malignancies, accounting for ≤ 1% of all neoplasms 1-3. As the second most common digestive cancer in terms of prevalence, GEP-MENs are defined as deprivation of normal epithelial tubular gland architectures and the expression of neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin A (CgA) or synaptophysin (SYN) 4. WHO classification system, mainly based on the proliferative index, subdivided these malignancies into well differentiated MENs (Neuroendocrine tumors, NETs; grade (G) 1, Ki-67 index ≤ 2%; or G2, Ki-67 index 3 - 20%), and poorly differentiated MENs (Neuroendocrine carcinomas, NECs; G3, Ki-67 index ≥ 20%) 3-5. Most recent evidence confirmed repeatedly that the annual incidence rate of GEP-MENs was continuously increased over the past three decades 1, probably due to the widespread use of screening colonoscopy, presenting great challenges for clinical management.

Dysbiosis of gut microbiome and metabolites has been widely studied in various types of digestive tract diseases, however, to date, partly due to the relatively low number of patients, we still know little about how specific bacterium and metabolites shape the colorectal environment, thus, to cause, sustain, mitigate, or predict the rectal diseases such as rectal neuroendocrine tumors (RNET). To address whether gut microbiota and metabolites contribute to the pathogenesis of RNET, our current study performed deep shotgun metagenomics and untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomic profiling on 92 stool samples from two cohort, the 58-case discovery cohort (40 healthy controls, 18 RNET patients) and the 34-case validation cohort (19 healthy controls, 15 RNET patients), aiming at characterizing the composition and function of faecal microbial community and metabolites from patients diagnosed as RNET. With these unbiased approaches, for the first time, we presented comprehensive characterization regarding specific microbiome and metabolites in RNET patients, with the intention of yielding further insights into the details of RNET pathogenesis and the implication of disease-related microbial dysbiosis.

See details in the supplementary experimental procedures.

In total, 58 eligible cases in the discovery cohort including 18 treatment-naïve patients diagnosed as RNET and 40 healthy individuals were included in this study. Clinical characteristics for each subject were provided in Table S1 and Figure S1A. Smoking and alcohol consumption history differed between groups without significance (Figure S1B, Brinkman index, p = 0.75; Alcohol, p = 0.089, two-tailed wilcoxon rank-sum test). RNET patients in our cohort tended to have higher age and BMI index, although we didn't find statistical significance regarding these clinical parameters between RNET and healthy individuals (Figure S1B, Age, p = 0.12; BMI, p = 0.36; two-tailed wilcoxon rank-sum test).

To comprehensively characterize the gut microbiome and metabolic features in RNET patients, we carried out highthroughput shotgun metagenomic sequencing on 58 faecal samples to profile their microbial community taxonomic composition. Then, each sample was further explored by LC-MS metabolomics in non-targeted modes, in order to capture a mass of established and uncharacterized metabolites (Figure
1A). Metagenomic and metabolomic data were analyzed for: 1) disease specific alteration in individual's microbial and metabolic features; 2) association between disease abundant microbiota and metabolites; 3) potential value of these features in RNET diagnosis. Specific features discovered in this cohort were then validated against an independent cohort of 15 RNET patients without receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 19 healthy controls.

Metagenomic sequencing was performed and generated an average of 71.36 million clean reads (11 Gb of data) per faecal sample on an NovaSeq 6000 platform. High-quality reads were then aligned to the updated gut microbiome gene catalog, representing the microbiome of the discovery cohort. To assess the difference of bacterial diversity between groups, we aligned sequences for gene count and α-diversity. The Integrated Gene Catalog (IGC) (Figure
1B) and Metagenomic phylogenetic analysis (MetaPhlAn2) (Figure
1C) results didn't show statistical significance between groups, although consistent reduction of community richness and Shannon index were observed in RNET patients compared with their control counterparts (IGC: Community richness, p = 0.65, Shannon index, p = 0.71; MetaPhlAn2: Community richness, p = 0.42, Shannon index, p = 0.41; two-tailed wilcoxon rank-sum test), which is indicative of delicate alterations of gut bacterial composition in RNET individuals. Next, by performing analysis including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Principal Coordinates analysis (PCoA) and Nonmetric MultiDimensional Scaling (NMDS), we evaluated the overall gut microbial structure in RNET patients at the phylum, genus, and species levels, respectively. Similarly, we didn't find distinct separation of microbiome composition at these levels (Figure S2, Table S2). Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) with Bray-Curtis distance also showed marginal difference between these two groups at the three dimensions (Figure S2). Ordination of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity by PCoA analysis at the species level was presented in Figure
1D (Adonis: R2 = 0.02, p = 0.389). As BMI, smoking and alcohol history have been implicated as potential risk factors for MENs 19, we next adjusted bacterial diversity for these parameters using multivariate association with linear models (MaAsLin2) method (Table S3-5). Here we found that bacterial α and β-diversity were not significantly influenced by gender, age, BMI, smoking and alcohol history. Thus, our findings collectively indicate mild shift of gut microbiome structure in patients with RNET.

To further dissect the taxonomic profiling of individual's gut microbiome differentially abundant in RNET, MetaPhlAn2 annotation was run to assess the microbial abundance at the species level. In total, 641 microbial species representing 217 genera were profiled in 58 faecal samples (Figure S3), 24 of which differed significantly between RNET and control groups (Figure
2A). Notably, we observed a remarkable depletion of microbial species in RNET as compared with controls, which was consistent with the general trend towards loss of species diversity in several digestive diseases' microbiome 16. Bacterium such as Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Veillonella unclassified, and Streptococcus salivarius were significantly abundant in the healthy group. Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus salivarius were commensal bacterium colonized in upper respiratory tract and gut, with the latter being a probiotic strain closely related with low occurrence of colorectal cancer 20, 21. In contrast, species, primarily composed of Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium_6_1_45, Varibaculum cambriense and Methanobrevibacter smithii exhibited the strongest enrichments in RNET subjects. Varibaculum cambriense is a medically related species involved in abscess formation 22, while overgrowth of Methanobrevibacter smithii was highly correlated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 23-25. Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium_6_1_45 belongs to the Erysipelotrichaceae family. Changes in the abundance level of such microorganism was observed in a spectrum of gastrointestinal diseases, including colorectal cancer, IBD, and TNF-driven Crohn's disease (CD) 26. Interestingly, previous studies strongly supported the close relation of these bacteria with metabolic disorders such as obesity. Highly abundant Erysipelotrichaceae was identified in obese individuals and in mice fed with high-fat diet 27, whereas germ-free mice colonized with Methanobrevibacter smithii showed enhanced degradation of dietary fructans, thereby promoting energy harvest and lipid storage 28. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) approach was further applied and identified 23 species that discriminately enriched in RNET or control groups (LEfSe: LDA > 2.0, p < 0.05). All these species were overlapped using the two methods (Figure S4A).

Microbial co-occurrence and co-excluding networks at the genus and species levels were constructed based on the Sparse Correlations using FastSpar 29. In contrast with healthy group, patients with RNET harbored a decreased complexity of network with lower connectivity. In the species network, we observed higher numbers of edge in control individuals (co-occurrence, 26; co-excluding, 17) compared with RNET patients (co-occurrence, 11; co-excluding, 5) (Figure
2B). In control subjects, RNET-enriched species, including Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium_6_1_45, Varibaculum cambriense and Methanobrevibacter smithii, showed the closest connectivity (roh > 0.6), which didn't recur in RNET group. Haemophilus paraphrohaemolyticus in healthy individuals contributed to most connection, including co-occurred with 4 species (Neisseria subflava, roh = 0.3106, p = 0.025; Rothia aeria, roh = 0.2768, p = 0.047; Haemophilus sputorum, roh = 0.3938, p = 0.01; Actinobacillus unclassified, roh = 0.5987, p = 0.001) and co-excluded with other 4 bacterium (Atopobium parvulum, roh = -0.3239, p = 0.02; Granulicatella unclassified, roh = -0.3506, p = 0.03; Streptococcus salivarius, roh = -0.3346, p = 0.024; Veillonella unclassified, roh = -0.3657, p = 0.024), highlighting its importance as a network-hub in control participants. By contrast, species network showed a less complexity in patients with RNET, implying the attenuated connection among these microorganisms, which may be due to the depleted microbial species in this group. Similar findings were found in the genus network (Figure S4B). We observed relatively higher connection among genera in control group as compared with RNET individuals.

Next, we characterized the species-level functional outcomes of microbial changes in RNET through annotation of KEGG modules based on our in-house and the Human Project Unified Metabolic Analysis Network 2 (HUMAnN2) pipelines 30, aiming at providing a more comprehensive and accurate profiling of the molecular activities of microbial communities at the pathway perspective. In total, 69 KEGG modules (based on our in-house pipeline) and 38 KEGG modules (based on the HUMAnN2 pipeline) were differentially abundant between RNET and control groups (LEfSe: p < 0.05, LDA > 2.0), 11 of which overlapped using these two methods (Figure
3A, Figure S5). Probably due to the depleted microbial community, we only identified 3 KEGG modules enriched in RNET samples based on the HUMAnN2 pipeline, including M00378 (F420 biosynthesis), M00184 (RNA polymerase, archaea), and M00145 (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, chloroplasts and cyanobacteria), resulting in the overlapped pathways mostly enriched from healthy individuals. Within the 11 pathways highlighted in both pipelines, those accounting for energy metabolism (M00157, M00164), RNA polymerase (M00183) and vitamin biosynthesis (M00125) were particularly enriched in control participants. We further identified species contributing predominantly to the highlighted pathways based on the output of HUMAnN2. Resultingly, we found that, despite the dominant species between these two groups were identical, their proportions were different (Figure
3B). A cluster of microorganisms mostly abundant in healthy people, including Escherichia coli, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides vulgatus, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Ruminococcus torques were the leading contributors to the above pathways. In contrast, Manganese/zinc/iron transportation (M00319) also enriched in control individuals was mainly contributed by species belonging to Veillonella genera, including Veillonella atypica, Veillonella dispar and Veillonella parvula. Overall, our findings indicate that shifts in microbial community composition drove a disease-liked state through interference with physiological functions.

To further explore metabolic changes in RNET, untargeted LC-MS metabolomics was applied to detect metabolomes profiles of stool samples from RNET and healthy individuals. PCoA analysis displayed a clear separation of metabolite features between these two groups (adonis: R2 = 0.083, p = 0.001, Figure
4A). After adjusting for gender, BMI, age, smoking and alcohol consumption, we showed that Bray-Curtis similarities were not significantly affected by these parameters (Table S6). Similarly, we also observed significant dissociation by using the orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to assess the quantitative variation in the metabolites between groups (anosim: R = 0.149, p = 0.026, Figure S6A), indicating broad metabolic difference between RNET and control samples. Enrichment analysis revealed a total of 545 faecal metabolites (Figure S7), 104 of which showing significantly different abundances between groups (p < 0.05, the projection value (VIP) > 1.0, Figure
4B). Contradicted to depleted microbial communities in RNET patients, most differential metabolites were remarkably abundant in stool samples from RNET patients (78 metabolites) versus control participants (26 metabolites). Differential metabolites were then assigned to putative molecular superclasses based on comparisons with the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). Intriguingly, we found a total of 38 lipids and lipid-like molecules markedly up-regulated in RNET samples (Figure S6B). Among them, 57.9% (22 of 38) were fatty acyls such as Cohibin C, Cohibin B and Citramalic acid; 26.3% (10 of 38) were glycerophospholipids, including LysoPE (18:1(9Z)/0:0), PC (16:1(9Z)/15:0), and PE (14:0/18:1(11Z)) (Figure S6C). Cohibin C and Cohibin B, belonging to the annonaceous acetogenin group, were mitochondrial complex I inhibitors exerting a range of biological activities, including cytotoxic, immunosuppressive and antiparasitic properties 31, 32. By contrast, organoheterocyclic compounds, organic acids and derivates and organic nitrogen compounds showed distinctively up-regulated in control subjects. KEGG analysis further revealed that glycerophospholipid metabolism as key pathway was significantly altered in patients with RNET (Figure
4C). Together, our results suggested that dysregulation of lipid metabolism was involved in the pathogenesis of RNET.

Aberrations in gut metabolites have been tightly correlated with the pathophysiological processes contributing to IBD, obesity and colorectal cancer, which is a possible reverberation of perturbed microbiome community compositions and functions 33, 34. To understand the association of structure and metabolism of gut microbiota in RNET, we calculated the spearman's correlation of distinctively abundant species and metabolites, and presented a heatmap to highlight the species-metabolite-associated patterns (Figure
5). We revealed a total of 291 significant associations between representative differentially enriched species and metabolites. Roughly, positive correlations were detected between microorganisms and metabolites simultaneously enriched in RNET or controls, and vice versa. For example, Methanobrevibacter smithii was observed to be positively associated with several RNET-specific metabolites such as Cohibin B, Cohibin C and LysoPE(18:1(9Z)/0:0), corroborating the putative mechanistic relationship that positive correlations between species and metabolites could be explained by species producing metabolites, or metabolites benefiting the growth of certain species. Meanwhile, negative associations between control-enriched species and RNET-specific metabolites were also uncovered. Overall, although it remains to be further determined whether these metabolic products are directly metabolized by gut microbiota, our results demonstrate a tight interaction of gut microbial species with metabolites in RNET pathogenesis.

To excavate potential diagnostic microbial and metabolic signatures, we explored whether certain microbial species and metabolites could be utilized to predict RNET status. To this end, we constructed random forest (RF) classifiers based on the differential metabolic and microbial species profiles from control and RNET samples. Classification performance was evaluated using five-fold cross-validation and receiver operating characteristic curves. Notably, this approach enabled us to obtain a panel of gut microbiome and metabolite signatures composed of 3 species and 9 metabolic products, most of which were distinctively abundant in RNET patients (Figure
6A). The identified disease signatures included RNET-specific microbial species such as Varibaculum cambriense and Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium_6_1_45, and a cluster of metabolites. Among these, 5-Aminopentanamide, enriched in RNET, was the most discriminatory signature for the association with RNET. Stomatobaculum longum was the only taxonomic species significantly abundant in healthy group. Likewise, we adjusted these microbial and metabolic based classifiers for gender, age, BMI, smoking and alcohol consumption history, revealing that the identified biomarkers were not significantly influenced by these parameters (Table S7).

All RF classifiers performed markedly better than random in differentiating RNET and controls (Figure
6B). In particular, prediction model pointed out that metabolic signatures attained a high sensitivity in detecting RNET in the discovery cohort, with area under the curve (AUC) value of 1.0. Combination of microbial species and metabolites produced a remarkable improvement in classification accuracy compared with species alone (AUC = 0.96 versus 0.76). Next, we validated this discriminatory model on an additional independent cohort consisting of 15 RNET patient without receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 19 healthy individuals (Figure
6C). Metabolic signatures still achieved higher accuracy for distinguishing RNET patients from controls with an AUC of 0.83. After combing these with microbial markers, the AUC value still reached to 0.74, which is better than microbiota biomarkers alone (AUC = 0.71). Thus, our results suggest the great potential for developing these microbial and metabolic based classifiers as a promising non-invasive tool in early fecal detection of populations with RNET.

US SEER database highlighted a substantially increased prevalence of RNET during the last decades, however, no advancement in outcome was traced over a similar period 35. One possible reason is the lack of messages about mechanistic alterations underlying the development of RNET. To date, apart from a handful of studies focusing on the genetic and epigenetic changes in such neoplasms 36, comprehensive mechanistic characterization is still urgently needed for therapeutic and diagnostic improvement for patients with RNET. To this end, we hereby presented a comprehensive and in-depth study by performing shotgun metagenomic and untargeted metabolomic profiling of faecal samples from RNET and healthy individuals. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first effort to elaborate RNET-specific alteration in human gut microbiome and metabolome in an integrated multi-omics framework.

In summary, our current study delineates a dysbiotic gut ecological microenvironment in patients with RNET, characterized by depleted microbial species and aberrantly aggregated lipids and lipid-like molecules. Although it remains to be further investigated whether these specific species and metabolic compounds directly cause tumorigenesis, disordered ecological structures may contribute to the oncogenic process of such neoplasm. Thus, our findings extend our insights to a potential role of disrupted gut microbiota and metabolites in the pathogenesis of RNET, which may provide promising targets for microbiome-based diagnostics and therapies.
