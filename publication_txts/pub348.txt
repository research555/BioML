Large-scale genome-wide analysis links lactic acid bacteria from food with the gut microbiome

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are fundamental in the production of fermented foods and several strains are regarded as probiotics. Large quantities of live LAB are consumed within fermented foods, but it is not yet known to what extent the LAB we ingest become members of the gut microbiome. By analysis of 9445 metagenomes from human samples, we demonstrate that the prevalence and abundance of LAB species in stool samples is generally low and linked to age, lifestyle, and geography, with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis being most prevalent. Moreover, we identify genome-based differences between food and gut microbes by considering 666 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) newly reconstructed from fermented food microbiomes along with 154,723 human MAGs and 193,078 reference genomes. Our large-scale genome-wide analysis demonstrates that closely related LAB strains occur in both food and gut environments and provides unprecedented evidence that fermented foods can be indeed regarded as a possible source of LAB for the gut microbiome.

For several decades, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been among the most extensively studied microorganisms. LAB have a fundamental role in different biological processes and ecosystems, especially with respect to fermented foods. The microbiology of fermentations has been extensively studied for over a century and the ability to transform raw materials into edible products with defined characteristics dates back to thousands of years as a strategy of food preservation1,2. Industrial fermentations are based on selected cultures that are used as starters or adjuncts to guarantee specific metabolic activities along with quality, reproducibility, and safety. On the other hand, artisanal processes do not usually involve defined starter cultures and the LAB available in the raw materials, or sourced from a previous manufacturer, lead the fermentation. Food-associated LAB have been studied mainly from the perspective of their fermentation performances and phenotypic properties, and knowledge on such properties has recently increased, thanks to intense genome sequencing of LAB strains3,4.

In this study, we perform a large-scale genome-wide analysis of publicly available and newly sequenced food and human metagenomes to investigate the prevalence and diversity of LAB species with a view to identifying links between gut and food microbiomes. We find that LAB species occur with variable prevalence and generally low abundance in the human gut. Such prevalence is affected by age and lifestyle. LAB species identified in food only partially match those in the gut. Comparative genomics suggest an overall food origin for the gut strains.

We performed a large-scale meta-analysis on microbiomes from food sources and human body sites to investigate the prevalence and diversity of LAB species in the human microbiome and their overlap with species and strains found in food. To achieve this goal, we considered 303 food metagenomes (152 publicly available and 151 obtained in this study) (11 datasets; Table 1 and Supplementary Data 1) that we curated in this study, which corresponded to different types of fermented foods and beverages8–14. In addition, we considered 9445 human metagenomes from 47 public datasets spanning multiple body sites (84% from the gut), age categories, countries, and lifestyles, which we retrieved from recent meta-analyses15,16.

We considered reference-based taxonomic profiles17 of all 9445 human metagenomes15,16 (see “Methods”) and focused specifically on LAB species in this study (Supplementary Data 2). We detected 152 species belonging to the Lactobacillales order occurring in at least one of the metagenomes with a relative abundance >0.01%. Among them, we identified 70 species belonging to the LAB group and restricted the following analysis to the 30 of them having a prevalence >0.1% in the human gut (see “Methods”). These represented mainly species (spanning Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Streptococcus, and Weissella genera) of potential food origin, including bacteria occurring in probiotic supplements, in addition to typically non-food origin species such as Lactobacillus mucosae, Lactobacillus ruminis, and Lactobacillus salivarius (Fig. 1). The two most prevalent species in the gut were Streptococcus thermophilus (prevalence 31.2%, i.e., present at >0.01% relative abundance in 31.2% of the gut metagenomes) and Lactococcus lactis (16.3%), both commonly found in dairy products (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1, and Supplementary Data 3). Multiple Lactobacillus species of predominantly food origin were detected at lower prevalence (3–5%) and comprised Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus). Non-food origin bacteria were also identified at remarkable levels such as Lb. ruminis (11.0%), Lb. salivarius (4.7%), and Lb. mucosae (4.0%). Although prevalence was variable, average relative abundance (computed on positive samples only) of single species was generally rather low (<2%), including the case of the two most prevalent species S. thermophilus (0.6%) and Lc. lactis (0.4%). Exceptions (rel. ab. >2%) were verified for Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus buchneri, which however rarely occurred (prev. <1%).

Overall, we found that LAB are a subdominant component of the gut microbiome, although several species exhibited non-negligible contributions. More specifically, we identified 21 LAB occurring with prevalence >1% and 18 with relative abundance >0.5% when detected in the gut. It is reasonable to hypothesize that those species may be short- or long-term colonizers of the human microbiome.

We then stratified the gut metagenomes in terms of host lifestyles (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 3, and Supplementary Data 4), which revealed variations in prevalence and abundance between westernized and non-westernized populations for multiple species. Higher prevalence in westernized populations was observed for six lactobacilli, mostly of food origin, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus (p < 1e − 6), Lb. casei/paracasei (p < 1e − 4), Lb. delbrueckii (p < 0.01), Lb. gasseri (p < 1e − 6), Lb. rhamnosus (p < 1e − 9), and Lactobacillus sakei (p < 1e − 3). By contrast, Lb. mucosae (p < 1e − 8) and Lb. ruminis (p < 1e − 100) that do not occur in food were more prevalent in the non-westernized cohorts. Despite different patterns in terms of prevalence, all lactobacilli were on average more abundant in the westernized populations. Among the other genera, S. thermophilus was highly prevalent in the westernized cohorts (p < 1e − 50). Higher prevalence in the non-westernized group was observed for Lactococcus garvieae (p < 1 − e30) in addition to multiple heterofermentative species such as Leuconostoc citreum (p < 1e − 70), Leuconostoc lactis (p < 1e − 60), Weissella cibaria (p < 1e − 10), and Weissella confusa (p < 1e − 100), which is consistent with their widespread prevalence in raw vegetables23 that are likely consumed in such populations. In fact, non-western populations usually have hunter–gatherer diet and lifestyle, which is recognized to be characterized by high consumption of tubers, drupes, roots, and fruits24,25. Indeed, it was also reported that the!Kung and the Hadza, two non-Western African populations, still obtain 60–80% and 50–65% of their diet from plant foods, respectively26.

We further grouped metagenomes by host country of origin (see “Methods”) and identified more subtle geographical variations (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Overall, food-associated lactobacilli were most prevalent and abundant in Europe, were less so in Asia and North America, and were almost absent in China (kept distinct from the other Asian countries due to its large sample size) and in the non-westernized populations. The higher prevalence in European cohorts was significant (p < 0.05) for Lb. casei/paracasei (8.0%), Lb. delbrueckii (6.6%, with a similar value in Asia), and Lb. rhamnosus (7.1%). Exceptions were Lb. gasseri, having comparable prevalence in continents including westernized cohorts, and Lb. fermentum, more prevalent in North America, South America, and China, with the latter observation being consistent with its widespread occurrence in Chinese fermented foods27. Non-food lactobacilli were not prevalent in Europe. Lb. mucosae exhibited high prevalence (>10%) in Africa, China, and South America, with comparable abundance across the globe. A similar trend was verified for Lb. ruminis, although with higher prevalence in non-westernized cohorts, whereas the presence of Lb. salivarius was distinctive for the Chinese population (p < 0.01). Among the other genera, Lc. lactis exhibited high prevalence across the entire globe (ranging from 11.5% in Africa to 44.4% in South America) with the sole exception of China (1.7%). S. thermophilus reached high prevalence in Asia (41.5%), Europe (39.6%), and North America (28.1%), but was much less prevalent in the Chinese (5.6%) and non-westernized (<3%) cohorts.

We established genome level links between the microorganisms populating the human microbiome and those found in food by integrating the genomes reconstructed from a set of 9445 human metagenomes with those from the set of 303 food metagenomes that we generated, collected, and curated in this work (Table 1 and Supplementary Data 1). More specifically, we considered 303 metagenomic samples spanning 11 datasets and coming from different types of cheese (N = 191), multiple fermented foods (N = 58), nunu (N = 20), milk kefir (N = 18), and yoghurt and dietary supplements (N = 16). We applied a validated16,28 computational pipeline that combined single-metagenome assembly, contig binning, and genome quality control to reconstruct de novo metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the set of food metagenomes (see “Methods”). We generated a total of 666 food MAGs (completeness > 50% and contamination < 5%) of sufficient quality according to previous recommendations29. These MAGs from food were integrated with the set of 154,723 MAGs that we retrieved from the 9445 human metagenomes using the same assembly-based pipeline16 and with the set of 193,078 reference genomes (available in GenBank as of March 2019). This resulted in a total of 348,467 genomes that were clustered at 5% genetic distance based on whole-genome nucleotide similarity estimation and recapitulated in species-level genome bins (SGBs, i.e., clusters of genomes spanning 5% genetic diversity, see “Methods”). The 666 food MAGs were grouped into 171 SGBs (Supplementary Data 5 and  6), which we discuss below on the basis of their occurrence in food samples and human gut (Fig. 2a, b).

The set of genomes reconstructed and the SGBs identified in this study and that we made publicly available (see “Methods”) facilitated a more in-depth comparative genomics analysis.

Within the available set of MAGs and reference genomes, we performed strain-level comparative genomic analysis for the set of 348,467 genomes previously described and comprising 193,078 reference genomes, 154,723 human MAGs, and 666 food MAGs. The 2859 genomes (including 1042 MAGs) associated with the thirty LAB species of interest were kept for comparative genomics purposes. To inform the comparative analysis, we retrieved and manually curated the source types for all genomes (see “Methods”) and grouped MAGs and reference genomes in three categories: human, food, and other. Genomes for which this information was missing were labelled as NA (7.9% of genomes; Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 6, and Supplementary Data 7).

Despite the high number of collected genomes (N = 369), Lb. plantarum was scarcely prevalent (1.8%) and abundant (av. 1.2%) in the gut (Fig. 1), which was reflected by only 11 MAGs being reconstructed from human microbiomes (Supplementary Fig. 7). All of these belonged to the main cluster (96% of the total genomes) associated with subsp. plantarum. A separate cluster was identified as subsp. argentoratensis, which was found in both food and human isolates but never reconstructed from metagenomes. The occurrence of multiple subspecies within the same SGB was also observed for eight additional LAB, i.e., Lb. brevis, Lb. fermentum, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lb. sakei, L. lactis, L. mesenteroides, and W. cibaria, (Supplementary Fig. 7). On the other hand, Lc. garvieae was spread into two different SGBs, with one comprising human MAGs from both westernized and non-westernized populations and the other only from non-westernized cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 7). No genomes from food samples were collected at all for Lactobacillus crispatus, Lb. gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lb. ruminis, and Lb. salivarius (excluding a single isolate from ground beef). The non-food species Lb. ruminis and Lb. salivarius were quite prevalent in the gut with 145 and 42 MAGs reconstructed from human metagenomes, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7). For both species, isolate and MAGs extracted from the gut were distinct from genomes isolated from other animal microbiomes, which suggested long-term adaptation of these species to the human gut. We also identified a specific Lb. salivarius cluster associated with dietary supplement strains, which was found in a couple of saliva samples but never in the human gut.

We finally considered the set of 203 publicly available gut metagenomes from non-human primates (NHPs) that was recently retrieved, curated, and processed with the same pipeline employed in this study28. It comprised 22 host species from 14 different countries in five continents. Among the 2985 reconstructed MAGs, we found that only 46 of them (1.6%) were assigned to the Lactobacillales order (Supplementary Data 8), which suggested an overall low prevalence and abundance of LAB in the NHP gut microbiome. We found strong differences between MAGs retrieved from wild NHPs and those extracted from NHPs living in captivity. Wild NHPs generated 29 MAGs of LAB, with 66% of them associated with new species not available in public repositories and never found in human metagenomes, therefore likely representing bacteria peculiar to the NHP gut microbiomes. Ten MAGs were instead associated with kSGBs, with only five of them belonging to LAB species found also in human gut metagenomes such as Lc. garvieae (N = 3), Lc. lactis, and W. cibaria. Comparative genomics analysis highlighted that the strains harboured in NHPs were quite different from those reconstructed from human microbiomes (Supplementary Fig. 8). Interestingly, the three MAGs of Lc. garvieae resembled more the strains found in non-westernized human populations in terms of nucleotide identity. No MAGs from lactobacilli were extracted at all from wild NHPs. A very different situation was observed in captive NHPs (Supplementary Fig. 8), in which the 17 MAGs were exclusively reconstructed from kSGBs associated with multiple Lactobacillus species, i.e., Lb. acidophilus, Lactobacillus animalis (N = 2), Lb. johnsonii (N = 4), Lb. mucosae (N = 2), Lb. reuteri (N = 5), and Lb. salivarius (N = 3). Strains of Lb. reuteri and Lb. salivarius found in NHPs were distinct from those extracted from human and food sources, which suggested possible host adaptation mechanisms. A stronger overlap among NHPs, human, and food MAGs was instead observed for the other species and likely linked to the sharing of strains due to the exposition of NHPs living in captivity to human-like environments and diets40.

In this study, we showed that food is likely the major source of LAB in the human gut microbiome. This was accomplished by conducting a large-scale meta-analysis that integrated taxonomic profiling and comparative genomics from almost ten thousand metagenomes from human and food sources in addition to reference genomes from public repositories. We focused the analysis on the thirty LAB that exhibited a prevalence >0.1% in the human gut, which resulted mainly in species of potential food origin, including LAB occurring in probiotic supplements, in addition to non-food origin species such as Lb. mucosae, Lb. ruminis, and Lb. salivarius. The comparative genomics suggested that closely related strains are present in both food and gut microbiome. Although such evidence does not exclude the possibility of other potential sources of LAB strains in the gut, we believe that being fermented foods the principal ecological niche for LAB in nature, our results support the hypothesis that food is the major source of LAB for the gut microbiome. While we considered the currently available taxonomic nomenclature, a substantial reclassification of the genus Lactobacillus into 25 novel genera enclosing the current Lactobacillus species was recently proposed41. The new Lactobacillus genus incorporates only the species included in the Lb. delbrueckii group.

The interest in LAB will keep the scientific community active in studies of their genomics and evolution. Some of the LAB species occurring in the gut can surely arise from the consumption of fermented foods or probiotic preparations. However, efforts in research and isolation of LAB from human specimen would be desirable in the future in order to have further evidence on their specific genomic features that may better reflect adaptation to the complex gut ecosystem.

We considered and curated public datasets from fermented food metagenomes in addition to food metagenomes newly sequenced in this study. In total we put together 303 samples spanning 11 datasets and coming from different types of cheese (N = 191), fermented foods (N = 58), nunu (N = 20), milk kefir (N = 18), and yoghurt and dietary supplements (N = 16)8–14. More information is detailed in Table 1. Additional information on the collected food metagenomes is available in Supplementary Data 1.

In addition, we considered publicly available metagenomic datasets corresponding to the human microbiome. More specifically, we included 47 human microbiome datasets totalling 9,445 metagenomes and 4.2e11 Illumina reads as done in ref. 16 (17 metagenomes that were left out due to technical issues in ref. 16 were included here by marginally expanding the original set of 9428 metagenomes). Overall, the samples were acquired from six major body sites: the gut by stool sampling (N = 7907), oral cavity (N = 785), skin (N = 508, including from the anterior nares), airways (N = 151), vagina (N = 86), and breast milk (N = 8, data not included in figures). These samples covered 31 countries that were grouped by continent as follows: Africa (MDG: Madagascar, TZA: Tanzania), Asia (BGD: Bangladesh, BRN: Brunei, IDN: Indonesia, ISR: Israel, KAZ: Kazakhstan, MNG: Mongolia, MYS: Malaysia, SGP: Singapore), China (CHN, which we kept separated from the other Asian countries due to its large sample size), Europe (AUT: Austria, DEU: Germany, DNK: Denmark, ESP: Spain, EST: Estonia, FIN: Finland, FRA: France, GBR: Great Britain, HUN: Hungary, ISL: Iceland, ITA: Italy, NLD: The Netherlands, NOR: Norway, RUS: Russia, SVK: Slovakia, SWE: Sweden), North America (CAN: Canada, USA: United States), Oceania (FJI: Fiji), and South America (PER: Peru). The samples were also categorized as corresponding to westernized (N = 8850) and non-westernized (N = 595) lifestyles16. More specifically, westernization is a complex process that occurred during the last few centuries and that involved lifestyle changes compared with populations prior to the modern era. Such changes include increased hygiene and sanitized environments, introduction of antibiotics and other drugs, increased high-calorie high-fat dietary regimes, enhanced exposure to pollutants, and reduced contact with wildlife and domesticated animals. We adopt westernized and non-westernized as umbrella terms to depict populations that differ by the majority of the aforementioned factors even though this definition comprises heterogeneous populations. Finally, these metagenomes spanned multiple age categories: newborns (N = 711, <1 year of age), children (N = 802, age ≥ 1 and <12 years), school age individuals (N = 215, age ≥ 12 and <19 years), and adults (N = 7669, age ≥ 19 years). Despite curation efforts, age category metadata corresponding to 48 samples could not be sourced. These manually curated metadata are available in the Supplementary Data 2 and in the curatedMetagenomicData package15.

Quantitative taxonomic profiling was applied on the 9,445 human metagenomes and the 303 food metagenomes by applying MetaPhlAn217 with default parameters. MetaPhlAn2 estimates relative abundances of microbial species using the pre-generated ~1 M unique clade-specific marker genes identified from ~17,000 reference genomes (~13,500 bacterial and archaeal, ~3500 viral, and ~110 eukaryotic). Taxonomic profiles along with associated metadata information are available in Supplementary Data 2. We detected 152 species belonging to the Lactobacillales order occurring in at least one of the metagenomes with a relative abundance >0.01%. Among them, we identified 70 species belonging to the LAB group (i.e., species belonging to Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella genera in addition to S. thermophilus), and restricted the rest of the analysis to the 30 of them having a prevalence >0.1% in the human gut. Taxonomic profiles of these 30 species are reported in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs. 1–4. Prevalence was computed by thresholding relative abundance at 0.01%. Average relative abundance was computed on positive samples only.

Taxonomic profiling was coupled with the reconstruction of microbial genomes directly from metagenomes. The approach that we validated in16 was applied here to reconstruct MAGs MAGs from food metagenomes. More specifically, single-sample metagenomics assemblies were generated with metaSPAdes53 (version 3.10.1; default parameters) or IDBA-UD54 (version 1.1.3; default parameters). Contigs longer than 1,000 nt were binned with MetaBAT255 (version 2.12.1; option “-m 1500”). Quality control with CheckM (v. 1.0.7)56 yielded 666 medium-quality food MAGs (completeness > 50% and contamination <5%). These newly reconstructed MAGs were then considered within the human MAG catalogue totalling 154,723 MAGs reconstructed from the 47 human datasets considered in this study16.

The 155,389 MAGs described in the previous section were integrated with the set of 193,078 reference genomes available in GenBank as of March 2019. This resulted in a total of 348,467 genomes that were clustered into SGBs following the procedure proposed in16. Genomes were clustered with average linkage at 5% genetic distance based on whole-genome nucleotide similarity estimation using Mash (v. 2.0; option “-s 10000” for sketching)57. The 666 food MAGs were grouped by this procedure into 171 SGBs: 108 SGBs (comprising 574 MAGs) contained at least one reference genome or human MAG (kSGBs), while a further 63 SGBs (comprising 92 MAGs) consisted only of genomes reconstructed in this study from food metagenomes (fSGBs). Summaries of the newly generated MAGs and SGBs are available in Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Data 5 and  6.

We considered the 30 selected LAB species shown in Fig. 1 for comparative genomics purposes. Among the 348,467 genomes described in the previous section, 2859 genomes (comprising 1042 MAGs) were included in SGBs containing at least one reference genome assigned to these 30 species and were kept for further analyses. We retrieved and manually curated the source type in all cases. For reference genomes, the source of isolation was extracted from the NCBI portal or from related publications. Genomes were grouped in three categories based on the source type: “human,” “food,” and “other.” Genomes for which this information was missing were labelled as “NA” (N = 226, 7.9% of the cases). More information relating to these 2859 genomes is available in Supplementary Data 7.

Phylogenies were built using the newly developed PhyloPhlAn 3.0 package that extends the original PhyloPhlAn2 version58. Each SGB-specific phylogeny (Fig. 3) was based on the set of species-specific marker genes that can be retrieved in PhyloPhlan 3.0 with the command phylophlan2_setup_database.py. The number of marker genes for each SGB is summarized in Supplementary Data 10. This departs from the default option in using the 400 universal markers available in PhyloPhlAn 3.0 and guarantees a higher resolution of the built phylogenies. The parameters were set as follows “--diversity low --fast --min_num_marker 50”, which indicated that genomes mapping less than 50 markers were discarded from the phylogeny. External tools embedded in PhyloPhlan 3.0 were run with their specific options as follows:

Phylogenetic trees (Figs. 3 and 4) were visualized with GraPhlAn64. In addition, multidimensional scaling plots (Figs. 3 and 4, and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5) were built on the whole-genome Average Nucleotide Identity distances computed with FastANI65.

The set of genomes (MAGs and reference genomes) considered in this study was annotated with Prokka (v. 1.12;66) using default parameters. Proteins inferred by Prokka were then processed with Roary67 (v. 3.11; option ‘-i 90’) to generate the presence–absence binary matrix on the core and accessory genes. Gene enrichment within human and food genomes was determined by considering only MAGs and reference genomes having completeness >80% in order to avoid possible biases coming from highly incomplete genomes and by taking into account genes present in at least 5% and <95% of the genomes. Statistical significance was tested through Fisher’s test with false discovery rate correction for multiple hypothesis testing.
