Changes of the human gut microbiome induced by a fermented milk product

The gut microbiota (GM) consists of resident commensals and transient microbes conveyed by the diet but little is known about the role of the latter on GM homeostasis. Here we show, by a conjunction of quantitative metagenomics, in silico genome reconstruction and metabolic modeling, that consumption of a fermented milk product containing dairy starters and Bifidobacterium animalis potentiates colonic short chain fatty acids production and decreases abundance of a pathobiont Bilophila wadsworthia compared to a milk product in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, n = 28). The GM changes parallel improvement of IBS state, suggesting a role of the fermented milk bacteria in gut homeostasis. Our data challenge the view that microbes ingested with food have little impact on the human GM functioning and rather provide support for beneficial health effects.

The gut is inhabited by microbial communities that form an intimate and beneficial association with the host. It is an open microbial ecosystem composed of resident commensals that are continuously exposed to transient exogenous microbes originating from the diet. Many fermented foods and yoghurt in particular, contain high quantities of live bacteria, typically up to 109 CFU/g. These foods have been major contributors to the human diet since the Neolithic Era1, yet our modern understanding of the impact of food-ingested bacteria on our resident gut microbiome remains limited. To date, a majority of studies failed to identify significant modulations of the resident human gut microbiota upon consumption of fermented food2,3,4,5,6. This is likely due to the use of methods lacking sufficient phylogenetic resolution at the species level.

We aimed to use a species-level metagenomic approach to identify specific members of the gut microbiome modulated by the FMP. We found that the FMP potentiated the production of butyrate and others short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and decreased the levels of the opportunistic pathogen, Bilophila wadsworthia. These modifications occurred in parallel with an improvement of IBS symptoms18. Metabolic reconstruction of known and unknown species suggests potential cross-feeding involving the food-ingested bacteria and resident commensals that might be relevant for the overall gut homeostasis.

We administered a FMP or an acidified milk product (MP; 125 g/serving) to subjects fulfilling the Rome III criteria for IBS with constipation (IBS-C) during 4 weeks18 (Figure 1). Bacteria contained in the FMP were Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CNCM I-2494, Streptococcus thermophilus CNCM I-1630 Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CNCM I-1632 and CNCM I-1519 and Lactococcus lactis CNCM I-1631. The consumption of the FMP improved the IBS condition of the subjects compared to the control group (i.e abdominal distension, acceleration of the oro-caecal and colonic transit times, overall IBS symptom severity)18. In order to assess the impact of the FMP on the gut microbiota of the enrolled subjects, we collected their stools before and after the intervention, extracted and sequenced their fecal DNA using a SOLiD v4 Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) device. We compared the sequencing data against the human gut microbiome catalog of 3.3 million genes13.

To validate the sensitivity of the method, we verified that DNA originating from the FMP bacterial species could be efficiently recovered in stool samples. We complemented the human microbiome catalog with 9030 non-redundant genes of the FMP genomes, otherwise absent, to insure an optimum mapping of the reads against the FMP genes. Abundance of all FMP species was significantly increased in stool samples in the FMP group at the end of the study. The low level signal detected at baseline and in control subjects is likely due to the presence of endogenous species phylogenetically close to the FMP species (Figure 2 A/B). B. lactis CNCM I-2494 was the dominant FMP species in stool, in agreement with its relatively high survival in the upper GI tract19,20.

Starting from a comprehensive gene-centric approach, we aimed to reduce data complexity from whole genome sequencing (WGS) reads to individual species. Our bioinformatics pipeline, summarized in figures 1 and S1, relied on 2 key principles: i) Increase (decrease) of a species results in enrichment (deprivation) of the abundance of its genes in the fecal microbiome. Consequently, gene counts should lead to identification of species modulated by the intervention. ii) Genes of a single species should have similar co-abundance profiles across individuals since they are physically linked on a DNA molecule (chromosome, plasmid, phage). As a result co-abundance based gene-clustering leads to identification of clusters of genes corresponding to one bacterial species as already demonstrated14,15.

Integrating both known species and MGS results in a significant gain in statistical power through the compression of the number of variables as compared with the full catalog of 3.3 million genes. The identification of co-variant clusters also yields signatures that are more reliable than a single gene target. We computed the relative abundance of each known or unknown species by averaging the frequency of 50 representative genes for each species, as reported previously36 and compared the abundances using a Wilcoxon paired-test corrected for multiple testing. This revealed that consumption of the FMP stimulated MGS126, MGS203, MGS106, MGS109 and Bifidobacterium dentium. Three species, Parabacteroides distasonis, B. wadsworthia and Clostridium sp. HGF_2 were found to be inhibited (p<0.05) (Figure 2C). In the MP group, only two species, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and MGS204 varied significantly (p<0.05) (Figure 2D).

We then attempted to extend the co-variance approach to the full catalog of 3.3 million genes in order to retrieve other genes of the FMP or MP modulated species. A unique gene of a given cluster was used as a “prey” to “chase” the genes of the catalog co-varying with the prey at a given threshold. Sets of co-varying genes from the full catalog were retrieved in a step by step approach, and formed metagenomics clusters centered around the initial modulated genes identified above. We benchmarked this approach with 10 known species (Table S1), and retrieved an average of 2554 genes per species with a specificity of >95%, illustrating the applicability of this approach for retrieving genes of unique bacterial species (Table S1, cf. supplementary material). We applied the same procedure to the FMP-modulated MGS and retrieved >1900 genes for all the MGS (Figure S5A) but 2 (MGS106, MGS109), which had sub-bacteria-sized gene repertoires and were not further investigated. Five MGS were identified as Clostridiales including Eubacterium (MGS146), Clostridium (MGS134), Roseburia (MGS204) and unknown genera (MGS203, MGS126) and 2 MGS as Bifidobacterium (MGS109, MGS106) (Table 1, Supplementary Material).

The assignments were based on the MEGAN package57.

We concluded that we retrieved nearly complete genomes of the FMP-modulated species, allowing further metabolic and ecological analyses.

The Clostridiales are primary butyrate producers. Our analysis revealed that MGS126, MGS203, MGS204 and Clostridium sp. HGF2 possess the genetic capacity to produce butyrate (Figure 3B).

Butyrogenic bacteria are known to produce propionate as an end product of L-fucose degradation29. The presence of L-fucose degrading genes in the genomes of MGS126 and MGS203 might indicate a metabolic potential to also produce propionate (Table 2).

In order to further assess the impact of the FMP on short chain fatty acid production we used a 5-compartiment ex vivo human colonic fermenter (SHIME ® PRODIGEST)30 inoculated independently with 2 different healthy donors and kept stable for >5 weeks. We observed that the addition of the FMP led to a significant increase of butyrate, propionate and total SCFA, in the 3 different vessels mimicking the ascending, transverse and descending colon conditions as compared with baseline (Figure 4, Figure S7). Butyrate was the SCFA with the largest observed increased registering an average 1.9 fold augmentation across vessels and individuals (Figure 4).

Next, we reasoned that species stimulated (or decreased) by the FMP might have responded to the same environmental intraluminal changes triggered by the ingestion of FMP bacteria. We aimed to have a better insight on habitat type, cell cycle and energy metabolism of the FMP modulated species by identifying shared functions of FMP-stimulated species absent in FMP-inhibited species, and vice-versa. Available genome information of known species and the reconstituted genetic repertoires of MGS were used to perform comparative genomics and identify Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COGs)21 discriminating between FMP-stimulated and inhibited species (Table 2, TableS2).

We further investigated whether inhibited species shared common features that would be absent in stimulated species. Genes encoding a putative carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) were found to be present in B. wadsworthia and Clostridium sp. HGF2 genomes predicting their capacity to use carbon monoxide (CO) as an electron donor33. Heme oxygenase is a known source of intestinal CO and its activity has been shown to be up-regulated during intestinal inflammation34. This suggests that CO utilization might be an advantage in inflamed conditions for organisms able to use it. B. wadsworthia also possesses the set of genes (i.e. HMP0179_00240-00243) allowing anaerobic respiration of nitrate, a substrate that is also enriched during inflammation35.

Fermented foods have been a part of the human diet since ~10 000 BC comprising different matrixes such as milk (i.e kefir, yoghurt, dahi, cheese) or vegetables (i.e. nato, sauerkraut, pickles)1. Beneficial effects of fermented milks were empirically assessed by the Nobel Prize laureate Elie Metchnikoff in 1907 who predicted their role in the enhanced health and longevity of Bulgarian populations36. In the light of our increased understanding of the impact of the gut microbiome on host health, the question arises how food-ingested microbial communities modulate the autochtonous microbiota.

In conclusion, our study sheds light on the potential of the bacteria conveyed by fermented milks to stimulate synthesis of beneficial metabolites and decrease abundance of pathobionts. These modifications can potentially improve health and are thus of importance for public health recommendations in western countries. It indicates that the role of food-ingested bacteria in gut homeostasis has been under-estimated, possibly because of methodological limitations that can, today, be overcome. Elucidation of the intricate links between food ingested microbes and human symbionts can thus be addressed.

The study18, was a single centre, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group design including women (aged 20–69 years), fulfilling the Rome III criteria for IBS-C. Subjects were asked to not consume probiotic-containing products or fermented dairy products. There was no dietary record. After an 11-day wash-out period, 32 subjects (Per Protocol) consumed (125 g/serving) twice a day either the FMP (n = 17) or an acidified milk product (MP) (n = 15) for 4 weeks. Out of 64 stools collected within the PP population, 56 samples (n = 26 and 30, for FMP and MP, respectively) passed DNA quality control and were used for further analyses. Other dairy products and probiotics were excluded from the diet.

The FMP contained 1.25 × 1010 colony forming units per serving (cfu/serving) Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (strain number I-2494 in the French National Collection of Cultures of Micro-organisms (CNCM), Paris, France), 1.2 × 109 cfu/serving of Streptococcus thermophilus (CNCM I-1630) Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (CNCM I-1632 and CNCM I-1519) and Lactococcus lactis (CNCM I-1631). The MP was an acidified milk product with low lactose content. FMP and MP were provided by Danone Research (Palaiseau, France).

Stool samples were collected before and after the 4-week consumption period. Immediately after defecation, a fecal sample was collected and stored in RNAlater solution (Ambion). The fecal suspension was homogenized and the volume of RNAlater was adjusted to achieve a final fecal dilution of 1:10 (wt/vol). 200 µl of the 10-fold dilution were added to 1 ml of Phosphate Buffered Saline (Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 × g. The supernatant was discarded and the fecal pellet stored at −80°C. Fecal DNA was extracted as previously described52. DNA samples were sequenced on a SOLiD v4 NGS (Life Technologies) following the standard protocol for fragment libraries. The raw SOLiD read data was deposited in the EBI European Nucleotide Archive under the accession number PRJEB7171.

Our bioinformatics pipeline, summarized in the Figure S1, aimed to decrease data complexity starting from reads and identify bacterial species modulated by the intervention. In brief, 50-bases tags (reads) were generated with SOLiD v4 sequencer, mapped on the MetaHIT 3.3 million genes catalog and genes count profiles were generated for each individual. Genes potentially modulated upon the intervention (intra-group analysis) were identified with a Kruskall-Wallis test, clustered and assigned to known or unknown species. Relative abundance of a given species was computed by averaging the frequency of 50 genes belonging to the species. DNA from the samples (n = 28) was sequenced with a SOLiD v4 sequencer and an average of 3.97 × 107 50-bases tags (reads) per sample were generated and mapped on the MetaHIT 3.3 million genes catalog13 (average 1.71 × 107 reads/sample; S.D. +/− 7.79 × 106) using METEOR, an in-house software53. Only those tags that mapped uniquely (univocally) to a single gene and to the exclusion of FMP genomes were retained (1.30 × 107 reads/sample; S.D. +/− 5.88 × 106). To quantify FMP species, the catalog of 3.3 million genes was complemented by the non-redundant genes (n = 9030) of the FMP genomes4,54. Genes count profiles were generated for each individual and genes significantly enriched or depleted upon the intervention (intra-group analysis) were identified with a Kruskall-Wallis test. Clusters of genes or species counting less than 9 (or 5) genes in the FMP (or MP) group were disregarded since these clusters are more likely to have resulted from random variations (see supplementary material).

The genetic repertoire of unknown species was reconstituted through comparison of this study's gene clusters and the co-variation within the 3.3 million gene catalog across the MetaHIT cohort15. Functions for each clustered or reference genome genes were predicted using COG and/or NOG assignments. When available, COG assignment was performed using the Batch Web CD-Search online tool (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/bwrpsb/bwrpsb.cgi). Predicted functions were projected on KEGG metabolic pathways using the Ipath software55 and compared to essential genes identified in the model organism Bacillus subtilis56. When species-level taxonomy could not be assigned, higher taxonomic levels were assigned using MEGAN57. Relative abundance was computed as the average frequency of 50 randomly selected genes of a species. Wilcoxon paired test, corrected for multiple tests by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, was used to test the significance of the FMP or MP effects.

Genes involved in butyrate production from Roseburia intestinalis or Coprococcus eutactus25 were used as references to retrieve homologs present in the human gut microbiome catalog by using a bi-directional BlastP. Such genes were re-organized into co-varying clusters, hereafter called butyrate modules, which belong to unique species (cf supplementary material). Relative abundance of the butyrate modules was calculated as the mean of the relative abundance of the genes composing the module. Wilcoxon paired test was used to test the statistical significance of the variation upon interventions (intragroup analysis). For intergroup comparisons, a one-way ANCOVA (Analysis of Co-Variance) was used on the change from baseline for each butyrate module with the group as factor. The relative abundance at baseline was considered as covariate. A Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction was applied to control the False Discovery Rate.

In vitro colonic fermentation model (SHIME® (Prodigest, Belgium)) mimicking the adult gastro-intestinal tract was used to assess the impact of FMP on production of gut microbial derived SCFA58. The system was inoculated with fecal sample from healthy adults (n = 2). After two-week stabilization period, 50 g of FMP was added daily to the stomach compartment during 3 weeks. The 3 vessels mimicking the ascending, transveral and descending colons were sampled 3 times a week. Concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid were measured by liquid gas chromatography. A two-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) was used to evaluate the impact of FMP consumption on the production of SCFA. The first factor was the period of treatment and the second was the week of sampling nested in the period treatment. Tukey-Kramer post-hoc tests were used to determine which comparisons were significantly different if needed. Normality of residuals and homogeneity of variance were checked to validate ANOVA hypothesis. When the hypothesis of homogeneity of variance between groups was violated, the variance by week was used instead of a pooled variance to allow the use of ANOVA.
