Bacterial Taxa and Functions Are Predictive of Sustained Remission Following Exclusive Enteral Nutrition in Pediatric Crohn’s Disease

The gut microbiome is extensively involved in induction of remission in pediatric Crohn’s disease (CD) patients by exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN). In this follow-up study of pediatric CD patients undergoing treatment with EEN, we employ machine learning models trained on baseline gut microbiome data to distinguish patients who achieved and sustained remission (SR) from those who did not achieve remission nor relapse (non-SR) by 24 weeks.

A total of 139 fecal samples were obtained from 22 patients (8–15 years of age) for up to 96 weeks. Gut microbiome taxonomy was assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and functional capacity was assessed by metagenomic sequencing. We used standard metrics of diversity and taxonomy to quantify differences between SR and non-SR patients and to associate gut microbial shifts with fecal calprotectin (FCP), and disease severity as defined by weighted Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index. We used microbial data sets in addition to clinical metadata in random forests (RFs) models to classify treatment response and predict FCP levels.

Microbial diversity did not change after EEN, but species richness was lower in low-FCP samples (<250 µg/g). An RF model using microbial abundances, species richness, and Paris disease classification was the best at classifying treatment response (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.9). KEGG Pathways also significantly classified treatment response with the addition of the same clinical data (AUC = 0.8). Top features of the RF model are consistent with previously identified IBD taxa, such as Ruminococcaceae and Ruminococcus gnavus.

Our machine learning approach is able to distinguish SR and non-SR samples using baseline microbiome and clinical data.

Crohn’s disease (CD) is a major form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract causing chronic relapsing inflammation.1 Crohn’s disease is characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and many other symptoms detrimental to quality of life. Incidence of pediatric-onset IBD is on the rise globally2 and in Canada, especially in Nova Scotia.3 Inflammatory bowel disease is thought to manifest in genetically susceptible individuals that exhibit an exaggerated immune response to intestinal microbes when exposed to environmental triggers,4 but an exact etiology remains elusive.5 The rising incidence and increasingly early onset of IBD substantiates a need to further investigate the etiology of the disease.

In this study, we present a follow-up on a cohort of 22 pediatric CD patients undergoing EEN to induce remission.22 We investigated the impact of EEN on gut microbiome composition and employed machine learning using microbiome data to distinguish patients that maintained remission compared with those that did not achieve remission or relapsed upon reintroduction to normal diet. Our aim was to develop a predictive model to identify the features of the CD gut microbiome most predictive of a patient’s response to EEN treatment. We found that a model using input from microbiome data and Paris disease classification was the most informative in distinguishing response to EEN.

Twenty-two pediatric CD patients receiving gastroenterology specialist care at the IWK Health Centre (Halifax, NS, Canada) were prospectively recruited to the MAREEN (a metagenomic approach to diagnosis, induction, and maintenance of deep remission after exclusive enteral nutrition in pediatric Crohn’s disease) study. Diagnosis of CD was based on standard histological, endoscopic, and radiological criteria, as previously described.22 All patients were treated with EEN via nasogastric/gastric tubing for at least 12 weeks. Clinical data were collected at regularly scheduled follow-up visits at the GI clinic. Clinical metadata including disease activity and serology results were collected from patient medical records. These study data were managed using the REDCap electronic data capture tool hosted at the IWK Health Centre.23, 24 Clinical remission was defined by weighted Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (wPCDAI) score ≤12.5.25 Disease severity was classified by recommended wPCDAI cut-offs from Turner et al: remission (≤12.5), mild (>12.5 to <40), moderate (≥40 to >57.5), and severe (≥57.5).25 Sustained remission (SR) was defined as establishing and maintaining remission through week 24 of treatment. Patients who experienced a relapse or flare of disease before week 12 or before week 24 (after reintroduction of normal diet but often with ongoing partial enteral nutrition with formula) were classified as non-SR. Additional medications, Paris classification of disease,26 sex, and age of patients are shown in Table 1.

Fecal calprotectin was quantified for 132 stool samples that were stored at −80ºC before processing. Fecal calprotectin levels were quantified using the EliA Calprotectin 2 automated immunoassay on the Phadia 250 platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Stool samples were stored at −20°C following collection and stored at −80°C until analysis. DNA was isolated from 139 stool samples in total for bacterial identification using the Stool DNA Isolation Kit according to manufacturer instructions (NORGEN Biotek, Thorold, ON, Canada).

Variable regions V4-V5 of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene were amplified from extracted DNA using PCR conditions and custom primers as described in the Microbiome Helper protocol.27 The forward (515FB = GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and reverse (926R = CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) primers used Nextera Illumina index tags and sequencing adapters fused to the 16S sequences. Each sample was amplified with a different combination of index barcodes to allow for sample identification after multiplex sequencing. After amplification, paired-end 300 + 300 bp v3 sequencing was performed for all samples on the Illumina MiSeq at the Integrated Microbiome Resource (http://imr.bio/) of Dalhousie University.

Analysis of 16S sequencing data was carried out on a dedicated server using the Microbiome Helper workflow27 (https://github.com/LangilleLab/microbiome_helper/wiki/Amplicon-SOP-v2). First, primer sequences were removed from sequencing reads using cutadapt (v 1.14),28 and primer-trimmed files were imported into QIIME2 (v. 2019.4.0).29 Forward and reverse paired-end reads were joined using VSEARCH (v 2.9.0)30 and input into Deblur31 to correct reads and obtain amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). In total, 21,757 unique ASVs were observed, with a mean read depth of 15,305 sequences across 139 samples. Amplicon sequence variants that had a frequency of less than 0.1% of the mean sample depth were removed from downstream analysis (<15 counts). After filtering of rare ASVs, there were 1053 unique ASVs that remained. MAFFT (v 7.407)32 was used to build a multiple-sequence alignment of ASVs, which was input into FastTree33 to construct a phylogenetic tree. Taxonomy was assigned to ASVs using the SILVA rRNA gene database34 and the “feature-classifier” option in QIIME2. Estimates of alpha-diversity (Observed ASVs, Shannon Diversity), beta-diversity (weighted UniFrac), and relative abundance of ASVs were obtained using QIIME2 (v 2019.4). Sequencing results were rarified to 3000 reads per sample to acquire diversity metrics and compare taxonomy between samples, omitting 6 samples from further 16S analysis. To determine whether levels of individual bacterial taxa were significantly different between clinical characteristics, the graphical software package STAMP was used.35 To test for difference in individual taxa between groups of samples, the Welch 2-sided t test with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) testing was employed. For testing 3 or more groups, STAMP uses the ANOVA test with FDR correction.

At least 1 nanogram of each purified DNA sample was subjected to Nextera XT (Illumina, San Diego, CA) library preparation per the manufacturer’s instructions, but clean-up and normalization were completed using the Charm Just-a-Plate Purification and Normalization Kit (Charm Biotech, Cape Girardeau, MO). Complete libraries were then pooled and sequenced in a portion of a 150 + 150 bp PE NextSeq run (Illumina Hi-Output v2 300 cycle kit), with a mean read depth of 5,304,747 reads per sample. The Microbiome Helper27 metagenomic standard operating procedure was followed (https://github.com/LangilleLab/microbiome_helper/wiki/Metagenomics-standard-operating-procedure-v2). Forward and reverse sequencing reads were first concatenated into a single FASTQ file per sample and run through the kneaddata pipeline for sequence preprocessing. Kneaddata uses Trimmomatic36 to remove low-quality sequences and Bowtie237 to screen out human and PhiX174 contaminant sequences. Trimmomatic removes reads smaller than 50 base pairs, and those with low-quality scores (PHRED <Q20). Humann238 (v.0.11.2) was used to functionally annotate the metagenomic sequencing reads into MetaCyc metabolic pathways and KEGG orthologs (KOs). Amplicon sequencing data for each sample are available at the European Nucleotide Archive (accession PRJEB33603).

Random forest (RF) models were run on baseline samples to classify predictive accuracy of 16S rRNA data sets, MetaCyc pathways, and KOs in classifying SR and NR samples. Each data set was preprocessed so only features with >20% of samples having non-zero values were retained. Features were standardized by sample by subtracting each sample’s mean and dividing by the sample’s standard deviation (Z-score standardization). We ran RF models using the randomForest39 R package (v 4.6.12) with default mtry values. All models were run with 1001 trees, and model significance was determined by the permutation test from the rfUtilities40 R package (v 2.0-0). Leave-one-out cross-validation was also run on each data set to output an accuracy metric for each model using the R package caret41 (v 6.0–73). Abundances of taxonomic and functional features of each sample were also regressed against their respective FCP levels to assess feature importance of explaining variance in FCP.

Informed consent was obtained from all study participants or their parent/guardian. The MAREEN study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the IWK Health Centre.

Demographics and clinical characteristics of the cohort are presented in Table 1. All 22 patients enrolled in the study provided baseline (week 0) stool samples before starting EEN. Two patients withdrew before week 12 of EEN therapy, and the remaining 20 patients provided an additional 1 to 9 samples during follow-up to a maximum of 96 weeks (Supplementary Table 1) for a total of 139 samples.

The 16S rRNA gene was directly sequenced from all 139 stool samples obtained from the cohort. We examined the association of microbial diversity and taxonomic composition in each sample with widely used parameters for disease activity—FCP concentration (µg/g) and wPCDAI score.21 FCP levels were detected in 132 samples (median 1591 [10.0 – 6976] µg/g). Disease activity at the time of sampling was determined by calculating wPCDAI score. Fecal calprotectin levels and wPCDAI scores themselves were weakly correlated (Pearson correlation = 0.49; P = 2.41E-06; Supplementary Fig. 1). However, FCP levels were highest in samples associated with severe disease activity (wPCDAI ≥ 57.5, n = 6), reaching significance when compared with samples associated with remission (wPCDAI ≤12.5, n = 70; 4325 vs 1737 µg/g; P = 0.0013; Fig. 1A). We examined the relationship between species richness and FCP, and using the accepted FCP clinical cut-off value of 250 µg/g,42 we found that samples with low FCP (<250 µg/g; n = 27) had significantly lower species richness than samples with high FCP (≥250 µg/g; n = 105; Fig. 1B). Samples associated with severe disease activity (“severe” samples, wPCDAI ≥ 57.5) had the lowest species richness, trending toward significance when compared with samples associated with remission (“remission” samples, wPCDAI ≤ 12.5; Fig. 1C).

There were 29 taxa in total that were differentially abundant among the 4 sample subgroups defined by disease activity (eg, remission, mild, moderate, severe), 27 of which had the highest abundance in severe samples. Of these 27 taxa, 4 bacterial genera were significantly increased including Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, Hungatella, and Eikenella (Fig. 1D). Fusobacterium showed the greatest difference, with a 3.05% greater average relative abundance in severe CD samples. The bacterial families Carnobacteriaceae, Campylobacteraceae, and Neisseriaceae, and Dialister sp. were also increased in abundance in severe CD. Twenty-seven taxa in total had an increased relative abundance in remission samples compared with severe samples (Supplementary Table 2). We also compared taxonomic differences between high and low FCP samples and found 10 taxa present in greater abundance in high FCP samples (Supplementary Table 2). We also analyzed patients who exhibited perianal features at baseline endoscopy (n = 12) compared with those without (n = 10) and found no differentially abundant taxa.

Of the 22 patients enrolled in the study, 19 patients had complete clinical follow-up data available to assess response to EEN (Table 1). Of these, 15 (79%) achieved clinical remission as defined by wPCDAI scores ≤12.5 by week 12. By week 24, 13 (68%) remained in remission and were classified as sustained remission (SR). The 6 patients that did not achieve or remain in clinical remission were classified as non-SR.

To define microbial communities associated with “deep sustained remission” (DSR), we classified samples with both an FCP <250 µg/g and wPCDAI <12.5 as being in DSR. At week 24, 2 patients fulfilled these criteria. We carried out principal coordinates analysis (PCA) using weighted UniFrac43 in QIIME. At baseline, DSR samples did not differ from non-DSR. At week 24, the beta-diversity as measured by UniFrac was significantly different in DSR samples (n = 2) compared with non-DSR samples (n = 18; Supplementary Fig. 2; R = 0.63; P = 0.023, adonis test). Bacteroides sp. was found to be significantly more abundant in non-DSR samples compared with DSR samples at week 24 after FDR correction (P = 0.0051). On a PCoA plot, the samples were visible outliers.

To determine the relationship between microbial functions and disease activity and response to EEN in our cohort, we looked at the presence of metagenomic sequencing (MGS)–determined microbial functions (MetaCyc pathways, KEGG orthologs, KEGG pathways, and KEGG modules) among 4 different sample groupings based on clinical metadata: high vs low FCP, remission vs severe disease activity, all 4 categories of disease activity, and the subgroup of SR vs non-SR in week 0 and week 12 samples. There were 174 differentially abundant functions across various clinical metadata groupings (Supplementary Table 3). In samples associated with remission, there were 111 functions in higher relative abundance when compared with samples associated with severe disease activity.

We next investigated how well taxonomic and functional data sets classify SR and non-SR samples using baseline microbiome data before induction of EEN therapy. Taxonomic data from 16S sequencing and functional profiles from MGS were used as input for random forest machine learning models to distinguish SR and non-SR samples at baseline. Microbial sequence data from all samples were used in the RF model except for samples from patient CD1 (due to concomitant medications at baseline) and patients CD14, CD17, and CD21 (due to incomplete follow-up data, Table 1). The 16S data sets used as model classifiers were ASV, species, genus, and family taxonomic data. Functional data sets from MGS included KEGG ortholog, pathway, and module counts, in addition to MetaCyc pathways. A total of 8 data sets were used as classifiers for treatment response, each mean-centered and scaled by the standard deviation in each sample. We ran independent RF models to determine the accuracy of each data set of classifying SR and non-SR samples. The only significant taxonomic data set predicting treatment response was ASVs (P = 0.047). None of the functional data sets were significant classifiers on their own.

Random forest models output variable importance metrics for each feature used in the model. The most informative taxa in the top predictive model were Ruminococcaceae UCG-002, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136, Bacteroides, and Parabacteroides (Fig. 4A). Although the Paris classification of disease location and behavior improved the model’s AUC, neither metric showed up in the top 30 most important features for classification. In the top MGS model, the 3 top KEGG pathways were (1) ko4910: insulin signaling, (2) ko03013: RNA transport, and (3) ko02010: ABC transporters. Interestingly, disease behavior was the second most informative feature of the MGS model (Fig. 4B).

Amplicon sequence variant abundance data were also input into an RF model that regressed against FCP levels to determine predictive power of individual taxa. The model was significant in regression against FCP levels (P = 0.001) and explained 17% of the variance in FCP levels. The top 20 taxa important in predicting FCP levels are shown in Figure 5A. The majority of informative taxa belonged to the phylum Firmicutes (12), followed by Proteobacteria (4), Bacteroides (2), and 1 taxon each from Fusobacteria and Actinobacteria. Nine taxa from the Lachnospiraceae family were in the top 30 most informative taxa, including the 2 most informative features (Lachnoclostridium sp. and Ruminococcus gnavus group). Six taxa from the Ruminococcaceae family were also in the top 30 features of the model. This FCP RF model and the treatment response model shared 11 of their 30 top ASVs (Table 2).

When KEGG pathway relative abundances were used in a regression model, they explained considerably less of the variance in FCP levels but resulted in a significant predictive model (P = 0.003; 4.54% variance explained). The FCP regression and treatment response RF models using MGS functions shared 9 of the top 30 features (Table 2), including the top feature in the FCP regression model (ko00440: phosphonate and phosphonate metabolism).

In this study, we highlight gut microbiome changes in response to EEN treatment and use microbial data sets as features in machine learning models to predict treatment response and FCP levels. The patients in this study show similar remission rates (79% at week 12) to previous cohorts undergoing treatment with EEN.6–8 The majority of patients who undergo EEN treatment are reported to exhibit decreased microbial alpha diversity (richness) after the completion of treatment,19 but no changes in microbial diversity were observed in our cohort after EEN (Fig. 2A). Similarly, there were no differentially abundant taxa between samples at baseline, week 12, and week 24.

In addition to the limitations described previously with regards to the relatively poor correlation of real-life clinical course with single-timepoint disease activity, FCP measurements, and endoscopy, the current analysis differs in a number of crucial aspects from our preliminary report, which makes direct comparison of the results difficult. Herein, we used amplicon sequence variants, a technique that has improved resolution and lacks the need of a reference database,63 rather than the previous technique of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) construction. We also employed sequencing of the V4-V5 variable region, whereas the preliminary MAREEN analysis used the V6-V8 region. Choice of variable region to target for sequencing can affect taxonomic resolution and results, and should be considered when comparing microbiome results across studies.64

In conclusion, we leveraged machine learning and standard microbiome analysis techniques to characterize the gut microbiome in children with CD undergoing treatment with EEN. We found reduced overall microbial diversity in samples with lower fecal calprotectin levels. In contrast to several reports of decreased microbial alpha-diversity in pediatric CD patients after EEN,19 we observed that bacterial alpha-diversity based on ASVs is not altered by EEN, irrespective of treatment response. Several taxa are increased in non-SR patients at week 12, namely the phylum Verrucomicrobia. Using wPCDAI scores to stratify patients by disease severity based on their wPCDAI levels, we found several taxa to be differentially abundant, especially between remission and severe CD samples. Several of these taxa have been previously associated with IBD, whereas some were novel associations, such as Hungatella. Using baseline microbial data and clinical observations, we then built machine learning models to accurately predict remission with EEN treatment. We found that microbial taxonomic data, alpha-diversity, and Paris classifications of disease behavior and location produced the most informative predictive model. Functions obtained from metagenomic sequencing were not significantly informative on their own but made a significant contribution to the model in conjunction with the same additional metadata. These results suggest that using patient metadata, including disease classification and clinical biomarkers, in addition to gut microbial information may improve future diagnostics and should be validated in larger cohorts to reveal a more robust interplay between longitudinal disease activity and gut microbial composition. Overall, we demonstrated that machine learning models can be employed to predict treatment response to EEN. Further studies are needed to validate the use of machine learning to identify the subgroup of patients most likely to respond to dietary intervention and to optimize nutritional interventions for maintenance of remission.
