The Gut Microbiome and Gastrointestinal Toxicities in Pelvic Radiation Therapy: A Clinical Review

A substantial proportion of cancer patients receive radiotherapy (RT) during their cancer trajectory. One of the most challenging pelvic RT-related toxicities are gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities (e.g., abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, faecal incontinence, and diarrhoea) which impair the quality of life (QoL) of patients. Mounting evidence suggests that gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in health and disease, including cancer. Our current clinical review aims to assess the impact of RT on gut microbiota and GI toxicities in cancer patients to provide useful information, in addition to standard care, for clinicians and patients.

Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities are common adverse effects of pelvic radiotherapy (RT). Several recent studies revealed that toxicity of RT is associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiome. Method: A literature search was conducted in electronic databases Medline, PubMed, and ScienceDirect, with search terms “microbiome and/or microbiota” and “radiotherapy (RT) and/or chemoradiation therapy (CRT)” and “cancer”, and the relevant literature were selected for use in this article. Results: Eight prospective cohort studies were selected for review with a total of 311 participants with a range of 15–134 participants within these studies. The selected studies were conducted in patients with gynaecological (n = 3), rectal (n = 2), or prostate cancers (n = 1), or patients with various types of malignancies (n = 2). Three studies reported that cancer patients had significantly lower alpha diversity compared with healthy controls. Seven studies found that lower alpha diversity and modulated gut microbiome were associated with GI toxicities during and after pelvic RT (n = 5) and CRT (n = 2), whereas one study found that beta diversity was related to a complete response following CRT. Two further studies reported that fatigue was associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and low alpha diversity during and after RT, and with dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and diarrhoea, respectively. Conclusion: Gut microbiome profiles are associated with GI toxicities and have the potential to predict RT/CRT-induced toxicities and quality of life (QoL) in patients undergoing those treatments. Further robust randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are required to elucidate the effect of gut microbiome profiles on RT-related adverse effects and responses to RT.

Radiotherapy (RT) is a standard cancer treatment for both curative and palliative patients and is often combined with chemotherapy to treat cancer, prevent recurrence of cancer, and improve quality of life (QoL) [1]. Approximately 50 percent of all cancer patients receive RT during their cancer trajectory [2]. Despite the benefits of RT in oncology being well established, RT-induced toxicities may detract from the therapeutic ratio. One of the most challenging pelvic RT-related toxicities are gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities (e.g., abdominal pain, tenesmus, rectal bleeding, faecal incontinence, and diarrhoea) which impairs the QoL of patients receiving RT in the abdominopelvic regions. Severe GI toxicities not only affect cancer patient’s QoL but may add to the cost of medical treatment, including additional use of analgesics and pain medication, prolonged hospital stays, and the interruption of cancer treatment [3,4]. However, as yet there are no effective strategies to predict and/or proactively manage RT treatment-induced GI toxicities.

Results: A total of 987 studies were initially identified from the three electronic databases (Medline, PubMed, and ScienceDirect). After an in-depth evaluation and screening of titles and abstracts, 73 articles remained to be further assessed for eligibility for inclusion in the study. Eight studies were included in the review (Figure 1, and Table 1 and Table 2).

The eight prospective studies included total of 311 participants with a range of 15–134 within each study, with 182 in the RT (intervention) group, 109 in the CRT (intervention) group, and 20 in the healthy control group. Studies were conducted on participants with gynaecological (n = 3) [23,24,25], rectal (n = 2) [26,27], prostate (n = 1) [28], and various types of cancer (n = 2) [29,30]. Two studies each were conducted in China [23,30], Korea [24,26], and the USA [25,27], and one study each in France [29] and the UK [28]. The earliest RCT was published in 2008 [29]. Four studies were two-arm prospective observational studies [24,28,29,30], while the other four studies were one-arm [23,25,26,27,28]. Total RT treatments comprised 25 sessions (50 Gy, 1.8–2.0 Gy/day, 5 times/week, 5 days) in five studies, while one study each varied in RT treatment dosage with 70–75 Gy for prostate cancer, 50–60 Gy for pelvic lymph nodes [28], and 51–53 Gy for rectal cancer [27]. One study did not describe RT dosage level [25]. Studies were conducted with patients receiving RT (n = 5) and CRT (n = 3) [25,26,27]. The primary outcome measures for GI toxicities included enteritis [23], enteropathy [24,28], bowel function [25], diarrhoea [29], diarrhoea-related fatigue [30], CRT-related fatigue [27], and response to RT [26]. Seven studies analysed the gut microbiome profile with the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S-rRNA) gene sequencing method (n = 7) and one study with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Interestingly, analysis of gene sequencing regions of 16S rRNA varied across studies: V1–V2 [24,26,28] (n = 3), V4 [23,25] (n = 2), V3 [30] (n = 1), and V3–V4 [27] regions of 16S rRNA (n = 1), and 16S rRNA position 968–1401 in E. coli [29] (n = 1).

Of eight individual studies (RT (n = 5) and CRT (n = 3)) [23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30], three studies [24,29,30] compared alpha diversity of the gut microbiome between cancer patients and healthy control groups before undergoing RT. Three studies consistently reported that, when compared with controls, cancer patients had significantly lower alpha diversity.

Of eight individual studies [23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30], seven studies compared the impact of pelvic RT (n = 5) [23,24,28,29,30] and CRT (n = 2) [25,27] on alpha diversity and found that diversity decreased after pelvic RT and CRT, whereas one study did not report any findings [26].

Of five individual studies [23,24,28,29,30], four studies compared alpha diversity in patients either with or without diarrhoea and found that there was significantly lower alpha diversity in patients with diarrhoea [23,24,29,30]. Two studies assessed the relationship between alpha diversity and severity of enteritis and found that lower diversity was consistently associated with RT-related enteritis [28,30]. One study assessed RT-related symptoms of fatigue and diarrhoea and suggested that diarrhoea significantly increased fatigue scores at the third and fifth week of RT (p < 0.01), whereas fatigue scores of patients with no diarrhoea increased slightly [30].

A recent study conducted on patients with prostate cancer in the UK showed that patients with radiation enteropathy (RE) have higher counts of Roseburia, Clostridium IV, and Faecalibacterium (p < 0.05), and reported that intestinal mucosa cytokines (IL7, IL12/IL23p40, IL15, and IL16) were related to radiation enteropathy and inversely correlated with counts of Roseburia and Propionibacterium [28]. This study also reported that decreased SCFA production was significantly associated with enteritis [28]. Two studies conducted in China consistently demonstrated that RT-induced diarrhoea was related to a higher ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroides [23,30]. A study of patients with cervical cancer (n = 18) found that genera Serratia, Bacteroides, and Prevotella_9 were the most abundant in RE patients, while the proportion of Bacteroides was markedly reduced (21.23% vs. 43.83%, ρ = 0.004) [23]. Other minor genera that were significantly less abundant in RE patients were Blautia (ρ = 0.010) and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-003 (ρ = 0.048) [23]. Another study in patients with both cervical and colorectal cancer (n = 11) compared patient groups (no diarrhoea vs. diarrhoea) following RT and found significantly higher levels of Alistipes, Bacteroides, Clostridium_XI, Erysipelotrichaceae, Escherichia, Lachnospiracea, and Megamonas in patients who developed diarrhoea, whereas Clostridium_XIVa and Sutterella were significantly lower in these patients [30]. Two studies found that, at the phylum level, Actinobacteria was related to cancer and RE [24,29]. Another study of patients with gynaecological cancer (n = 9) in Korea reported that Actinobacteria was 30 times higher in cancer patients than in healthy individuals [24]. An earlier study in France conducted with patients with abdominal cancer (n = 10) found that patients with diarrhoea had increased levels of Actinobacteria after RT, although its presence was not detected in patients without diarrhoea prior to RT [29].

Recently, three studies examined the effect of CRT on the gut microbiome [25,26,27]. One study assessed the effect of CRT on fatigue and the gut microbiome in patients with rectal cancer (n = 29) in the USA and reported that decreased alpha diversity of the gut microbiome increased fatigue after CRT [27]. They found that the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was significantly higher in patients with fatigue compared with those who were not fatigued (p < 0.05). They also found that Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla and Escherichia, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Oscillospira were most abundant at the genus level (p < 0.05) in patients with fatigue, while the Firmicutes phylum, including members of the Lactobacillaceae family such as Lactobacillus genus, were significantly enriched in patients who were not fatigued (p < 0.05) [27]. Another study in the USA assessed the effect of CRT on bowel function and the gut microbiome in patients with advanced cervical cancer (n = 29) and found that alpha diversity and the relative abundance of Clostridiales had declined over time, while other phyla were relatively stable [25]. This study reported that higher alpha diversity was correlated with lower GI toxicities during and after CRT, but not with baseline diversity. Another recent study [24], conducted with preoperative patients with rectal cancer (n = 45), assessed the impact of CRT on the gut microbiome and reported that seven patients (16%) demonstrated pathologically complete responses (CR), and 38 patients (84%) showed non-CR after preoperative concurrent CRT. They also found a significant difference in beta diversity (p = 0.028) between patients with CR and non-CR, but not in alpha diversity. In this study, Cyanobacteria, the family of Corynebacteriaceae and Clostridiaceae, were dominant in the CR group, while Bacteroidales (Bacteroidaceae, Rikenellaceae, Bacteroides) were relatively more abundant in patients with non-CR.

A significant finding in this review is that low alpha diversity and dysbiosis of the gut microbiome are associated with GI toxicities induced by pelvic RT. Although a number of studies (n = 8) were conducted with heterogeneous cancer populations, viz., rectal cancer (n = 2), cervical cancer (n = 2), prostate cancer (n = 1), and mixed cancer groups (n = 3), seven studies examined the relationship between bacterial diversity and composition of the gut microbiome. In these studies, GI-related adverse events were consistently found to be related to low alpha diversity and dysbiosis of the gut microbiome following RT [23,24,25,27,28,29,30]. Of those studies, three compared the diversity of the gut microbiome in cancer patients and healthy controls, and identified that, compared with healthy controls, alpha diversity was lower in cancer patients [24,29,30]. These findings are similar to previous reviews conducted with various medical conditions including cancer [31,32], irritable bowel syndrome [33], Crohn’s disease [34,35], diabetes [36,37], obesity [38], and chronic pain [39]. Several studies examined the relationship between alpha diversity in the gut microbiome during immunotherapy in advanced melanoma [40,41], lung [16], and liver [42,43] cancers, and found that alpha diversity was associated with a positive response to immunotherapy, as measured by progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Notably, a recent breakthrough reported that alpha diversity of gut bacteria at baseline correlated with an improved recurrence of free survival (RFS) and OS, resulting in the proposal that alpha diversity has a potential use as an independent predictor of survival in cervical cancer patients receiving CRT [12]. Nonetheless, one study addressed the issue of current outcome prediction using measurements of diversity, which in most studies are measured based on species-level or operational taxonomic units (OUT)–level diversity [44]. Due to the lack of knowledge of the functional differences in multiple taxonomic levels of diversity, there is a need to assess and examine these in future studies.

In conclusion, the current review demonstrates that dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is related to GI toxicities induced by RT/CRT and that gut microbiome profiles can be used as predictors of GI toxicities prior to RT, thereby potentially reducing the incidence of cancer recurrence. However, before these findings can be recommended as standard screening tools, further robustly designed studies with appropriate effect size are warranted.
