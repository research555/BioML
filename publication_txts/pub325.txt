Individual Nutrition Is Associated with Altered Gut Microbiome Composition for Adults with Food Insecurity

Diet is widely recognized as a key contributor to human gut microbiome composition and function. However, overall nutrition can be difficult to compare across a population with varying diets. Moreover, the role of food security in the relationship with overall nutrition and the gut microbiome is unclear. This study aims to investigate the association between personalized nutrition scores, variation in the adult gut microbiome, and modification by food insecurity. The data originate from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Microbiome Study. Individual nutrition scores were assessed using My Nutrition Index (MNI), calculated using data from food frequency questionnaires, and additional health history and demographic surveys. Food security and covariate data were measured through self-reported questionnaires. The gut microbiome was assessed using 16S amplicon sequencing of DNA extracted from stool samples. Associations, adjusted for confounding and interaction by food security, were estimated using Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression models with Random Subset and Repeated Holdout extensions (WQSRSRH), with bacterial taxa used as components in the weighted index. Of 643 participants, the average MNI was 66.5 (SD = 31.9), and 22.8% of participants were food insecure. Increased MNI was significantly associated with altered gut microbial composition (β = 2.56, 95% CI = 0.52–4.61), with Ruminococcus, Oscillospira, and Blautia among the most heavily weighted of the 21 genera associated with the MNI score. In the stratified interaction WQSRSRH models, the bacterial taxa most heavily weighted in the association with MNI differed by food security, but the level of association between MNI and the gut microbiome was not significantly different. More bacterial genera are important in the association with higher nutrition scores for people with food insecurity versus food security, including Streptococcus, Parabacteroides Faecalibacterium, and Desulfovibrio. Individual nutrition scores are associated with differences in adult gut microbiome composition. The bacterial taxa most associated with nutrition vary by level of food security. While further investigation is needed, results showed a higher nutrition score was associated with a wider range of bacterial taxa for food insecure vs. secure, suggesting nutritional quality in food insecure individuals is important in maintaining health and reducing disparities.

The gut microbiome is increasingly being recognized as an important contributor to human health. The microbiome plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis of several key regulatory systems, including immune function and metabolism. An altered gut microbiome has been associated with a host of chronic conditions. Diet and exposure to antimicrobials are some of the best known modifiable factors to influence gut microbiome composition [1]. Opportunities for intervention via diet and microbiome have led to numerous investigations over the last decade. However, previous studies of diet and the gut microbiome primarily focus on specific dietary components (fiber [2], fat [3], etc.), or interventions using specific assigned diets (Mediterranean [4], etc.). Few studies have investigated the relationship between the overall nutrition of a person’s regular diet and composition of the gut microbiome and how social determinants such as poverty and food insecurity shape these relationships. Little is known about the relationship between food insecurity and the gut microbiome. Because food insecurity can affect the quality of food consumed [5], and influence biological processes related to stress [6,7], it is likely that food security would modify the effect of overall nutrition on the gut microbiome.

The aim of this study was to assess the association between personalized nutrition scores, using My Nutrition Index (MNI), and the composition of the gut microbiome in adults, using 16 s rRNA amplicon sequencing. We further investigated whether food security modifies the association between MNI and the gut microbiome. To address these aims, we used data from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) and the Wisconsin Microbiome Study (WMS). We applied Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression techniques to the microbiome data analysis to investigate associations with the gut microbiome as a mixture, applying a stratified interaction WQS model to microbiome data, which has not been done previously.

This analysis used existing data collected by the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW), and its ancillary Wisconsin Microbiome Study (WMS). Descriptions of both studies have been previously published [26,27,28]. In brief, SHOW is a population-based health examination survey and ongoing cohort study that collects a wide range of survey data, objective measurements, and biological specimens relating to health exposures and outcomes, from non-institutionalized residents of Wisconsin. In 2016–2017, WMS added the collection of survey data on microbial exposures and risk factors, and bio-specimens for microbiome analysis for all adult participants. WMS participants contributed one stool microbiome sample each, with the survey data taken cross-sectionally. Exclusion criteria included having incomplete data on the variables of interest found in Table 1, including the components that comprised our primary outcome, the My Nutrition Index. For this analysis, we used survey self-report data, and microbiome sequencing data from stool samples, from 643 participants with complete data.

The protocol for this analysis was approved by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Review Board (STUDY-20-01396, Approved 19 January 2021). SHOW guidelines for data sharing and publication have been followed.

The stool collection, DNA extraction, and sequencing data processing have been previously described in detail [27,29]. Briefly, stool samples were collected and refrigerated at home up to 24 h prior to a study visit. Samples were then shipped on ice from the study clinic to the lab within 24 h, where they were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted using chemical, heat, and mechanical lysis. DNA purification was performed with a phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction followed by a clean-up kit. DNA was quantified before PCR amplification of the 16 s rRNA V4 region. Custom barcoded PCR primers were used following the protocol by Kozich et al. [30]. Amplicon sequences were purified using a low-melt agarose gel electrophoresis, and further cleaned using a 96 well cleanup kit. Samples were quantified and pooled before sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq per manufacturer’s instructions. Raw sequencing data were processed in mothur v. 1.39 [30] following the MiSeq data Standard Operating Procedure [31]. Overlapping sequences were aligned using the SILVA v.132 16S rRNA reference database [32]. Low-quality reads and chimeras were removed using UCHIME [33]. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were assigned at the species level (97% similarity) using GreenGenes v. gg_13_8_99 [34]. OTU counts were rarified to 10,000 sequences per sample. Relative abundance was calculated for all OTUs with greater than 10% detect, and further ranked. We ranked the OTUs across subjects by setting zeros to a rank of 0, and deciling non-zero values.

The My Nutrition Index (MNI) is a validated index of the nutritional value of one’s daily diet derived from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) [35,36,37]. It comprises 34 dietary components: total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat, energy, protein, carbohydrates, alcohol, caffeine, sugar, fiber, vitamin E as alpha-tocopherol, vitamin C, cholesterol, potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron, phosphorus, zinc, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B5, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin K, manganese, chloride, folate, and selenium. The FFQ used to collect dietary nutrient values was the Diet History Questionnaire II for US & Canada, produced by the National Cancer Institute [38]. Usual diet over the previous year was queried using the FFQ, and responses were processed into nutrient values using the Diet*Calc software [39].

MNI is a metric of how close each component is to guideline values based on the characteristics of the subject (for example, body mass index, smoking status (yes/no), pregnancy, sex, age, and physical activity). It assigns higher scores for nutrient values that fall within the published dietary guidelines’ recommended concentration range, and lower scores if intake for a given nutrient deviates from this ideal range (above or below). MNI provides an overall index score ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting a more nutritious diet. Four subscales focus the assessment to nutritional categories: Vitamin Index, Mineral Index, Electrolyte Index, and Macro Nutrient Index. Each is on the same scale as the MNI. See the supplemental methods for further description of the subscales. Values for the MNI and subscales above roughly 90 indicate adequate nutrition on each scale. In preprocessing the nutrient data, extreme values (>99th percentile) of sodium and energy were removed from the analysis. The subscales were evaluated as dichotomized values due to skewed and uniform distributions. The Macro Index, Vitamin Index, and Mineral Index were split at a score of 90 due to skewness; the Electrolyte index (here, comprised of sodium and potassium) was split at the median due to a uniform distribution.

Due to the use of sex, age, BMI, smoking, and physical activity in the calculation of MNI, we excluded those variables as covariates or confounders in our analyses. Therefore, our only a priori confounder included self-reported antibiotic use in the past year (yes vs. no/missing). Additional covariates considered included education level, race, family income, and food security. Food insecurity was considered a confounder in stratified analyses, and as an effect modifier in interaction analyses. Food security status was determined by pooling responses to the following three questions: (1) In the last 12 months, did you ever get emergency food from a church, a food pantry, or a food bank, or eat in a soup kitchen? (2) In the last 12 months, have you been concerned about having enough food for you or your family? (3) In the last 12 months, were you authorized to receive Food Stamps, which includes a food stamp card or voucher, or cash grants from the state for food? If the subject responded yes to any of these questions, they were considered to be food insecure. Additional description of other covariate measurement is included in the Supplementary Materials.

Statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.0.4 R Core Team (2020), and SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). We analyzed the microbiome as a mixture in an association model with each nutritional index, our primary analysis being with MNI, and further stratified the analyses by food security level. The primary mixture method employed was weighted quantile sum regression (WQS) with random subsets (WQSRS) and repeated holdouts (WQSRH) extensions (WQSRSRH), with secondary analyses using stratified interaction WQSRSRH. Additional details about the model building approach have been included in the Supplementary Materials.

These various WQS methods output weighted indices that assign a weight to each individual OTU within the mixture. Were each distinct OTU to have an equal contribution to the association with the outcome, each OTU would have the same weight value. Assuming the OTUs do not have equal weight (equi-weight), we calculate a threshold of 1/c, c being equal to the total number of components in the mixture. If the OTUs are not equi-weighted, we are interested in the weights that are greater than the threshold because they have a greater impact on the positive association between the mixture and the MNI. Instead of assessing the weights at the OTU level, however, we summed the weights of the OTUs within each genus, for a genus-level weight. The threshold, then, became 1/89, since there were 89 genera.

Table 1 provides characteristics and demographics of the analytic sample from SHOW. The study sample (n = 643) consisted of adults (average age 57 years), who primarily identified as white (87%). The average body mass index (BMI) was obese, at 30.6. The majority of participants were female (57%) and had a high school degree or higher. The majority of participants (78%) were food secure (yes/no), and reported having never smoked (87%). In total, 60% of participants had not taken antibiotics in the year prior to providing their stool sample. The microbiome samples (1 per participant) had a total of 6645 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). After filtering the analysis to OTUs that were detected in 10% or more of the samples, there were 516 OTUs comprising 135 species, 89 genera, and 8 phyla. Covariates for the My Nutrition Index included race, food insecurity, and education status; the binary electrolyte index was associated with food insecurity and education. The macro index was associated with education. The mineral index was not associated with any covariates. The vitamin index was associated with antibiotic use in the past year. See Table S1 for further details.

We found a positive association between the microbiome mixture and the MNI (Table 2, Supplemental Results). The positive association suggested that for each non-zero decile increase in the WQS microbiome index, the MNI increased by 2.56 units (β = 2.56, CI = 0.52, 4.61). This indicates that, when there is a 1 out of 10 increase in the WQS index, due to a combination of (a) higher rank of one or more OTU, indicating greater exposure, and/or (b) exposure to OTUs that are weighted more highly in a positive association to the MNI, the MNI is increased (100 = top health, 0 is lowest health).

In total, 21/89 genera had sums above the genera-specific threshold from the repeated holdout. Moreover, 15 of the 21 genera were within the Firmicutes phylum, with unclassified Lachnospiraceae as the genera weight with the highest summed weight, and unclassified Ruminococcaceae as the second highest summed weight. The phyla Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobiota also ranked highly from this analysis (see Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). To view the magnitude of the weights, see Supplementary Figure S2.

We found a positive association between the microbiome WQS mixture and the binary electrolyte index, which suggested that for each decile increase in the WQSRS microbiome index, there was a 58% increase in the odds of having an above median electrolyte index score versus a below-median score (OR = 1.58, CI = 1.24, 2.02) (Table 2).

In total, 17/89 genera had sums above the genera-specific threshold from the repeated holdout. Moreover, 14 of the 17 genera were within the Firmicutes phylum, with unclassified Lachnospiraceae as the genera weight with the highest summed weight, and unclassified Ruminococcaceae as the second highest summed weight (similar to the MNI analysis). The phyla Proteobacteria and unclassified Bacteria also ranked highly from this analysis (see Figure 1 and Supplementary Figures S1 and S3).

We found a significant positive association between the WQS microbiome index and the MNI when stratified by food security status and adjusted for covariates (β = 7.7, CI = 1.32, 14.1) (Table 3). In the stratified analysis, the difference in strata is calculated in the estimation of the weights; therefore, the interpretation remains the same for both food secure and insecure groups: there is a positive association between the gut microbiome and the MNI. However, the OTUs that contribute to the positive association differ between the food secure vs insecure groups. See Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S4 for the stratified weights above the stratum-and-genera-level threshold. Instead of reporting within strata the OTU weights categorized by the genera, we summed the weights of OTUs within strata and genera. We then calculated the stratum-specific threshold to compare genera that were shown to have greater influence on the mixture than if each genera had an equal weight. With 39 genera total and 2 strata, 1/78 was the threshold value in this analysis. We found 25 genera to be above the threshold, all of which were identified in the food insecure group as highly weighted genera, while 12 of these 25 were also identified as highly weighted in the food secure group (see Figure 1, Supplementary Figures S1 and S4).

There was no significant association with an interaction between food security status and the WQS index on the MNI, with or without stratification by food security status (see Supplementary Table S2).

We found a significant positive association between the WQS microbiome index and the electrolyte index when stratified by food security status and adjusted for covariates (β = 2.86, CI = 1.53, 5.37) (Table 3). There is a positive association between the gut microbiome and the electrolyte index; however, the OTUs that contribute to the positive association differ between the food secure vs insecure groups. See Figure 1 and Supplementary Figures S1 and S5 for the stratified weights above the stratum-and-genera-level threshold. We found 26 genera to be above the threshold, all of which were identified as highly weighted in the food insecure group, while only 14 of these 26 were also identified in the food secure group.

The highest weights within this analysis were the unclassified Lachnospiraceae and the unclassified Ruminococcaceae, for both the food secure and insecure groups. Similar to the MNI analysis, the weights for these taxa were higher in the food insecure group than in the food secure group. Genera whose summed weights were above the genera-and-stratum-specific weights and that were exclusively above the threshold in the food insecure group included Peptoniphilus, Coprabacillus, Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, Anaerostipes, Ruminococcus, Faecalibacterium, Desulfovibrio, Akkermansia, and Streptococcus. No significant interactions with food security were seen in any of the subscale analyses (see Supplementary Table S3).

This analysis is among the first to consider total dietary quality measured by personalized nutrition scores (MNI) and specific indices on gut microbial composition, and uses a novel approach to microbiome analysis with stratified weighted quantile sum regression. The application of this WQS approach to account for the mixtures of both dietary components and gut microbial composition acknowledges the complexity of both dietary as well as gut microbial composition and overcomes limitations of previous analyses of diet and gut microbiome. This analysis also extended the application of WQS to microbiome data, as it is the first analysis to apply the stratified interaction WQS extension to microbiome data.

In conclusion, individual nutrition scores are associated with the adult gut microbiome, and the bacterial taxa most associated with nutrition vary by level of food security. Results may suggest that better nutrition is more important in shaping the gut microbiome for people who are food insecure, because nutrition was associated with a wider range of bacterial taxa for food insecure vs. secure individuals. However, additional research is needed.
