Whole Blueberry and Isolated Polyphenol-Rich Fractions Modulate Specific Gut Microbes in an In Vitro Colon Model and in a Pilot Study in Human Consumers

Blueberry (BB) consumption is linked to improved health. The bioconversion of the polyphenolic content of BB by fermentative bacteria in the large intestine may be a necessary step for the health benefits attributed to BB consumption. The identification of specific gut microbiota taxa that respond to BB consumption and that mediate the bioconversion of consumed polyphenolic compounds into bioactive forms is required to improve our understanding of how polyphenols impact human health. We tested the ability of polyphenol-rich fractions purified from whole BB—namely, anthocyanins/flavonol glycosides (ANTH/FLAV), proanthocyanidins (PACs), the sugar/acid fraction (S/A), and total polyphenols (TPP)—to modulate the fecal microbiota composition of healthy adults in an in vitro colon system. In a parallel pilot study, we tested the effect of consuming 38 g of freeze-dried BB powder per day for 6 weeks on the fecal microbiota of 17 women in two age groups (i.e., young and older). The BB ingredients had a distinct effect on the fecal microbiota composition in the artificial colon model. The ANTH/FLAV and PAC fractions were more effective in promoting microbiome alpha diversity compared to S/A and TPP, and these effects were attributed to differentially responsive taxa. Dietary enrichment with BB resulted in a moderate increase in the diversity of the microbiota of the older subjects but not in younger subjects, and certain health-relevant taxa were significantly associated with BB consumption. Alterations in the abundance of some gut bacteria correlated not only with BB consumption but also with increased antioxidant activity in blood. Collectively, these pilot data support the notion that BB consumption is associated with gut microbiota changes and health benefits.

The gut microbiota is a recognized modulator of human health and is shaped by host genetics, environment, lifestyle, and diet [1,2]. Most studies investigated cohorts representing western populations and lifestyle and compared healthy subjects and individuals with diverse conditions. Despite significant inter-individual variations in the gut microbiota composition, a general description of the healthy adult gut microbiota has emerged [3], but the variation range of phylum proportional abundances in healthy subjects is still large. Factors working throughout the lifespan such as repeated antibiotic use, significant changes in dietary habits, and infections may lead to perturbations and reductions in the composition and phylogenetic diversity of the gut microbiota that are associated with disease [4].

To further elucidate the interactions between BB ingredients and the human gut microbiome, we profiled the compositional changes that occurred in batch fermentations inoculated with the fecal microbiota of healthy young adults and supplemented with isolated BB polyphenol-rich fractions. These fractions are individually enriched for different major classes of presumptive bioactive BB ingredients, and have been tested for their activity in multiple previous publications [33,34,35,36,37]. To detect microbiota taxa that are responsive to human BB consumption, 17 healthy female volunteers in two age groups consumed freeze-dried BB for 6 weeks, and their gut microbiota composition was analyzed before and after the dietary intervention. The data indicate that BB ingredients or whole BB fruit can affect the microbiota both in in vitro colon model systems and in human consumers, but the effects on microbiota diversity are greater in older consumers.

A pool of 5 fecal microbiota samples was used to inoculate the fermenter vessels comprising an artificial colon model. The five fecal samples were collected from healthy young donors (coded as follows: HYD3 32 years old (yrs), HA4 26 yrs, HA6 29 yrs, HA7 29 yrs, HA8 35 yrs) under a procedure approved by the local clinical research ethics committee. All the subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board at Cornell University (Protocol ID#: 1706007263).

The MIX medium was supplemented separately with each of 4 different BB polyphenol fractions: i. anthocyanins/flavonol glycosides (200 mg/L); ii. proanthocyanidins (200 mg/L); iii. sugar/acid fraction; and iv. total polyphenolics (333 mg/L). These were prepared as described in Section 2.4. A fermentation run without any supplementation was performed as a control. Samples from the fermentation culture were retrieved at 0, 16, and 24 h and centrifuged immediately, and the pellet and supernatants were kept at −20 °C for further analysis.

A 200 mg quantity of fecal pellet was weighed as instructed in the QIamp Fast DNA Stool (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) extraction kit protocol. The samples were homogenized mechanically in sterile tubes containing InhibitEX solution and zirconia glass beads of three sizes—0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mm (Thistle Scientific Ltd., Glasgow, UK)—using a Mini-Beadbeader (Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA). The subsequent steps of gDNA extraction were performed as previously described by our laboratory [39].

The primers S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17 (5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′)/S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21 (5′GACTACHVGGGTATC TAATC C-3′) 5′ [42] were used to amplify the V3/V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene for the profiling of the bacterial fecal microbiota using the Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). After PCR product purification, the Illumina MiSeq system protocol was used for library preparation. Indexing PCR was performed to amply the dual-index barcodes to the amplicon (Nextera XT V.2 Index Kits; Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The purification of the barcoded amplicons was performed with the Agencourt AMPure XP-PCR Purification system (Beckman Coutler, Inc., Brea, CA, USA). The Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to quantify the products. Equal concentrations of all the purified amplicons were pooled into a library that was sequenced (2 × 300 bp) on a MiSeq Illumina platform in the Teagasc Food Research Centre sequencing facility (Teagasc Moorepark, Fermoy, Ireland). ENA accession number: PRJEB39031.

Four major ingredient fractions of BB were prepared essentially as previously described in several previous publications [32,33,34,35,36,37]. In detail, whole frozen BB, cv. “Coville”, were extracted, and fractions of total polyphenolics (TPP), proanthocyanidins (PACs), anthocyanin/flavonol glycosides (ANTH/FLAV), and sugars/acids (S/A) were isolated using solid-phase chromatography according to Howell et al., 2005 [43]. Briefly, BBs were homogenized with water in a blender and applied to a C18 column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) preconditioned with MeOH followed by dH2O. The S/A fraction was collected as the column was washed with dH2O then dH2O:MeOH (85:15) (v/v), followed by elution with acidified aqueous methanol. Solvents were removed from the S/A fraction under reduced pressure. The TPP fraction containing anthocyanins, flavonol glycosides, and PACs (confirmed using reverse-phase HPLC with diode array detection) was eluted with 1% HOAc in MeOH (v/v). All the fractions were dried under reduced pressure to remove the solvent. The TPP fraction was then suspended in 50% EtOH, and applied to a Sephadex™ LH-20 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) column that was pre-equilibrated overnight in EtOH:dH2O (50:50) (v/v). The ANTH/FLAV fraction was eluted with 50% EtOH and dried to remove the solvent. The PAC fraction was eluted from the LH-20 column with 70% aqueous acetone, and monitored for purity using diode array detection at 280 nm. The absence of absorption at 360 nm and 450 nm confirmed that flavonol glycosides and anthocyanins, respectively, were removed. Acetone was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the resulting purified PAC fraction was dried. Analytical tools, including mass spectrometry and NMR spectrometry, have been routinely utilized to confirm the composition of these BB fractions using the method of Schmidt et al. (2004) and others [44,45,46].

This study was approved by the Cornell University institutional review board and complies with the Helsinki Declaration. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04262258). All the participants provided written informed consent prior to participation in the study.

The participants BED_001, 002, 003, 006, 007, 008, 009, 011, 013, 015, and 016 belonged to the young age group and the participants BED_004, 005, 010, 014, 018, and 020 belonged to the older age group (Table 1).

All values are presented as means ± standard error. BMI: body mass index; CRP: C-reactive protein. a One outlier value excluded.

The ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was determined in plasma from the BED donors following established methods [47]. Briefly, a solution of sodium acetate (EMDMillipore, Burlington, MA, USA), 2,4,6 tripyridyl-S-triazine (TPTZ, ACROS Organics, Geel, Belgium), and ferric chloride (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was incubated with plasma samples or ferrous sulfate (assay standard, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 4 min at 37 °C. The absorbance was measured at 593 nm and standardized to the absorbance of the ferrous sulfate standard to derive the FRAP value (μmol/L). Four technical replicates were measured. The absorbance of the blank was subtracted from each measurement, and the FRAP value of each sample was determined using the following formula: (sample absorbance)/(assay standard absorbance) * (assay standard concentration (1000 μmol/L)).

Routine panels were conducted on stored fasting plasma samples (glucose and C-reactive protein) at Cornell University’s Human Nutritional Chemistry Service Laboratory. Glucose was analyzed on a Dimension Xpand chemistry analyzer (Siemens Healthineers, Malvern, PA, USA), and CRP was measured on an Immulite 2000 immunoassay system (Siemens Healthineers, Malvern, PA, USA).

The pipeline for the microbiota composition analysis was described before [48] and comprised the following steps. Paired-end reads were joined with FLASH [49] and quality filtering was performed in Qiime (v.1.9.1) using the split_libraries_fastq.py script [50]. The forward and reverse primers were removed using cutadapt [51] and the script truncate_reverse_primer.py, respectively. For additional quality filtering and de novo operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering, USEARCH was used. Filtering by length and size was performed before single unique sequences were excluded. Clustering in OTUs was performed using 97% identity for the sequences after the various filtering steps. Chimeras were removed based on the use of UCHIME with the GOLD reference database. The OTUs were used to map sequences initially filtered for quality (97% identity). The mothur suite of tools (v1.36.1) and the RDP (trainset 14) were used for the OTU classification (classify.seqs) with a 80% confidence threshold [52]. The OTUs were classified down to the species level with SPINGO [53].

For the FRAP values, the associations were further validated using Random Forest models (using the combination of the rfcv and randomForest functions of the randomForest module of R v 3.5.4). A total of 100 iterations of the Random Forest models were performed, each time taking 50% of the samples for training and testing on the other 50%. For each sample, the mean predicted FRAP values were then correlated with the actual FRAP values to ascertain the strength of the association. A key advantage of the Random Forest models is that they can not only be used to predict a given trait (either quantitative or categorical; in this case, the quantitative FRAP values) from a dataset of multiple predictor features (in this case, the OTUs), but they can provide the relative importance of each of the features to predict the given trait. This enables the identification of the most optimal set of associated features for predicting a given trait. Using these scores, the core list of FRAP-positive and FRAP-negative marker OTUs was identified, as described in detail in the Results section. The enrichment of the different CAGs in the two FRAP-associated marker OTUs was observed using Fishers’ exact test. Spearman correlations (and the associated p values) were computed using the corr.test function of the psych package of the R programming interface (run with the adjust = “fdr” argument for p value correction-false discovery rate FDR). The volcano plots showing the positive and negative associations of the various taxa with the clinical metadata were using the ggplot and ggrepel modules of R v 3.5.4.

The fecal microbiota α diversity (Shannon and Observed Species) was reduced over the 24 h of fermentation (observed at the 16 h and 24 h time points) compared to the baseline 0 h (Supplementary Materials Figure S1), which is a typical feature of in vitro colon models [43]. Supplementation with ANTH/FLAV, PACs, and prebiotic MIX resulted in microbiota communities displaying similar Shannon and Observed Species diversity index values that were noticeably higher than in the fermentations with either S/A and TPP supplementation (significant for PACs/MIX versus S/A with padj < 0.5) (Figure 1a; Figure S2). Thus, in the in vitro colon model used in this study, isolated BB components such as the polyphenol-rich fractions ANTH/FLAV and PACs were more efficient in promoting microbiota diversity than the other polyphenol-rich fractions used in this study—i.e., TPP or the S/A fraction.

Apart from the aforementioned supplementation effects on the dominant taxa, the low abundance taxa (<1% average relative abundance) were also differentially abundant in the microbiota depending on the supplementation of the fermentation medium (Figure S5). Supplementation with ANTH/FLAV resulted in an increased relative abundance of Phascolarctobacterium compared to MIX (significant; padj < 0.05), S/A (marginal; padj < 0.1) and TPP (significant; padj < 0.05) supplementation, and of Gemmiger compared to MIX and PACs (padj < 0.05 for both supplementations). The Clostridium cluster XIVb relative abundance was increased with PACs supplementation (padj < 0.05 compared to ANTH/FLAV, S/A, and TPP). The Sutterella relative abundance was increased upon ANTH/FLAV supplementation (padj < 0.05 compared to S/A and TPP). The Oscillibacter and Flavonifractor relative abundance was significantly increased with MIX and PACs supplementation, whereas the Burkholderiales relative abundance was highest after the PAC supplementation (significantly higher: padj < 0.05 compared to TPP; marginally higher: padj < 0.1 as compared to ANTH/FLAV) (Figure S5). The unclassified Erysipelotrichaceae had the lowest relative abundance after S/A supplementation, whereas Parasuterella had the lowest relative abundance after the ANTH/FLAV and TPP supplementation (Figure S5).

The α diversity of the fecal microbiota in the human trial subjects did not show significant difference across time points for any of the α diversity indices measured (Shannon, Simpson, Chao1, PD, and Observed Species) (Figure S6). The lower sample size, especially of the group of older women, reduced the statistical power of the comparisons. However, investigating the time point-specific distributions of the diversity measures separately for the young and the older women indicated that, for the older group, for most of the measures (with the exception of Shannon) the α diversities at time points W4 and W6 were observed to be similar and higher than that at the pre-intervention W0 time point, indicating an increasing albeit non-significant trend for the elderly (Figure S6). We then investigated this further to check if any differences in the microbiota α diversity were observed by comparing the pre (W0) and post (W4 and W6) intervention time points on a per-individual basis (separately for each age group) (Figure S7a). In the fecal microbiota of five out of six older subjects, the Shannon diversity was increased during the intervention (mean of W4 and W6 aggregated) from the baseline W1 (Figure S7a). Similar results were not observed for the young subjects (Figure S7b).

Based on β diversity, the fecal microbiota of the older subjects formed a distinct cluster at W4, albeit with high intra-sample variation (Figure S8a). Given the lower sample size and high intra-sample variability, the trends were not significant (PERMANOVA R2 = 0.03). The fecal microbiota of the younger women showed no β diversity shifts throughout the intervention (PERMANOVA R2 = 0.002) (Figure S8b).

The C1, C3, and C6 CAGs’ cumulated abundances increased significantly with BB consumption (at W4 and W6). C1 increased from W0 to W4 and decreased at W6, whereas C3 and C6 progressively increased from W0 to W6 (Figure 3b). Several health-relevant species were abundant in these CAGs—e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Barnesiella intestinihominis, Eubacterium halii, Anaerostipes hadrus, and Ruminococcus bromii (Figure 3d). These results indicate the putative beneficial effect of BB consumption on the gut microbiota.

The levels of plasma CRP, glucose, and FRAP assay measures were collected at W0 and W6 for 10 young and 5 old women. Using PERMANOVA analysis, the association of the gut microbiota at both OTU and CAG level with CRP, glucose, and FRAP was investigated (Table 2). No association between the gut microbiota composition with either the CRP or glucose levels was observed. However, the FRAP assay measures showed significant association with the gut microbiota at both the OTU and CAG level (Table 2).

Interestingly, the across-time point changes in FRAP assay measures showed negative associations with the corresponding changes in the plasma glucose levels (Spearman Rho = −0.46; p < 0.05) (Figure S10d). A similar negative association was also observed between the FRAP positive-markers and the plasma glucose levels. Thus, these results overall seem to suggest a step-wise association between BB consumption and plasma glucose levels, wherein the consumption of BBs is associated with the enrichment of specific taxonomic groups, and a subset is positively associated with circulating antioxidant activity, which in turn is negatively associated with the plasma glucose levels. The associations of these OTUs with FRAP were both sample-specific and distinct for time points.

We have previously reported the reduction in the fecal microbiota α diversity due to the loss of fastidious taxa while the microbiota is adapting to the in vitro conditions of the artificial colon model [39,56]. To retain much of the stool diversity throughout the fermentation period, the basal fermentation medium was supplemented with a mix of indigestible and prebiotic carbohydrates often used in continuous in vitro systems [57]. Importantly, the supplementation of the fermentation medium with the polyphenol-rich fractions ANTH/FLAV, PACs, or prebiotic MIX substrates resulted in a favorable (i.e., health-associated) microbiota profile. Although the content of these fractions was not yet investigated by chromatographic separation, the fractions tested were prepared in the same way as in multiple previous publications, and so they are directly comparable in terms of evaluating their bioactive properties. The α diversity and the abundance of the major microbiota families Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroidaceae were comparatively higher, whereas the Enterobacteriaceae relative abundance was lower compared to TPP and S/A supplementation. The sugar content of the S/A fractions and potential residual sugars in the TPP fraction, which would be expected to be absorbed in the small intestine in humans, may have resulted in the significantly increased relative abundance of these organisms that are potent utilizers of simple sugars [58]. Apart from this explanation, Enterobacteriaceae have been reported to be involved in the metabolism of polyphenols in the gut [27,59]. Importantly, not all Enterobacteriaceae are harmful, with some playing an important role in the “healthy” gut microbiota [9].

Here, we report taxa that not only were associated with BB consumption forming distinct CAGs (i.e., E. hallii, B. intestinihominis, A. hadrus, F.prausnitzii) as discussed, but that taxa that mostly belong to the significant CAGs were associated with improved FRAP measurements. In this part of the analysis, we found that E. siraeum (Clostridium cluster IV Ruminococcaceae taxon) and the phylogenetically close F. prausnitzii and G. formicilis [70] were positively associated with FRAP. Interestingly, in humans serum markers of insulin resistance were associated with reduced E. siraeum and Butyrivibrio crossotus abundance [93]. Conversely, G. formicilis and C. catus, identified in this study to be positively associated with FRAP, were associated with obesity [94,95,96,97].

In vitro conditions place constraints on microbiota responsiveness to supplementation tests [98]. Notwithstanding this, the investigational studies as presented here offer a straightforward experimental model to test the initial hypothesis and provide insight into informed in vivo study design [99]. In future studies, the potential of the in vitro-identified microbiota response to BB polyphenol-rich fractions can be extended to the development of next-generation symbiotics.

The human study contributed evidence for specific microbiota modulation due to BB consumption in correlation with antioxidant activity in healthy adults. The association of fibrolytic taxa with whole BB consumption may indicate that the BB can contribute to health by both its polyphenolic content and its fibre content that, in effect, may render the fibre-bound polyphenols more accessible to microbiota fermentation [100]. In the context of healthy ageing, BB consumption may increase colonic short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production through fiber contribution to the fibrolytic members of the microbiota and promote health [101]. Importantly, non-pathobionts in the “healthy” microbiota, such as the taxa C. catus or A. hadrus mentioned in our study, may play a variant role within a different health context and in response to external dietary stimuli [102,103]. Strain-level identification is important in order to explain why individuals may respond differently to microbiota modulation [101,104]. Interindividual variation can be of relevance in the way dietary polyphenols impact health, given the fact that their bioavailability largely depends on the gut microbiota enzymatic armor [105]. Future large-scale clinical studies including both women and men and examining the metabolic impact of BB consumption in correlation with microbiota changes, inflammatory markers, and gender will allow for a deeper understanding of the role of BB consumption in human health. At the same time, a detailed chromatographic analysis of the BB fractions described here is desirable to generate greater granularity and detail on what individual compounds are present in each starting fraction, and what they are metabolized into, in the context of the microbiome changes described already in this report.
