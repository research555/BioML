Dysfunctional Gut Microbiome Networks in Childhood IgE-Mediated Food Allergy

The development of food allergy has been reported to be related with the changes in the gut microbiome, however the specific microbe associated with the pathogenesis of food allergy remains elusive. This study aimed to comprehensively characterize the gut microbiome and identify individual or group gut microbes relating to food-allergy using 16S rRNA gene sequencing with network analysis. Faecal samples were collected from children with IgE-mediated food allergies (n = 33) and without food allergy (n = 27). Gut microbiome was profiled by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. OTUs obtained from 16S rRNA gene sequencing were then used to construct a co-abundance network using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and mapped onto Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. We identified a co-abundance network module to be positively correlated with IgE-mediated food allergy and this module was characterized by a hub taxon, namely Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 (phylum Firmicutes). Functional pathway analysis of all the gut microbiome showed enrichment of methane metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism in the gut microbiome of food-allergic children and enrichment of ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis in the gut microbiome of non-food allergic children. We concluded that Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 may play determinant roles in gut microbial community structure and function leading to the development of IgE-mediated food allergy.

Emerging evidence has pointed towards the critical role of microbial communities in human health and disease, including regulation of the mucosal barrier function [1,2,3,4], metabolism [5,6,7] and host immune responses [3,4,8]. This is particularly evident in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where the diversity and richness of microorganisms are highest [9]. Changes in the gut microbiome commonly referred to as dysbiosis, may disrupt gut homeostasis and increase intestinal permeability, thereby causing immune system disorders such as autoimmune diseases and allergic disorders including food allergy [10,11,12].

Considering the complexity of structure, function and compositional variability, the gut microbiome can be modelled and expressed as networks to infer the dynamic nature of the host–microbe interactions [16]. One approach to construct co-abundance network modules is to apply weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to quantify the co-abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across multiple samples. Developed by Horvath and colleagues, WGCNA was initially used to construct gene networks based on their similar biological functions and identify the hub gene that may associated with phenotypic traits [17]. We used WGCNA in this study to analyse the association between gut microbiome and disease phenotype by forming the complex microbial communities into different co-abundance network modules in order to identify hub taxa, the centralities of these co-abundance modules. Through this, we expect that WGCNA will identify potential target microbes, which may play a key role in regulating/influencing the microbe–microbe interactions, leading to the onset of food allergy.

A total of 60 samples were included in our final analysis (33 food-allergic children and 27 non-food allergic children). Thirty-nine percent of the subjects were boys, with the median age for non-food allergic children and food-allergic children of 5.9 years and 5.0 years, respectively. The groups did not significantly differ from each other with regard to age (p = 0.200) and gender (p = 0.525). The food allergies noted in the food-allergic children included nuts (n = 23), egg (n = 4) and mixed allergies (n = 6).

To determine the average species diversity in a habitat or specific area, alpha diversity was evaluated using Chao1, Shannon index and observed OTUs matrices. Chao1 showed that non-food allergic children had lower species richness compared to food-allergic children, while Shannon index and observed OTUs showed that non-food allergic children and food-allergic children had similar gut microbial community richness and evenness (Table 1).

Bold value indicates a statistically significant difference with a p-value less than 0.05.

To determine the degree of inter-group dissimilarity, beta diversity was evaluated using unweighted and weighted UniFrac distance matrices. Beta diversity did not show a significant difference between food-allergic children and non-food allergic children (Supplementary Figure S1).

OTU dataset for food-allergic children and non-food allergic children consisted of 7 phyla, 14 classes, 16 orders, 28 families and 105 genera. At the phyla level, the gut microbiota was dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with lower abundance of Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Tenericutes and Cyanobacteria (Supplementary Figure S2) in children with and without food allergy. There was no significant difference in the phylum level between food-allergic children and non-food allergic children (Supplementary Table S1, Online Supplemental Notes).

One hundred and five genera were identified, and only 18 genera were accounted for more than 1% across all samples (Supplementary Table S2, Online Supplemental Notes). There was no significant difference in the genera level between food-allergic children and non-food allergic children.

To better characterize gut microbial taxa in food-allergic children, we applied WGCNA to identify clusters of microbial taxa whose differential representation was correlated with food allergy. Each cluster was represented as a colour module.

Through WGCNA, we were able to identify 14 modules of co-abundant taxa and the number of taxa within modules ranged from 32 to 167 (Table 2). Among all the taxa, only 167 taxa (17%) were not included in any colour module, and these taxa were grouped into the grey module as per default.

The module eigengenes between children with and without food allergy were further compared with using module trait association analysis to identify the food allergy-associated modules.

Our results showed that a co-abundance network module (turquoise) was positively correlated with food allergy (r = 0.27 p = 0.04) (Figure 1). Particularly, Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 was identified as the hub taxon (TaxaSignificance > 0.2 and Module Membership > 0.8) (Figure 2) for this module. In addition, 10 dominant taxa (>1% relative abundance across all samples) were also identified in the module. The majority of the dominant taxa came from Firmicutes phylum, including the genera of Ruminococcaceae UCG-002, Eubacterium oxidoreducens group, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group and Lachnospiraceae (NK4A136 and UCG-008). Other than this, the dominant taxa also included genera taxa from the phyla of Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides, Alistipes, Parabacteroides and Prevotella 2) as well as Proteobacteria (Rhodospirillaceae).

In order to have a better understanding of the functional pathway of gut microbial taxa that are associated with food allergy, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was performed by using the Tax4fun output. Using the threshold values (LDA > 2.0, p < 0.05), LEfSe revealed distinct KEGG pathway differences between gut microbiota of food-allergic children and non-food allergic children (Figure 3). Specifically, methane metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism were found to be enriched in food-allergic children. In contrast, ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis, as well as Vibrio cholerae pathogenic cycle were found to be enriched in non-food allergic children.

There is increasing evidence that alterations in the gut microbiome are related to the development of food allergy [13,14,15,18], although the specific microbe associated with the pathogenesis of food allergy remains elusive. Our objective for this study was to perform 16S rRNA gene sequencing in integration with network analysis to characterize the gut microbiome and identify individual gut microbes or network modules of them that differ between food-allergic children and non-food allergic children. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the gut microbiome of food-allergic children by applying network analysis.

Taken together, we speculate that increased abundance of Ruminococcaceae along with other dominant microbial taxa, may remodel the normal gut microbial ecosystem into a state of dysbiosis through the pathways of methane metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism, which in turn elicit a host IgE-mediated allergic response. Our findings highlight the usefulness of network analysis in disentangling the hub taxon, Ruminococcaceae that play determinant roles in gut microbial community structure and functions leading to IgE-mediated food allergy. The differences in the co-abundance patterns of gut microbiome between children with and without food allergy can help us understand the complex interrelationships between gut microbiome and pathogenesis of food allergies. This information potentially aids targeted dietary or probiotic strategies for clinical practice to improve food allergy outcomes. Although our study revealed there was an association between gut microbiome network and development of food allergy, there were several limitations in the study. Firstly, the sample size was small. However, the application of network analysis in our study has deciphered key microbial populations that may be associated with food allergy, including those with low relative abundance but highly relevant to the onset of food allergy through characterizing the interactions of microbes at the community scale. Secondly, 16S rRNA gene sequencing is only sensitive to the genus level, but not species and strains. Thirdly, as this was a cross-sectional study, our results could not indicate a causal relationship between the gut microbiome and food allergy. Finally, as our study aimed to construct a microbial network through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and weighted correlation network analysis, the actual roles of these taxa predicted to be related to food allergy have not yet been evaluated. Therefore, further studies utilizing metagenomic analysis or real-time PCR in larger cohorts are required to confirm our results.

From January 2018 to March 2019, children with immunologist-diagnosed food allergy, were recruited from Immunology Outpatient Clinic, Perth Children’s Hospital. Children from 1 year old to 7 years of age with immunologist-diagnosed food allergy were eligible for participation. Non-food allergic children, with age and gender matched were recruited from the local community.

All parents of the subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research, and the protocol was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC), Perth Children’s Hospital (RGS151/HREC 2017060EP) and Curtin University (HRE2017-0712).

Parents/guardians of the participants were provided a faecal collection kit, which included a protocol of faecal collection, a screw cap faecal container (Sarstedt, Germany), an underpad sheet, a pair of disposable gloves, a white paper bag and a sealed plastic bag with labels. Once collected, the faecal sample would then be transported on ice by a researcher within 2 hours of collection to the laboratory −80 °C freezers for storage.

DNA was then extracted using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR amplication and sequencing of sixty stool samples were performed by Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Briefly, PCR was carried out using Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix and GC Buffer (New England Biolabs, Beijing, China) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instruction. PCR thermal cycling was set as follows: initial denaturation at 98 °C for 1min, followed by 35 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 90 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The samples were then subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel for detection. Samples with a bright main strip between 400 and 450 bp were chosen for further analysis. The PCR products were purified using the Gene JET Gel Extraction kit (Thermo Scientific), and the sequencing libraries were constructed using Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instruction. The library quality was monitored using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, St. Louis, MO, USA) and a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Lastly, the library, which targeted the V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced on the Ion S5 XL platform (Thermo Fisher). A total of 4,858,507 sequences reads that passed the quality check (>Q20, error rate < 1%) were generated.

The raw sequences were then demultiplexed and quality filtered using QIIME [31] by removing those raw sequences with read-quality score less than 19, setting length fall below 3bp and consecutive quality base below 75%. The filtered sequences were then screened for chimeras using the usearch61 algorithm [32] and putative chimeric sequences were removed from the dataset. Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% similarity level against the SILVA reference database (release 128) [33]. The OTUs with low relative abundance (less than 0.005%) were removed. All further analyses were performed at a rarefied depth of 22,178 sequences per sample to correct for differences in the read depth across samples. Alpha diversity and beta diversity of microbial communities were analysed using QIIME. Alpha diversity was estimated using two different indices: (1) Chao1, which takes into accounts only the abundance; (2) observed OTUs, which takes into accounts only the observed species; (3) the Shannon index, which takes into accounts the abundance and evenness of OTUs. Beta diversity was measured using the weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance matrices. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) was obtained to visualise unweighted and weighted Unifrac distances in a two-dimensional structure. The Adonis permutational multivariate analysis (Adonis/PERMANOVA) was performed to compare beta diversity dissimilarity matrices. A comparison of the relative abundance of OTUs between groups was computed using the Mann–Whitney test. A probability value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

In order to have a better understanding of the co-abundance network of the microbial taxa, Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) package of R [17] was then performed to conduct network analysis by using OTU count data (with 97% identity threshold), which has undergone Hellinger transformation, by transforming OTU count data from absolute to relative abundance that gives low weights to variables with low counts and many zeros [34].

After that, module trait association analysis was used to calculate the correlation coefficient between modules and food allergy as well as demographics traits such as age and gender. Modules with p values < 0.05 were regarded significant food allergy-related modules.

Next, an intramodular analysis was performed to determine the hub taxa by summing the connection strengths with other module taxa. Moreover, the hub taxa have to meet the absolute value of the TaxaSignificance > 0.2 and Module Membership > 0.8. Taxa of the significant modules were then visualized using Cytoscape v3.8.0 [35].

All OTUs table and OTUs taxonomy were mapped onto Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways using R package, Tax4Fun. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis (http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/lefse/ (accessed on 18 February 2021)) was performed to detect biomarkers of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways that differed significantly between non-food allergic children and food-allergic children. Default settings (alpha = 0.05, effect-size threshold of 2) were applied.

Our study provides a better understanding of the gut microbiome with respect to the presence of Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 interacting with other dominant taxa including Eubacterium oxidoreducens group, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group, Lachnospiraceae (NK4A136 and UCG-008), Bacteroides, Alistipes, Parabacteroides, Prevotella 2 as well as Rhodospirillaceae in the pathogenesis of IgE-mediated food allergy and these microbial taxa were mainly involved in methane metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism. Integrative view of gut microbial ecology based on the microbial module in our study may help to understand the microbial interactions associated with IgE-mediated food allergy.
