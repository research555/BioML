Effects of Allium hookeri on gut microbiome related to growth performance in young broiler chickens

Healthy food promotes beneficial bacteria in the gut microbiome. A few prebiotics act as food supplements to increase fermentation by beneficial bacteria, which enhance the host immune system and health. Allium hookeri is a healthy food with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. A. hookeri is used as a feed supplement for broiler chickens to improve growth performance. Although the underlying mechanism is unknown, A. hookeri may alter the gut microbiome. In the current study, 16S rRNA sequencing has been carried out using samples obtained from the cecum of broiler chickens exposed to diets comprising different tissue types (leaf and root) and varying amounts (0.3% and 0.5%) of A. hookeri to investigate their impact on gut microbiome. The microbiome composition in the groups supplemented with A. hookeri leaf varied from that of the control group. Especially, exposure to 0.5% amounts of leaf resulted in differences in the abundance of genera compared with diets comprising 0.3% leaf. Exposure to a diet containing 0.5% A. hookeri leaf decreased the abundance of the following bacteria: Eubacterium nodatum, Marvinbryantia, Oscillospira, and Gelria. The modulation of gut microbiome by leaf supplement correlated with growth traits including body weight, bone strength, and infectious bursal disease antibody. The results demonstrate that A. hookeri may improve the health benefits of broiler chickens by altering the gut microbiome.

Diet plays an important role in modulating gut microbiome by providing food substrates for gut microorganisms [1,2]. Dietary components not digestible by host enzymes can be digested by gut bacteria [3]. For example, prebiotics such as inulin, polyphenol, and galacto-oligosaccharide are non-digestible food ingredients that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria [4]. Such prebiotics increase the fermentation products produced by beneficial bacteria, which enhances host immune response [5,6]. Elucidation of the interactions between diet and microbiome has raised the interest in functional foods with beneficial effects on gut microbiome and host health [7].

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of A. hookeri on gut microbiome in chicken. We investigated the changes in the composition of gut microorganisms in chicken by feeding leaves and roots of A. hookeri. We sequenced 24 caecal samples derived from six groups of chickens (four samples each). The groups included chickens fed with individual diets containing 0.3% leaves, 0.5% leaves, 0.3% roots, and 0.5% roots. The effects of A.hookeri as a feed additive were evaluated by comparing the groups exposed to A. hookeri diet with the control group (Control) or commercial supplement (CS). We examined whether A. hookeri altered the composition of microorganisms, and determined their effect on growth performance in chickens.

To elucidate the differences in microbiota exposed to different amounts of A. hookeri roots or leaves, a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on weighted UniFrac metrics was performed (Fig 1). Samples within the leaf group were clustered at shorter distances compared with those in the other groups. Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) was also used to determine the significant differences between groups. The variation between the six groups was observed (P-value < 0.05; Table 1). We also examined the effect of feeding with A. hookeri leaf and root on the composition of gut microorganisms by grouping the samples exposed to A. hookeri according to the tissue or amount. When we divided the samples exposed to A. hookeri leaves and roots irrespective of the amounts of A. hookeri, significant differences occurred between Control, CS, Leaf and Root. However, we did not find significant differences between Control, CS, 0.3% and 0.5%, when the samples were divided according to the amounts of A. hookeri.

The diversity of microorganisms within a local community was evaluated based on diversity and richness using Shannon index and the observed operational taxonomic unit (OTU), respectively (S1 Fig). The diversity showed a similar distribution of Shannon index across combinations except for Leaf 0.3 and Root 0.3 compared with CS (P = 0.02). Richness also showed similar distribution across groups with ‘combinations of tissue and amount’ of A. hookeri (P = 0.083) except for Leaf 0.3 compared with CS (P = 0.02). Compared with the control, diversity and richness were not affected by diets supplemented with A. hookeri (P = 0.5). In summary, while the differences between chickens exposed to leaf and other groups showed better diversity, the differences within a local community were not apparent when compared with the control.

At the phylum level, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the major groups of microorganisms in the cecum of chicken (Fig 2A), accounting for more than 80% and 10% of microorganisms, respectively. The amounts of most phyla including Firmicutes and Bacteoidetes showed no difference between supplements and Control or CS groups except for the composition of Cyanobacteria identified as Gastranaerophilales at the class level, which was decreased in Leaf 0.5 compared with that of the Control or CS. However, only limited information was available regarding the differences at the phylum level. Therefore, the differences in the abundance of microorganisms at the genus level were investigated.

The abundance of a few common genera varied in Control vs. Leaf 0.5, CS vs. Leaf 0.5, and CS vs Leaf 0.3. Parabacteriodes and Eubacterium nodatum group, which differed between chickens exposed to CS and Leaf 0.3 also varied in abundance in the Control and Leaf 0.5 groups. Most genera included in Leaf 0.5 compared with CS were also identified in Leaf 0.5 compared with Control. Eubacterium nodatum group, Marvinbryantia, Oscillospira, and Gelria species were common in both tests (Fig 2B). Significant and differentially abundant genera detected only in Leaf 0.5 compared with Control included Parabacteroides, Gastranaerophilaes, and NB1-n while the Christensenellacea R-7 group was found abundantly only in Leaf 0.5 compared with CS. We observed a decrease in the abundance of most of the genera except for Parabacteroides (Fig 2C). Eubacterium nodatum group showed almost undetected in chickens fed with Leaf 0.3 and Leaf 0.5. The abundance of Marvinbryantia, Gelria and NB1-n decreased gradually according to the amount of Leaf supplementation compared with their mean abundance in the Control. A rapid reduction in the levels of Oscillospira, Gastranaerophilales and Christensenellaceae R-7 group was observed in chickens exposed to Leaf 0.5.

A. hookeri not only affects the microbiome composition, but also the growth traits such as body weight, bone strength, and levels of infectious bursal disease (IBD) antibody. These traits were linked to gut microbiome in several studies [27,28]. The abundance of genera was correlated with growth traits. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were significant for 7, 5, and 7 genera with body weight, bone strength, and IBD antibody, respectively (Spearman's rho; P-value < 0.05).

Seven microorganisms correlated with antibody titers against IBD, including three species that were negatively correlated and four that were positively correlated (Fig 3C). The Eubacterium brachy group showed the highest correlation (Spearman's rho = 0.57), showing increased abundance in Leaf 0.3 and Leaf 0.5 but uniformly lower abundance in other groups. Parasutterella was positively correlated with bone strength and with IBD antibody production. The abundance of Gelria was significantly decreased in chickens fed with Leaf 0.5 and showed a negative correlation with IBD antibody (Spearman's rho = -0.44). Exposure to Leaf 0.5 also resulted in a similar pattern of microbial abundance correlated with IBD antibody, with a higher (or lower) abundance in chickens fed with Leaf 0.5 showing positive (or negative) correlation with IBD antibody.

Microbial functions predicted by phylogenetic investigation of communities via reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) were compared between chickens exposed to Control and Leaf 0.5 because the genera correlating with growth traits were associated with their abundance in Leaf 0.5 (Fig 4). Among the 38 different functions analyzed, 30 were associated with a lower abundance and eight with a higher abundance in chickens fed with Leaf 0.5. Most higher functions in Leaf 0.5 were related to metabolism. Enriched functions of microorganisms in Leaf 0.5 group such as C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, and galactose metabolism were included in carbohydrate metabolism. Most significantly, lysine degradation was depleted in Leaf 0.5. Among the functions depleted in chickens exposed to Leaf 0.5, the terms related to human disease were prevalent (S3 Fig). Especially, the functions of microorganisms depleted in Leaf 0.5 category related to pathways in cancer, renal cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and small cell lung cancer.

In the present study, body weight, bone strength, and IBD were measured. The Leaf 0.3 and Leaf 0.5 groups showed higher body weights (P-value: 0.001 and 0.052, respectively) compared with the control group (S4 Fig). Bone strength and IBD showed higher levels in the Leaf 0.3 and Leaf 0.5 groups.

This study demonstrated the effect of A. hookeri on gut microbiome, especially in the cecum of broiler chicken. In this study, we fed different feed supplements including A. hookeri to six groups of 1,200 broiler chickens, each group comprising 200 chickens: Control, CS, Leaf 0.3, Leaf 0.5, Root 0.3 and Root 0.5. Four chickens from each of the six groups with their weights similar to the average weight of the group were selected. Twenty-four samples from six groups were used for sequencing. The impact of Leaf 0.5 on the altered gut microbiome in this study may corroborate our previous study, which highlighted improved growth traits in Leaf 0.5. Based on multiple analysis of gut microbiome and phenotype of broiler chickens, this study provides deeper insight into the relationship between the intake of A. hookeri Leaf, microbial communities and growth performance.

In conclusion, our results showed the degree of alteration based on supplementation of A.hookeri, especially its leaf. The abundance of microorganisms was decreased in chickens exposed to A. hookeri leaves indicating that the leaf has a distinct effect on microbial communities. We also detected specific genera related to body weight, bone strength, and IBD antibody known to be important for productivity of broiler chickens. Therefore, the health benefit of A. hookeri in broiler chicken is mediated via its microbiome, suggesting that A. hookeri is a potential feed supplement for broiler chickens.

Experimental protocol and procedures were approved by the Small Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute of Agricultural Sciences (NAS201707). A total of 1200 male broiler chickens (Arbor Acres broilers) were grown for 35 days. They were divided into six groups (n = 200 chickens/group): Control, CS, Leaf 0.3, Leaf 0.5, Root 0.3, and Root 0.5. All groups were freely fed with a basal diet (crude protein (CP) 22%, metabolic energy (ME) 3,100 kcal/kg for 0–3 weeks; and CP 20%, ME 3,150 kcal/kg for 3–5 weeks). A diet containing 0.05% Commercial Xtract (ML Co, Seoul, Korea) was used in the CS group. A. hookeri leaf or root powder (0.3% or 0.5%) was added to Leaf 0.3, Leaf 0.5, Root 0.3, and Root 0.5 groups. The different powders of A.hookeri were prepared after freeze-drying and grinding. Four chickens in each of the six groups similar to the average group weight were selected. Thus, a total of 24 samples (four samples from each of the six groups) were used for sequencing.

Cecal samples were used for DNA extraction using AccuPrep Stool DNA Extraction Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. The V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA genes were PCR-amplified from the microbial genomic DNA. The DNA quality was determined using PicoGreen and Nonodrop methods. The input gDNA (10 ng) was PCR-amplified using the barcoded fusion primers 341F/805R (341F: 5’ CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG 3, 805R: 5’ GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC 3’). The final purified product was quantified using qPCR according to the qPCR Quantification Protocol Guide (KAPA Library Quantification kits for Illumina Sequencing platforms) and qualified using the LabChip GX HT DNA High Sensitivity Kit (PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA). The 300 paired-end sequencing reaction was performed on MiSeq™ platform (Illumina, San Diego, USA). The sequencing data were deposited into the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and accessed via accession number SRP151247.

De-multiplexed paired-end reads were merged with PEAR [52]. Pre-processed reads were analyzed using QIIME2 version 2017.12. We used DADA2 software package [53] implemented in QIIME2 to model and correct Illumina-sequenced FASTAQ files by removing chimeras using “consensus” method. QIIME2 q2-feature-classifier plugin was trained on a Silva database (Release 128) for 99% OTU full-length sequences.

Alpha and beta-diversity analyses were performed with q2-diversity plugin in QIIME2 at a sampling depth of 1000. Weighted Unifrac distance matrix was used for permutation multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and PCoA plots. PERMANOVA was performed with 999 permutations to weighted UniFrac distance matrix using Adonis in R package ‘vegan’ [54].

Trimmed Mean of M values (TMM) were obtained to adjust for different library sizes using edgeR [55]. Statistical tests were performed under generalized linear model (GLM) considering OTU counts as negative binomial distribution. To compare the goodness-of-fit of two models, the log-likelihood ratio was calculated. In the statistical test, the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to adjust for multiple testing errors with a significance level of 5% [56].

In the present study, body weight, bone strength, and IBD antibody level of experimental chicken were measured at 5 weeks of age [45]. Four chickens in each of the six groups similar to the average group weight were selected for the Performance analysis. Thus, a total of 24 samples (four samples from each of the six groups) were used for bone strength and IBD antibody level of blood collected from heart. Tibia strength was measured using instron (Model 3342, Inatron Universal Testing Machine, Instron Corp., Norwood, MA, USA). Effects of A. hookeri on antibody titer against IBD in growing chickens were evaluated by Hemmagglutination inhibition test (HI test).

The Student’s t-test was used to compare the growth traits between groups. The correlation between microbiota and growth traits was determined via Spearman correlation between TMM values of each sample and growth traits (body weight, bone strength and IBD antibody). The abundance (TMM value) of significantly correlated genera was visualized in a heat-map using pheatmap R package.

Phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) was used to predict functional profile of microbiota [57]. Since PICRUSt uses a closed reference OTU picking based on Greengenes database (version 13.5.), the features assigned to Greengenes databases were used. The abundance of functions in Control was compared to that in Leaf 0.5 using Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
