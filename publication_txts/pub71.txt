Current Evidence on the Role of the Gut Microbiome in ADHD Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Implications

Studies suggest that the bidirectional relationship existent between the gut microbiome (GM) and the central nervous system (CNS), or so-called the microbiome–gut–brain axis (MGBA), is involved in diverse neuropsychiatric diseases in children and adults. In pediatric age, most studies have focused on patients with autism. However, evidence of the role played by the MGBA in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood, is still scanty and heterogeneous. This review aims to provide the current evidence on the functioning of the MGBA in pediatric patients with ADHD and the specific role of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) in this interaction, as well as the potential of the GM as a therapeutic target for ADHD. We will explore: (1) the diverse communication pathways between the GM and the CNS; (2) changes in the GM composition in children and adolescents with ADHD and association with ADHD pathophysiology; (3) influence of the GM on the ω-3 PUFA imbalance characteristically found in ADHD; (4) interaction between the GM and circadian rhythm regulation, as sleep disorders are frequently comorbid with ADHD; (5) finally, we will evaluate the most recent studies on the use of probiotics in pediatric patients with ADHD.

Billions of microorganisms inhabit the human body (“microbiota”), including bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses and protozoa. They and their genes (“microbiome”) are involved in different biological functions, some of them are essential for our survival [1,2,3]. in particular, the microbiota living in the digestive tract is composed of more than 104 microorganisms from 300–3000 different species, which encode 200 times the number of human genes [4,5]. The gut bacteria mainly include six major phyla of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria, with Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes as the dominant ones [6]. This rich and diverse gut microbiome is of utmost importance, as it has far-reaching implications in a variety of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal functions. They participate in the metabolism and absorption of nutrients, including carbohydrates and proteins, bile acid, vitamins and other bioactive compounds [3,7]. Regarding the non-gastrointestinal functions, the gut microbiome has been reported to impact on the brain development [8,9,10,11] and the maturation of the immune [12] and neuroendocrine systems [13,14]. As a matter of fact, this impact takes place only during a critical period in growth and development and it cannot be reversed afterwards [12,15]. The effects caused by the gut microbiome begin even before birth, as the embryonic development is also influenced by the maternal gut microbiome [16].

In this review, we will focus on the participation of the gut microbiome into the pathophysiological mechanisms of ADHD and the therapeutic potential of these microorganisms in pediatric patients with this disorder.

The term “gut–brain axis” has been coined to describe the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system (CNS) [25,26]. This axis is also referred to as the “microbiota–gut–brain axis” (MGBA), to emphasize the participation of the gut microbiota in this interaction [27]. Three main pathways configure this axis: the nerve pathway, the neuroendocrine pathway and the immune pathway (Figure 1).

The gut is innervated by the hepatic and celiac branches of the vagus nerve. Depending on their location and type, vagal afferents detect a variety of mechanic (stretch, tension) and chemical stimuli (bacterial by-products, gut hormones, neurotransmitters) [28]. The vagus nerve plays a substantial role in mood regulation. Examples of this are the therapeutic use of vagus nerve stimulation in refractory depression [29] and chronic pain [30], probably associated with a modulation of catecholamine release in brain regions related to anxiety and depression [29]. A recent study in murine models reported that activation of gastrointestinal vagal afferents influence reward behavior [31]. The gut microbiome has the capacity to modulate the host’s emotional and behavioral responses by acting on the vagal afferents. In animal models, infections by pathogens like Campylobacter jejuni and Citrobacter amalonaticus induced anxiety-like behavior [32], whereas supplementation with probiotics including Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium longum alleviated these anxiety/depression-like conducts [33,34]. Interestingly, the behavioral effects induced by Lactobacillus reuteri in genetic mouse models of autism were halted in vagotomized mice [35].

As reported in animal studies, the gut microbiome regulates the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is involved in neurogenesis [59,60]. In adults with mild cognitive impairment, cognitive and attentional enhancement were reported after the administration of Lactobacillus plantarum for 12 weeks, which were associated with an increase in BDNF levels [61]. Lower levels of myelination in total brain and major grey and white matter structures at either 4 or 12 weeks of age were also found in GF mice [62]. In a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, fecal microbiota transplantation rebuilt the gut microbiome and provided therapeutic benefits by conferring protection on the myelin, with additional effects on the blood–brain barrier and the populations of astrocytes [63]. The apoptosis and neurodegeneration seem to be influenced by the gut microbiome, as neonatal GF mice exhibited increased apoptosis in the hypothalamus and the hippocampus in comparison with conventional mice [64]. Alterations of the gut microbiome may additionally lead to the promotion of amyloid formation [65], whereas probiotic supplementation can prevent or even stop this process [18,66].

The gut microbiome is essential in the development and function of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, which represents the crux of the neuroendocrine transmission and the stress response system [14]. In GF mice, the HPA axis response was exaggerated and the sensitivity to negative feedback signals was reduced. The administration of Bifidobacterium infantis at an early stage reversed this response [13,14]. In human patients with irritable bowel syndrome, exaggerated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol responses were observed after infusion of corticotropin-release factor (CRF) [67], together with a dysfunctional microbiota [68]. The gut microbiome directly influences the production of glucocorticoids and immune mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukins-1beta and 6 (IL-1β and IL-6), which in turn stimulates the HPA axis [69].

The gut microbiome also creates other substances derived from the metabolism of proteins and amine acids, such as ammonia (NH3) [89], which in excessive levels (hyperammoniemia) represents an important risk factor for neurological diseases, like hepatic encephalopathy and autism [90].

The development and integrity of the gut barrier and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are dependent on the gut microbiome. Alterations of the gut microbiome downregulate the expression of the tight junctions (TJs) [91], exposing both organs to biomacromolecules and microorganisms and triggering the neuroinflammation process [92].

Acquired immunity develops and matures during exposure to the gut microbiota. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (CD4/CD8 double-positive alpha-alpha T cells specifically) were reported to require the presence of L. reuteri, together with a tryptophan-rich diet, to reprogram intraepithelial CD4-positive T cells into immunoregulatory T cells [101]. In a study exploring the effects of chronic stress on long-lasting altered levels of IL-10+ T regulatory cells, an association was found between the concentrations of IL-10 and the abundance of Clostridium [102]. Absence of microbiota also reduces the content of immunoglobulins A and G1 (IgA and IgG1) and increases the levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), thereby inducing the appearance of diverse diseases [12]. A recent study determined the microbial composition and immunoglobulin profile in fecal samples from 32 healthy infants with a high risk of developing type 1 diabetes as determined by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping. IgA levels correlated with relative abundances of Bifidobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae, whereas IgG levels were associated with Haemophilus [103].

ADHD is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in children and adolescents, affecting 5% of individuals younger than 18 years [104,105]. It is characterized by the permanent and impairing presence of inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity. These core symptoms must appear before the age of 12 in accordance with the new diagnostic criteria (DSM-5) [106]. The course of this disorder is variable, and some symptoms may persist into adulthood in around 40–60% of cases [107]. ADHD impacts on many aspects of an individual’s wellbeing, including physical health and academic, social and occupational functioning. It is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric and neurological conditions, such as ASD, mood disorders, epilepsy or sleep problems, creating a substantial burden for the individual, their family and the community [108]. Psychostimulants, and methylphenidate (MPH) in particular, represent the first-line medication for moderate and severe cases of ADHD in children from 5 years and over and in young patients [109]. Its efficacy mainly lies in increasing the extracellular levels of DA and norepinephrine (NE) [110], although it has additional effects on other neurotransmitter systems also involved in ADHD pathophysiology, such as 5-HT [111] and even Glu [112]. However, the long-term use of psychostimulants is often limited by poor compliance and tolerability problems derived from the combination of adverse effects, ADHD-related stigma and social resistance to medication, particularly in adolescents [113,114].

Nowadays, there is increasing evidence that the aforementioned etiological factors and catecholaminergic dysfunction may lead to a neuronal state predominantly characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation, which could perpetuate the neurochemical alterations responsible for ADHD [124]. Increased levels of oxidative and nitrosative (NO) stress markers, together with a decrease in the concentrations of antioxidants, have been found in ADHD [125,126]. Furthermore, an alteration in the mitochondrial number and function in the dopaminergic neurons have been reported in individuals with ADHD in comparison with controls [127,128]. A dysregulation of the mitochondrial function provokes an uncontrolled production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive oxygen nitrogen species (RONS), which are by-products of the oxidative reactions leading to the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [129]. Excessive levels of ROS/RONS harm the integrity of neurons by oxidating the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that constitute their membranes, as well as alter the apoptotic mechanisms. ROS/RONS also prompt the activation of the microglia and the release of inflammatory cytokines and the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, creating a vicious cycle [130,131]. In fact, Oades et al. [132] reported elevated levels of the inflammatory interleukins IL-16 and IL-13 in children with ADHD, which would respectively be associated with hyperactive-impulsive symptoms and inattention.

Aarts et al. [133] were the first authors to report microbial composition differences in Dutch young adult patients with ADHD using the next-generation sequencing of 16S rDNA in fecal samples. No significant differences in either alpha diversity (within-sample), which accounts for species richness, or beta diversity (between-sample), which indicates differences in diversity between the two cohorts, were found between ADHD patients and healthy controls. However, within the phylum Actinobacteria, the genus Bifidobacterium was significantly increased in the ADHD cohort. The authors also predicted bacterial gene function in relation to the metabolic pathways involved in the synthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. Interestingly, the relative abundance in the genus Bifidobacterium was correlated with a significant increase in the enzyme cyclohexadienyl dehydratase (CDT), which is involved in the synthesis of a dopaminergic precursor (phenylalanine). In a subset of 28 participants, independent of diagnosis, Aarts et al. also performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis to correlate the differences in microbial composition with neural reward responses. They observed a negative association between the relative abundance of CDT and reward anticipation responses in bilateral ventral striatum. Reward anticipation, which is dependent on DA neurotransmission [134], is crucial to direct actions towards positively balanced stimuli and has been reported to be reduced in ADHD patients [135]. Aarts et al. highlighted that the differential microbiome composition found between patients with ADHD and controls in their study may account for altered reward anticipation responses, which is a neural hallmark of ADHD. The novelty of this study resided in it representing the first report on a genetic capacity of the gut microbiome to impact on the dopaminergic metabolic pathways in patients with ADHD. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to several limitations: first, the age gap between controls and cases (27.1 vs. 19.5 years in average), as well as the differences in sample sizes (controls = 77 participants; ADHD subjects = 17 patients); second, the intake of medications by ADHD patients was not reported in detail; third, differences between groups in relation to potential confounders, such as dietary patterns or the intake of antibiotics, which could have influenced the differences found, were not mentioned either; finally, the inclusion of unaffected ADHD patients’ siblings in the could have affected the representativeness of the control group. The gut microbiome of siblings to ADHD patients could express an intermediate phenotype between patients and non-related controls. Therefore, it may not represent an appropriate reference group for comparison [136].

A schematic representation of bacterial taxonomy to facilitate comprehension is shown in Figure 2.

Omega-3 PUFAs, and particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), play an important role in membrane fluidity, neurotransmission and receptor function [163,164]. They affect the levels of BDNF and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a neuroprotective and important trophic factor in dopaminergic neurons [165]. Lower brain DHA content during development is associated with frontocortical dopaminergic hypofunction [166]. In animal male models of ADHD, a diet enriched in omega-3 PUFAs was followed by an increased striatal turnover of DA, 5-HT, improved attention and decreased impulsivity [167]. Omega-3 PUFAs also have essential anti-inflammatory properties, as they reduce the levels of the pro-inflammatory interleukin IL-1β by inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome [168].

A representation of the interaction between the gut microbiome and omega-3 PUFAs, and how this relationship could interfere with ADHD pathophysiological mechanisms, is shown in Figure 3.

Sleep disorders represent one of the most frequent comorbidities in children with ADHD. They can be present in up to 70% of patients [176], affecting their cognitive, behavioral and physical state [177], and thus increasing parental stress levels [178]. Patients with ADHD suffer from variable sleep disruptions, but the most consistent finding is probably the presence of a delayed circadian phase (evening preference), with a consequent disturbance in daytime functioning [179,180]. The exact neurobiological mechanisms underlying the sleep disorders in ADHD are yet to be fully determined, but they have been associated with a circadian dysfunction in which the evening increase in endogenous melatonin secretion (dim light melatonin onset) is significantly delayed [181,182]. Pineal melatonin synthesis is controlled by the central circadian clock in the CNS, which generates circadian rhythms through the transcriptional/translational feedback loops existent between the different clock genes (Bmal:Clock, Per:Cry, Rorα, Rev-erbα, Chrono) [129]. Indeed, several polymorphisms of the CLOCK gene might be associated with susceptibility to ADHD [183,184].

In a Chinese population of 120 children with ASD, Hua et al. [191] explored the differences in the composition of the gut microbiome and its metabolites between those patients who suffered from sleep disorders (n = 60) and those without sleep problems (n = 60). Sleep disorders were assessed through the Children Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ). Microbial DNA was extracted from stool samples and analyzed through next-generation sequencing of 16S rDNA. No information on medication or dietary patterns was included. Abundance and richness of the gut microbiota were significantly higher in ASD children with sleep problems. No significant differences were observed in the Firmicutes:Bacteroides ratio, but at the genus level, a significant reduction in the butyrate-producing bacteria Faecalibacterium and Agathobacter was found in the sleep disorder group. The abundance of each of the two genera was negatively correlated with CSHQ scores. Three differential metabolites were observed between sleep disorder and no sleep disorder groups: concentrations of 3-hydroxybutyric acid (a butyrate-derived acid) and melatonin were significantly lower among patients with ASD and sleep problems, whereas levels of 5-HT were significantly higher. The concentrations of 3-hydroxybutyric acid were correlated with melatonin levels and Faecalibacterium abundance. Additionally, a positive correlation was also found between melatonin concentrations and the abundances of Faecalibacterium and Agathobacter. Due to the design of the study, it was not possible to elucidate if the differences observed in the gut microbiome were due to a circadian dysregulation in patients with ASD, or if a previous alteration in the microbial composition contributed to the changes observed in melatonin concentrations. Another limitation was the absence of a control group to be compared with the populations with ASD, apart from the absence of information on dietary patterns and medication intake. Notwithstanding, this study provided compelling evidence for an association between microbial metabolites (butyrate) and melatonin. Studies on the bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiome and the sleep/wake circadian rhythm in ADHD are lacking. However, given the evidence provided and the genetic overlap between ASD and ADHD [192], it seems plausible to suggest the existence of similar alterations in children with ADHD and sleep disorders.

Given the documented involvement of the MGBA in the pathophysiological mechanisms of ADHD, it may be reasonable to consider the gut microbiome as a potential therapeutic target for this disorder. In this regard, probiotics are living non-pathological microorganisms that provide a health benefit by improving physiological conditions in the host when they are administered in adequate amounts, well as a food ingredient, supplement or as a drug [193]. To date, species of the genus Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium represent the most investigated strains [194].

As suggested by Cerdó et al. [203], there are still considerable divergences between studies in dosage, type of strain, intervention period, microbiome composition analysis, methods for neurological assessment, identification of potential confounding factors, study design and sample size. For standardization purposes, future research is needed to identify the most effective doses and combination of probiotics, as well as the minimum intervention period to observe clinically meaningful results in ADHD symptoms and associated comorbidities.

In the present review, we have aimed to provide the current evidence on: the role of the gut microbiome in ADHD pathophysiology and possible association with symptoms; implication of the gut microbiome in the omega-3/omega-6 PUFA imbalance found in patients with ADHD; interaction between the gut microbiome and circadian rhythms; and the therapeutic role of probiotics in pediatric patients with ADHD. Certainly, we have carefully selected and described the most recent studies on the aforementioned research lines. However, this is a narrative review, as such, our work is essentially informative and has limited capacity to assess the robustness of the results provided by the current literature in these topics. We have tried to improve this by: highlighting the limitations of the different studies, making a judgement of their novelty, quality and reliability; grouping studies according to their results, in order to show controversies and inconsistencies among them; and including final remarks with suggestions on the aspects that require to be improved in future studies. On the other hand, we cannot discard a possible selection bias, given by the absence of a detailed search strategy designed a priori. Therefore, a systematic review, with a previous comprehensive plan to identify all relevant studies on the topic and the use of statistical analysis to measure effect sizes, would have provided more solid conclusions to our initial hypothesis. A systematic assessment of the quality of the studies could also have been included, through the use of the Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment scale for Cohort and Case-Control Studies (NOS) [204] and the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT Statement) [205].

The gut microbiome maintains a bidirectional relationship with its host through neurological, hormonal and immune mechanisms, configuring the microbiome–gut–brain axis (MGBA). Alterations of the MGBA are responsible for the appearance of diverse neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders in pediatric populations. In children and adolescents with ADHD, the MGBA is involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress that give rise not only to the ADHD core symptoms, but also to associated comorbidities, such as sleep disorders. Furthermore, changes in the gut microbiome may also constitute the basis for the efficacy of new alternative therapies currently under investigation, such as omega-3 PUFAs. Thus, the gut microbiome could represent a potential therapeutic target in children and adolescents with ADHD.

Nevertheless, current studies still offer heterogeneous results due to substantial methodological differences in relation to sample size, participant selection criteria, neuropsychological assessment of participants, identification of confounding factors, microbiome analysis techniques, dosage and combination of probiotics, and duration of the intervention period. This could be improved by conducting studies that: include a formal calculation of the required sample size and clearly defined recruitment procedures, including information on the intake of ADHD medication and dietary patterns; use standardized psychometric scales to evaluate ADHD symptoms in accordance with the current diagnostic criteria (DSM-5); have designs that allow inferring causality; use high-resolution techniques beyond 16S rDNA sequencing for taxonomy and functional analysis, such as whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics. Future research lines should be focused on the design of protocols to standardize the supplementation with probiotics in pediatric populations: composition, dose and time of supplementation.
