Crohn’s Disease, Host–Microbiota Interactions, and Immunonutrition: Dietary Strategies Targeting Gut Microbiome as Novel Therapeutic Approaches

Crohn’s disease (CD) is a complex, disabling, idiopathic, progressive, and destructive disorder with an unknown etiology. The pathogenesis of CD is multifactorial and involves the interplay between host genetics, and environmental factors, resulting in an aberrant immune response leading to intestinal inflammation. Due to the high morbidity and long-term management of CD, the development of non-pharmacological approaches to mitigate the severity of CD has recently attracted great attention. The gut microbiota has been recognized as an important player in the development of CD, and general alterations in the gut microbiome have been established in these patients. Thus, the gut microbiome has emerged as a pre-eminent target for potential new treatments in CD. Epidemiological and interventional studies have demonstrated that diet could impact the gut microbiome in terms of composition and functionality. However, how specific dietary strategies could modulate the gut microbiota composition and how this would impact host–microbe interactions in CD are still unclear. In this review, we discuss the most recent knowledge on host–microbe interactions and their involvement in CD pathogenesis and severity, and we highlight the most up-to-date information on gut microbiota modulation through nutritional strategies, focusing on the role of the microbiota in gut inflammation and immunity.

Crohn’s disease (CD), a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), refers to a complex disabling, idiopathic, progressive, and destructive disorder with an unknown etiology that could affect any segment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [1]. It is estimated that CD could affect up to 300 in 100,000 individuals in westernized countries in Europe, North America, and Oceania, and it is associated with high morbidity and a high economic burden [2]. Crohn’s disease is a chronic remitting and relapsing inflammatory disease characterized by skip intestinal lesions affecting the gut wall along the GI tract, which can lead to chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, obstruction, and/or perianal lesions [3]. The pathogenesis of CD is multifactorial and involves the interplay between the host’s genetics, immune system, and gut microbiota, which are influenced by environmental factors and result in an aberrant response in the GI tract with subsequent intestinal inflammation [4].

The intestinal gut microbiome has emerged as a pre-eminent target for potential new therapeutic treatments in CD. The human gut microbiota harbors more than 1014 microorganisms (including bacteria, virus, and yeast), which have a symbiotic and mutualistic relationship with the host. Since the moment of birth, the gut microbiota plays an important role in physiological processes such as the development of the immune system, intestinal homeostasis, behavior, and host metabolism [11,12,13]. Imbalance in the gut microbiome, the so-called dysbiosis, is associated with metabolic and gastrointestinal conditions such as IBD, which includes CD, and ulcerative colitis (UC) [14]. Among the factors that meaningfully affect the microbiota, diet is one of the key players in maintaining a well-balanced and healthy gut-microbial microenvironment. Thus, the development of specific diets aimed at the modification of gut microbiota has arisen as a promising cost-effective strategy to improve CD management and evolution. In this review, we discuss the most recent knowledge on host–microbe interactions and their involvement in the pathogenesis and severity of CD, and we highlight the most up-to-date information on nutritional interventions targeting the modulation of gut-microbiota composition and the immune system.

The gut microbiome is closely linked to the immune system and is a key player in the pathogenesis of CD [15]. The emergence of new molecular techniques and bioinformatics tools in the last decade has provided a better understanding of the alterations associated with a pathological status of the microbiome and its associated metabolome. Multiple human microbiome studies have demonstrated a close relationship between such dysbiosis and certain clinical aspects of CD, including inflammation, intestinal permeability, and postoperative CD recurrence [16,17]. Thus, these studies have established that patients with CD showed reductions in bacterial diversity and altered abundance of certain taxa including a reduction in health-promoting microorganisms (e.g., Faecalibacterium and Roseburia spp.) and an increase in pathogenic microorganisms (e.g., Escherichia, Fusobacterium, and Mycobacterium spp.) [18]. Furthermore, increasing evidence support that such dysbiosis might be a causal factor in the development and evolution of chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases such as CD [19]. Despite this growing evidence, the exact mechanisms involved in host–microbe interactions in CD pathophysiology have not been yet fully understood.

Susceptibility to CD is dependent on different elements, including genetic predisposition and environmental factors, such as diet and pollution. Importantly, these non-genetic factors are well-known to have an important impact on the gut microbiome composition of the host [20]. Microbiome components interact with the host’s immune system to play a key role in the maintenance of physiological homeostasis. Thus, the disruption of a healthy microbiome or the reduction in the ratio of certain beneficial commensal microorganisms, resulting in a dysbiosis, may induce an exacerbated activation of the mucosal immune system associated with an exacerbated and altered cytokine production that contributes to the establishment and progression of CD [21].

An open question in this field is whether the dysbiosis seen in CD precedes inflammation or whether dysbiosis is a consequence of the inflammatory process. An interesting study that analyzed the microbiota composition in mucosal tissue biopsies and fecal samples of treatment-naive pediatric patients with CD revealed an increased abundance of Veillonellaceae, Paturellaceae, Neisseriaceae, Fusobacteriaceae spp., and E. coli spp., and a decreased abundance of Clostridiales, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium spp., Roseburia spp., Blautia spp., Ruminococcus spp., and Lachnospiraceae spp. [18]. As this study investigated a newly diagnosed population, it suggests that microbiota changes occur early and may precede clinical disease. Indeed, a recent study using a genetic model of CD (deficient in two CD susceptibility genes, NOD2 and phagocyte NADPH oxidase) demonstrated an increase in pathobiont species preceding the onset of colitis [46]. These observations suggest that dysbiosis in CD can be present before inflammation, suggesting a key role of the gut microbiome in CD pathogenesis. Figure 1 shows an overview of the inflammatory mechanisms described in CD in relation to microbial dysbiosis.

Involvement of the gut microbiome in CD pathogenesis was initially suggested by Rutgeerts et al., after observing that CD recurrence was decreased or eliminated in patients undergoing surgical diversion of the fecal stream [47]. These observations were later confirmed by another group, after seeing that exposure of distal limb to luminal content was associated with recurrence of inflammation after surgical resection [48]. Further evidence indicating a key role of microbial involvement in CD comes from animal models, where the transfer of fecal microbiota from mice with colitis-initiated inflammation in healthy mice [49]. Moreover, colitis-susceptible mice with T cell receptor-alpha beta (TCRαβ) mutations develop colitis when colonized with a conventional microbiota but not when raised in germ-free conditions [50].

Other data has also indicated that the interaction of fungal and bacterial microorganisms could regulate the outcome of IBD. Thus, a reduction in the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae caused by the presence of C. albicans reduced the development of murine colitis [76]. Overall, all these recent studies indicate that not only bacteria have an impact on the host response and CD pathogenesis, but also other microorganisms, including fungi and virome, are key players in CD pathogenesis.

As described above, compositional changes in the gut microbiota are potential contributing factors in driving inflammation in CD. Importantly, alterations in the gut bacteria will alter the bacterially generated metabolite landscape of the gut. These bacterial metabolites (e.g., secondary bile acids (BAs), SCFAs, etc.), have been shown to have an impact on many host processes including metabolism, epithelial barrier integrity, and innate and adaptive immune responses [77].

SCFAs are bacterial metabolites derived from the fermentation of indigestible fibers, of which acetate, propionate, and butyrate are the most abundantly produced by the gut microbiota [91]. The main functions of SCFAs in the intestine consist of maintenance of homeostasis, intestinal epithelial-cell turnover, energy metabolism, or induction of epithelial-barrier function [92]. In addition, SCFAs can act as an energy source for colonocytes as well as exert an immunomodulatory effect. In particular, butyrate has been widely described to promote an anti-inflammatory response, through the differentiation of Treg cells as well as through the inhibition of NF-κB signaling and the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs) [93,94], via its interaction with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (e.g., GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A). The main butyrate-producing bacteria include the Roseburia and Faecalibacterium genera, belonging to the Firmicutes phylum [95,96,97], which are known to be significantly reduced in patients with CD [92]. Consequently, levels of luminal butyrate are diminished in these patients, leading, thus, to an exacerbated immune response [98,99]. The effects of SCFA in IBD pathogenesis have been widely studied and their role as inflammation regulators has been recently reviewed by others [100,101].

Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs), which are small, spherically bilayer (100–300 nm) vesicles generated by Gram-negative bacteria have been recently described to play a role in the pathophysiology of IBD [102]. In epithelial cells, OMVs specifically secreted by AIEC stimulated IL-8 secretion and promoted AIEC internalization into the mucosa [103,104]. OMVs produced from another IBD-associated pathobiont, Bacteroides vulgatus, were reported to both silence dendritic cells [105], activate NF-κB, and stimulate IL-8 production in epithelial cells [106]. A similar immunomodulatory potential has been ascribed to B. fragilis OMVs containing polysaccharide A (PSA), which can regulate TLR4 transcription in epithelial cells [107] and increase the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [108]. Another recent study reported that B. thetaiotaomicron OMVs stimulated the expression of IL-10 in colonic dendritic cells, as well as IL-10 and IL-6 in blood-derived dendritic cells in healthy individuals, but not in colonic or peripheral dendritic cells in patients with either CD or UC [109]. Overall, these data indicate an immunomodulatory potential of OMVs by targeting mucosal and systemic cell responses, which are highly dependent on the target cell.

As previously stated, the gut microbiota has been recently recognized as one of the main factors involved in the pathogenesis of CD. Studies on the microbiome have shown that patients with CD have dysbiosis with decreased diversity, high instability, and high inter-individual variability [110,111]. Furthermore, a reduction in Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, together with an increase in Proteobacteria, are common hallmarks in patients with CD [52]. Thus, it is not surprising that over the last decades, alternative strategies based on the use of pre-/probiotics, have been developed to complement or even replace pharmacological therapy for the treatment of IBD [112]. The role of prebiotics and probiotics in CD management has been extensively discussed and reviewed in detail elsewhere [113,114,115,116,117]. Several probiotic strains known to have beneficial effects on health have been tested in human clinical studies including Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., E. coli Nissle 1917, and Saccharomyces boulardii [19]. Noteworthy, while the efficacy of probiotics such as VSL#3, containing a mixture of eight bacterial strains including four Lactobacillus spp., three strains of Bifidobacterium spp., and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. Thermophilus, has been well established for UC management, but attempts to prove their usefulness in CD have produced controversial results [113]. These incongruences might be in part explained by differences in study design, methodology, the variety of pre- or probiotics used, and/or patients’ compliance. Thus, further research is needed to confirm the above-mentioned health claims [118]. Due to this controversy, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines on clinical nutrition in IBD do not currently recommend (and even discourage) the use of probiotics for the treatment and management of CD [9].

Alternatively, prebiotics (non-digestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria), such as oligosaccharides, inulin, or polyphenols, have been proposed as an option for the modulation of the gut microbiome as CD therapy. For instance, inulin supplementation in a rat model of colitis induced changes in the gut microbiota profile, including an increase in Lactobacillus spp., and amelioration of the symptoms [119]. Similarly, resveratrol (a polyphenol found at high concentrations in grapes) was described to increase Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, accompanied by a decrease in inflammation markers in a rat model of colitis [120]. Nevertheless, so far, no study has yet verified the efficacy of prebiotics in patients with CD.

There have been several attempts to identify dietary patterns and the risk of CD progression. A recent meta-analysis identified a “healthy” diet (defined as a high intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, low-fat dairy products, fiber, poultry, fish, nuts, and whole-grain foods) as a protective factor against CD development [121]. However, the relationship between specific diets and the increased risk of CD is less clear [121]. On the other hand, a relationship between the intake of specific foods and nutrients with a microbiota enriched in bacteria that modulate the inflammatory response has been also proposed [122]. For instance, the consumption of high-sugar foods has been related to the reduced abundance of anti-inflammatory bacteria (F. prausnitzii and Roseburia hominis), while plant-based foods were linked to an increase in SCFA-producers with potential anti-inflammatory effects [111,122]. Among the proposed mechanisms of action involved in the response to therapy in patients with CD, modulation of the gut microbiota composition by diet appears as one of the most important factors. Thus, the management of CD should not only focus on the use of pharmacological strategies, but it should also include nutritional interventions, especially aimed at modulating the immune response and reversing gut dysbiosis [8,123].

a Registry number of the trial is indicated when available. BMI, body mass index; CD, Crohn’s disease; CDED, Crohn’s disease exclusion diet; CRP, C-reactive protein; EEN, exclusive enteral nutrition; EIF2, eukaryotic initiation factor 2; FODMAP, fermentable, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols; GI, gastrointestinal; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; LRD, low-residue diet; MSCD, modified specific carbohydrate diet; PEN, partial enteral nutrition; SCD, Specific Carbohydrate Diet; SCFA, short-chain fatty acids; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; UC, ulcerative colitis.

Notwithstanding, therapeutic diets should be thoroughly supervised by an experienced nutritionist, as any nutritional deficiency or imbalance may lead to negative outcomes such as malnutrition or growth delay in children [149].

Crohn’s disease is a complex, disabling, idiopathic, progressive, and destructive disorder with an unknown etiology. The management and treatment of CD are currently based on pharmacological strategies with high co-morbidities and health burden associated. Thus, the development of more cost-effective mitigation strategies has become a priority. Over the years, there have been several attempts to develop non-pharmacological therapies to ameliorate CD activity, including nutritional approaches specifically designed to reinforce the immune system and reduce intestinal inflammation.

On the other hand, studies have shown that diet can remarkably impact both the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota to maintain a healthy gut. Nevertheless, the precise knowledge of how specific dietary strategies affect host–microbe interactions in IBD, and more specifically in CD, is still insufficient. In addition, the lack of standardization of clinical trials, variability in the design, and failure in compliance entails a major limitation in these types of studies. Thus, the optimization of nutritional interventions that could complement the currently used pharmacological therapies or therapies used to ameliorate CD symptoms is a field of special biomedical interest. In this regard, while the usefulness of microbial-based therapies is still controversial, the implementation of some diets, such as SCD, low-FODMAP, and more recently CDED, are being recognized as potentially interesting for this purpose, although data are still scarce. Thus, more well-designed, adequately powered randomized, controlled clinical trials are needed to confirm the potential benefit of such nutritional interventions, as well as to unravel the key cellular and molecular players and their specific roles in driving potential health benefits.
