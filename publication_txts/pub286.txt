A Mesh-Duox pathway regulates homeostasis in the insect gut



The metazoan gut harbors complex communities of commensal and symbiotic bacterial microbes. The quantity and quality of these microbes fluctuate dynamically in response to physiological changes. The mechanisms that hosts developed to respond to and manage such dynamic changes and maintain homeostasis remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a dual oxidase (Duox)-regulating pathway that contributes in maintaining homeostasis in the gut of both Aedes aegypti and Drosophila melanogaster. We show that a gut membrane-associated protein, named Mesh, plays an important role in controlling proliferation of gut bacteria by regulating Duox expression through an Arrestin-mediated MAPK JNK/ERK phosphorylation cascade. Expression of both Mesh and Duox is correlated with the gut bacterial microbiome that, in mosquitoes, increases dramatically soon after a blood meal. Ablation of Mesh abolishes Duox induction leading to an increase of the gut microbiome load. Our study reveals that the Mesh-mediated signaling pathway is a central homeostatic mechanism of the insect gut.

The intestinal tract of most metazoans harbors complex communities of microbes that contribute to maintaining homeostasis with the gut epithelia. These microbes manipulate a wide range of physiological in the host, including nutrition, development, differentiation and defense1–3. Although these microbial communities maintain homeostasis with the gut epithelia, their quantity and composition dynamically fluctuate in response to the host dietary situations, environmental conditions and physical activities4. The gut epithelia have developed mechanisms to tolerate commensal microorganisms5–10, while the microorganisms have developed mechanisms to evade the host immune response11,12. Nonetheless, the gut epithelia are required to mount a finely tuned immune response of proper strength and duration in response to microbial fluctuation in a timely and appropriate manner. The molecular mechanisms employed by the gut epithelia to manage the dynamic fluctuation of microbes and maintain homeostasis are not well understood.

The complement control protein (CCP) domain is an evolutionarily conserved module essential for complement-mediated immune functions19–22. We have previously demonstrated that the CCP domain plays an important role in insect-microbe interactions23,24. In this study, we show that a CCP-containing protein named Mesh25 regulates commensal bacterial proliferation through regulation of Duox expression in the gut of both Drosophila and A. aegypti, via a signaling cascade involving Arrestin-mediated MAPK JNK/ERK phosphorylation. In both insects, Mesh expression correlates with the gut commensal bacterial load, enabling Duox abundance to be dynamically regulated by microbial fluctuation. Since generation of Duox-mediated ROS is a major gut immune response in maintenance of insect gut homeostasis, our study reveals a fine-tuning mechanism for Duox expression to manage healthy gut-microbe interactions in insects.

Proteins with CCP domains are key immune factors restricting microbial infection in invertebrates23,24,26. Here, we assessed the roles of CCP-domain proteins23 in maintenance of the gut commensal bacteria in the mosquito A. aegypti. Ten genes encoding CCP domains23 were silenced individually via thoracic microinjection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Six days later, the midguts of dsRNA-treated mosquitoes were dissected for determination of the gut bacterial load by qPCR27. The results showed that knockdown of the AAEL005432 gene, but not other genes, significantly induced 4- to 5-fold proliferation of the gut microbiome in A. aegypti, compared to that found in green fluorescent protein (GFP) dsRNA-treated A. aegypti, suggesting an antibacterial role of this protein in mosquito gut immunity (Fig. 1a). AAEL005432 shares high sequence identity with the Drosophila melanogaster Mesh (CG31004) (DmMesh) that was previously identified as a transmembrane component of the gut septate junctions25 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Moreover, the AAEL005432-encoded protein is predicted to contain domains that are identical to those of DmMesh (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Therefore, we refer to this gene as A. aegypti Mesh, i.e. AaMesh.

We next determined whether the Mesh-Duox signaling axis changes the gut microbial composition in Drosophila and A. aegypti. The midguts were isolated from the mosquitoes (AaMesh dsRNA vs GFP dsRNA) and Drosophila (DmMesh RNAi vs GFP RNAi) for bacterial 16S rDNA pyrosequencing. Intriguingly, dsRNA-mediated AaMesh knockdown enhanced the composition of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, but decreased that of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the midgut of A. aegypti (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b and Supplementary Table 2,3). In Drosophila, enhancement of Proteobacteria and impairment of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in bacterial composition were determined in the gut of DmMesh RNAi flies (Supplementary Fig. 8c,d and Supplementary Table 4,5), suggesting that the Mesh-Duox axis-based regulation pathway is specific for particular bacterium.

In insect intestine, ROS is produced via the catalytic action of NADPH oxidases, including Nox31 and Duox7,32. A particular commensal bacteria genus in the Drosophila guts, Lactobacillus, can stimulate Nox-dependent ROS production to facilitate cellular proliferation in intestinal stem cells. A specific Nox-dependent ROS generation in the gut epithelial cells may act as an important role in ROS-mediated intestinal homeostasis33. Nevertheless, many previous studies indicated the pivotal roles of Duox in regulating homeostasis and the composition of the gut commensal bacterial community in Drosophila6, Aedes aegypti15 and Bactrocera dorsalis16. To address this, we therefore generated both DmNox (CG34399) RNAi and DmDuox RNAi GAL4 Drosophila lines driven by a midgut-specific NP3084 promoter. Compared to that in the GFP RNAi control flies, the burden of gut commensal bacteria was enhanced in both the DmNox RNAi and the DmDuox RNAi Drosophila gut (Supplementary Fig. 9a,b). We further silenced either A. aegypti Nox (AaNox) or AaDuox by dsRNA inoculation in A. aegypti, respectively. In consistent with the studies in flies, knockdown of both NADPH oxidase genes also enhanced the burden of gut microbiota in the mosquito midgut (Supplementary Fig. 9c,d), suggesting both NADPH oxidases are important for the ROS-mediated intestinal homeostasis.

We next explored Nox regulation in the Mesh-mediated signaling pathway. In contrast to the significant DmDuox reduction in the DmMesh RNAi fly guts, expression of the DmNox gene was not regulated by silencing DmMesh (Supplementary Fig. 9e). Furthermore, there was no influence of AaNox transcript in the gut of dsRNA-mediated AaMesh-silenced mosquitoes (Supplementary Fig. 9f), suggesting that Mesh controls insect gut-microbe homeostasis by regulating the expression of Duox, but not Nox gene.

We examined the roles of major immune signaling pathways in AaDuox and AaMesh expression in the mosquito gut through dsRNA-mediated knockdown of key pathway modulators, including components of the MAPK pathways (AaP38, AaERK and AaJNK), AaMyd88 of the Toll pathway, AaImd of the Immune deficiency (Imd) pathway, AaDome of (Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transduction and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (AaPI3K) and AaAkt of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (Supplementary Fig. 10a–h). Silencing either AaERK or AaJNK, but not any of the other immune signaling modulators, significantly reduced AaDuox expression in the mosquito midgut (Fig. 3a). However, none of the above-mentioned gene knockdowns affected AaMesh mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. 10i), suggesting that AaERK and AaJNK may act downstream of AaMesh, but upstream of AaDuox. Indeed, knockdown of either AaERK or AaJNK reduced ROS production in the A. aegypti gut (Supplementary Fig. 11a,b), and increased the gut microbiome load (Fig. 3b,c).

We next tested our findings in the Drosophila gut by exploiting the UAS/GAL4 system to knockdown DmERK (CG12559) and DmJNK (CG5680) via GAL4 lines driven by the NP3084 promoter. Both MAPK genes were stably knocked down in the Drosophila gut (Supplementary Fig. 14a,b), resulting in a significant downregulation of DmDuox expression (Fig. 4a,b), a reduction of ROS activity (Fig. 4c) and an increase of the gut bacterial load (Fig. 4d). We next exploited DmArrestin-1 (CG5711) and DmArrestin-2 (CG5962) RNAi flies for investigation. Silencing DmArrestin-1 and DmArrestin-2 showed the consistent phenotypes in regulation of DmDuox expression (Fig. 4e), ROS activity (Fig. 4f) and gut bacterial burden (Fig. 4g). To further examine the role of the Mesh-Arrestin-ERK/JNK signaling cascade in Duox expression, we silenced both of the DmArrestin genes by dsRNA transfection in Drosophila S2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 15a,b) that ectopically express DmMesh, and then examined the DmDuox mRNA abundance. Indeed, ectopic expression of DmMesh induced ERK/JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 4h) and Duox expression (Fig. 4i), which were abolished following knockdown of either of the DmArrestins, further validating that Mesh regulates Duox expression via Arrestin-mediated MAPK phosphorylation. We next introduced the DmDuox gene into DmArrestins RNAi flies respectively to test whether DmDuox over-expression can rescue the effects on gut bacterial burden. The gut bacterial burden was significantly decreased in the DmDuox-rescued DmArrestin-RNAi Drosophila, compared to that in the gut of DmArrestin RNAi flies (Supplementary Fig. 16a,b).

In hematophagous insects such as mosquitoes, gut commensal bacteria proliferate rapidly during blood meal digestion. We investigated the correlation between the Mesh-mediated Duox expression and the microbiome load in the Aedes gut following a blood meal. The gut microbiome load increased drastically reaching a peak at about 30 hours post blood feeding (Fig. 5a). The expression levels of AaMesh, AaArrestins and AaDuox were also significantly and progressively upregulated after blood feeding, coinciding with the microbiome expansion (Fig. 5b–e). Silencing AaMesh completely abolished the induction of AaDuox expression after a blood meal (Fig. 5f).

In addition to commensal gut bacteria, the gut epithelia may be also face infected by pathogenic bacteria. We next determined the role of Mesh-Duox axis in response to pathogen infection. A Drosophila pathogen, Erwinia carotovora carotovora 15 (Ecc15), was fed to both DmMesh RNAi and control flies. Since Ecc15 can trigger a strong systemic immune response following oral infection32, the DmDuox gene was dramatically up-regulated in the midgut of both DmMesh RNAi and control flies (Supplementary Fig. 20). These data suggest that the Mesh-Duox axis may only play a fine-tuning role in conventional condition (Fig. 6g).

The quantity and quality of the gut symbiotic bacteria fluctuate dynamically with gut activities such as alimentary flow, food ingestion and other physiological changes36. The host senses these changes and fine-tunes its gut immune system to respond with proper strength and duration to the dynamic changes in commensal microbes. In mammals, ROS plays an important role in controlling the normal gut microbiota. The previous studies indicated that Duox2, an important source of hydrogen peroxide, can be induced by normal gut microbiota in mice37. In addition to Duox2-induced ROS generation, NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) also acts as a key player for ROS responses in the murine intestine, particularly induced by members of the genus Lactobacillus31, revealing an important role of commensal bacteria-mediated ROS generation in maintenance of homeostasis in the mammalian intestine.

The current findings suggest that Mesh-mediated Duox induction is a bacterium-specific response. However, three important questions remain unanswered: 1) is this pathway responsive to all the commensal bacteria or specific classes? 2) how does Mesh sense bacteria, the bacterial surface PAMPs or secreted metabolites? and 3) is this pathway applicable to the mammalian system? Addressing these questions in our future endeavors may not only provide a complete picture of delicate interactions between microbiota and host, but also a conceptual advancement in general.

Aedes aegypti (the Rockefeller strain) was maintained in the laboratory in a low-temperature illuminated incubator (model 818, Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA) at 26°C and 80% humidity according to standard rearing procedures23,42. The 5-day old female mosquitoes were used for the experiment. D. melanogaster were maintained on standard cornmeal-agar medium at 25°C in 60% relative humidity. Drosophila S2 cells were cultured at 28°C in Schneider’s Drosophila medium, which was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, and 100 U/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Both C. testosteroni and C. meningosepticum from the midguts of A. aegypti, and A. thailandicus from the midguts of D. melanogaster were isolated, and subsequently cultured on LB plates without any antibiotics at 37°C.

A fragment of the AaMesh gene (2980 bp-3522 bp) was amplified from A. aegypti cDNA and cloned into a pET-28a (+) expression vector. The cloning primers are presented in Supplementary Table 6. The recombinant peptide was expressed in the E. coli BL21 DE3 strain, with the insoluble form in inclusion bodies. The proteins were resolved with 8 M urea and purified using a purification kit (Clontech, Cat. No# 635515). Polyclonal antibodies were produced by 3 boosting immunizations in C57BL/6 mice. The antibodies for the phosphorylated DmERK and DmJNK were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Cat. No# M9692) and Thermo Fisher (Cat. No# MA5-14943), respectively. These antibodies for DmERK and DmJNK can efficiently detect the phosphorylated AaERK and AaJNK in A. aegypti. The antibodies for the tags were purchased from the Medical & Biological Lab (MBL, Japan).

DmMesh was amplified from the Drosophila cDNA library and then cloned into the pAc5.1-V5/His A vector (Invitrogen, Cat. No# V4110-20). The GFP gene was cloned into the same plasmid as a mock control. The recombinant plasmids were designated pAc-DmMesh and pAc-GFP, respectively. For gene silencing study, the dsRNA was synthesized as previously described43. The S2 cells were seeded at 2×106 cells/mL per well in a 6-well plate. Then, dsRNA or recombinant plasmids were premixed with Effectene® (Qiagen, Cat. No# 301425), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and consequently used for transfection.

The synthesis of dsRNA was performed as previously described43. The primers are shown in Supplementary Table 6. We described the detailed procedures used for gene silencing in mosquitoes elsewhere23,42,43. Briefly, the mosquitoes were cold-anesthetized on a cold tray (BioQuip, USA), and 1 μg/300 nl of dsRNA was subsequently microinjected into the mosquito thoraxes. The injected mosquitoes were allowed to recover under standard rearing conditions and were used for the subsequent investigations.

Using a two-component CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting system44, a Mesh mutation line with mutations and deletions was generated via the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Briefly, we co-injected Cas9-mRNA and Mesh-specific gRNAs into w1118 early embryos. The recovered male F0 flies were then crossed to w; atm/TM6B.Act5c-GFP flies to obtain the F1 progeny with germline-transmitted mutations. It was balanced with a GFP-expressing Tm6B balancer to distinguish homozygous DmMesh−/− flies from heterozygous flies. The mutation in the Mesh locus was consequentially verified by PCR and DNA sequencing45. Primers used for gRNA, PCR and sequencing are listed in Supplementary Table 6.

Drosophila DmMesh RNAi (VDRC, Cat. No# 108297), DmArrestin-1 RNAi (VDRC, Cat. No# 109860), and DmArrestin-2 RNAi (VDRC, Cat. No# 20989) lines were provided by the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center. DmERK RNAi (THFC, Cat. No# THU5780), DmJNK RNAi (THFC, Cat. No# THU1781), DmDuox RNAi (THFC, Cat. No# THU1093), DmNox RNAi (THFC, Cat. No# THU0880) and Ubi-GAL4 (THFC, Cat. No# TB00152) were obtained from the Tsinghua Fly Center (THFC, Beijing, China). UAS-GFP RNAi (VDRC, Cat. No# 41557) was purchased from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (Bloomington, IN, USA) and NP3084 (DGRC, Cat. No# 113094) was purchased from the KYOTO Stock Center (DGRC) (KYOTO, Japan).

The entire open reading frame of the DmDuox-cDNA were subcloned into the pWALIUM20 vector46 to obtain the UAS-DmDuox-cDNA construct, respectively. These constructs were then used to generate transgenic rescue flies through the φC31-mediated recombination between attB and the corresponding pseudo attP sites. The UAS-DmDuox-cDNA was built on the second chromosome. The transgenic flies (UAS-DmDuox-cDNA) were used to rescue the phenotypic defects of DmMesh RNAi, DmArrestin-1 RNAi and DmArrestin-2 RNAi flies, respectively. In briefly, the transgenic flies with DmDuox over-expression (UAS-DmDuox-cDNA strain) were used to crossed with UAS-DmMesh-RNAi flies to obtain the final strains carrying one copy of the UAS-DmMesh-RNAi construct with one copy of the UAS-DmDuox-cDNA. As well, we obtained the final strains carrying one copy of either DmArrestin-1 RNAi or DmArrestin-2 RNAi construct with one copy of the UAS-DmDuox-cDNA flies.

To generate germ-free flies, eggs were washed in sterile deionized water, immersed in 2.7% sodium hypochlorite solution for 2 minutes. Embryos were subsequently washed twice in 70% ethanol, followed by three washes with sterile water. Embryos were transferred to axenic standard fly food vials for rearing. The bacteria cells, which were collected in exponential growth phase, were mixed with the standard Drosophila food to feed the germ-free flies.

Mosquitoes were treated using cotton balls moistened with a 10% sucrose solution including 20 units of penicillin and 20 μg of streptomycin per milliliter for 3 days47,48. Then, the mosquitoes were starved for 24 hours to allow the antibiotics metabolized prior to bacterial challenge. The mosquitoes were decontaminated in 70% ethanol and rinsed in sterile PBS, and the midguts were dissected under aseptic conditions. The removal of the microbes was confirmed by qPCR using a universal bacteria primer27 and a colony forming units (CFU) assay12. We furthermore used the specific primers12 for C. testosteroni, C. meningosepticum and S. marcescens, which are found to be ones of most abundant cultivable bacteria species in the A. aegypti midgut12, to ensure the removal by antibiotic treatment. After the antibiotic treatment, the mosquitoes were fed a mixture containing either C. testosteroni or C. meningosepticum with fresh mouse blood (1:1 v/v) via the Hemotek® feeding system (6W1, Hemotek Limited, England). All supplies used in the mosquito feeding experiment (feeders, membrane, tips, etc.) were aseptic. The bacteria-fed mosquitoes were sacrificed for the gut isolation at several hours after blood feeding. Because of the short time interval, the mosquitoes will not receive a new portion of food that may introduce bacterial contamination.

To determine the number of acquired bacteria in the gut of individual insect, a serial numbers of bacteria was exploited to feed the antibiotic-treated mosquitoes or germ-free flies. Twelve fed insects in each group were randomly selected for the gut isolation under aseptic conditions, and were ground in sterile PBS. The lysates of different dilutions were applied on LB plates without antibiotics. After overnight culture at 37°C, the number of bacteria on the plate was counted to calculate the number of acquired bacteria by per insect. For acquired bacteria counting in the mosquito midguts, a serial number of either C. testosteroni or C. meningosepticum (0.5 OD, 5 OD and 50 OD) were exploited to feed the antibiotic-treated mosquitoes. Twelve fed mosquitoes in each group were randomly selected for the gut isolation, and subsequently we did a bacterial count using a CFU assay. The number of bacteria ingested by a mosquito was approximately 5.4×105 cells in 0.5 OD, 4.3×106 cells in 5 OD, and 3.7×107 cells in 50 OD C. testosteroni-fed mosquitoes, and 5.2×105 cells in 0.5 OD, 8.3×106 cells in 5 OD, and 9.6×107 cells in 50 OD C. meningosepticum-fed mosquitoes (Supplementary Fig. 18a,b). For bacteria counting in the fly guts, a serial amounts of A. thailandicus (1 OD, 50 OD and 250 OD), gradually mixed with the standard Drosophila food respectively, was exploited to feed the germ-free flies. Twelve fed flies in each group were randomly selected to isolate the guts for bacterial counting. The quantity of bacteria ingested by a fly was approximately 4.4×104 cells in 1 OD, 6.0×106 cells in 50 OD, and 4.9×108 cells in 250 OD bacteria-fed flies (Supplementary Fig. 18c).

The insect surface was sterilized with 70% ethanol and washed twice with sterile PBS. The guts of mosquitoes or flies were carefully removed from the abdomen into PBS buffer, and ground adequately under aseptic conditions to reduce contamination from surrounding bacteria. The gut lysates were plated on LB plate without antibiotics, and cultured at 37°C. We identified C. testosteroni, C. meningosepticum from Aedes aegypti, and A. thailandicus from Drosophila melanogaster.

The total RNA of the guts was extracted from the sample with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat. No# 74106). cDNA was randomly reverse-transcribed by an iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Cat. No# 1708891). A commercial matrix was used for qPCR assay (Bio-Rad Cat. No#172-5121). The 16S rRNA was amplified using universal primers27 and bacterial specific primers12. The burden of the gut microbiome was normalized to A. aegypti actin (AAEL011197) or D. melanogaster actin (CG12051).

The insect guts were dissected in PBS with 2 mg/ml of the catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (A8056-10G, Sigma) at different time points. After homogenization, the samples were filtered through a spin filter with a 10K molecular weight cutoff (Corning, Corning Spin-XUF, Cat. No# 431486). The eluate from each experimental group was then collected and tested using a hydrogen peroxide assay kit (BioVision, Cat. No# K265-200). The fluorescence intensity was measured at an excitation wavelength of 550 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm using a fluorescence microplate reader according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The mosquito midguts were dissected in PBS containing the catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (A8056, Sigma). Immediately after dissection, the midguts were incubated with 2 μM dihydroethidium (DHE) (D7008, Sigma) in PBS at RT for 30 min in the dark. Then, the midguts were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min and incubated for an additional 30 min with Triton X-100. Nuclei were stained blue with To-Pro-3 iodide (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Cat. No# T3605). Slides were imaged using a 10×objective lens on a Zeiss LSM 780 meta confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) in a multi-track mode.

The dyes Blue dye no. 1 or Red dye no. 40 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (2.5% wt/vol) were premixed with Drosophila standard food respectively. Flies were reared on the medium with dyes for 12 hours. The dissemination of dyes were subsequently recorded in the fed Drosophila bodies.

Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Ambion Cat. No# 15596018) from pools of 60 midguts of the AaMesh dsRNA-inoculated (Day 3 and Day 6) and AaMesh antiserum-fed (18 hours) female A. aegypti mosquitoes. The samples were delivered to the Beijing Genomics Institute (Shenzhen, China) for commercial RNA-Seq services and data analysis. Clean reads were mapped to the A. aegypti transcript database using SOAPaligner/SOAP2 mismatches. The number of clean reads for each gene was calculated and then normalized to Reads per Kb per Million reads (RPKM), which associates read numbers with gene expression levels. The log2 ratio (read number in AaMesh-suppressed midgut/read number in control midgut) was exploited to determine gene regulation. Immune genes with log2 ratio ≤ −0.4 were selected for further analysis38,48. A rigorous algorithm was used to screen for differentially expressed genes in each group. The sequencing data were deposited in the Short Read Archive (NCBI) with accession number GSE79070.

Animals were randomly allocated into different groups. Mosquitoes and flies that died before measurement were excluded from analysis. The investigators were not blinded to the allocation during the experiments or to the outcome assessment. Descriptive statistics have been provided in the figure legends. Given the nature of the experiments and the type of samples, differences in continuous variables were assessed with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism statistical software.
