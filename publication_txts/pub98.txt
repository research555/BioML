Functional diversity of microbial ecologies estimated from ancient human coprolites and dental calculus



Human microbiome studies are increasingly incorporating macroecological approaches, such as community assembly, network analysis and functional redundancy to more fully characterize the microbiome. Such analyses have not been applied to ancient human microbiomes, preventing insights into human microbiome evolution. We address this issue by analysing published ancient microbiome datasets: coprolites from Rio Zape (n = 7; 700 CE Mexico) and historic dental calculus (n = 44; 1770–1855 CE, UK), as well as two novel dental calculus datasets: Maya (n = 7; 170 BCE-885 CE, Belize) and Nuragic Sardinians (n = 11; 1400–850 BCE, Italy). Periodontitis-associated bacteria (Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Eubacterium saphenum) were identified as keystone taxa in the dental calculus datasets. Coprolite keystone taxa included known short-chain fatty acid producers (Eubacterium biforme, Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens) and potentially disease-associated bacteria (Escherichia, Brachyspira). Overlap in ecological profiles between ancient and modern microbiomes was indicated by similarity in functional response diversity profiles between contemporary hunter–gatherers and ancient coprolites, as well as parallels between ancient Maya, historic UK, and modern Spanish dental calculus; however, the ancient Nuragic dental calculus shows a distinct ecological structure. We detected key ecological signatures from ancient microbiome data, paving the way to expand understanding of human microbiome evolution.

This article is part of the theme issue ‘Insights into health and disease from ancient biomolecules’.

Host-associated microbiomes are complex ecosystems with diverse sets of interactions between microbes, the host and abiotic features. Human microbiome research has primarily focused on documenting the genes/organisms present in a sample and differentiating microbiome communities using presence/absence and relative abundance data [1–5]. Such contributions have undoubtedly advanced the understanding of human biology; however, a stronger focus on taxonomic co-occurrence, identification of taxa with disproportionate influence on community function, as well as overall resilience of metabolic pathways will provide a more nuanced view of the microbiome. An analogy can be drawn from mammalian ecology in the United States’ Yellowstone National Park, where a focus on the role that wolves play as a keystone species yields greater clarification on cross-species interactions and dependencies. Wolves are not an abundant species in the ecosystem, yet their predator–prey relationships have tremendous downstream impacts on ecosystem production and stability [6–8]. A simple taxonomic inventory does not present the full picture of the wolves’ impact on the ecosystem, but an approach focused on their network of interactions demonstrates how they function as a keystone species that reshapes resource allocation and alters interspecies relationships throughout the ecosystem [6–8]. In the absence of deeper modelling, wolves would remain a rare biome variant, without a sophisticated understanding of their role as a keystone species.

Here, we present an ecologically focused analysis on previously published Rio Zape human coprolites (n = 8, 700 CE) [41,57] and historical dental calculus samples from the Radcliffe Infirmary Burial Ground, UK (n = 44, 1770–1855 CE) [63], as well as novel metagenomic dental calculus data generated as part of this study (see the electronic supplementary material, Methods) from Maya individuals from Belize (n = 7, 170 BCE-885 CE) and Nuragic individuals from Sardinia, Italy (n = 11, 1400–850 BCE). To best adapt ecological approaches to ancient coprolites and dental calculus, we focused on analysing the structure and properties of microbiome networks, identification of keystone taxa and functional diversity of specific functions of interest. Each of these can be evaluated without time-series data. Compositionally, corrected networks using SparCC [64] were generated following the protocol suggested by Layeghifard et al. [65] using species-level bacterial taxonomic inventories from MetaPhlAn2 [66]. Each network was generated 100 times to estimate network properties (number of clusters, modularity, transitivity and articulation points). Modularity and transitivity values were categorized as very low, low, medium, high and very high based on the distribution modularity and transitivity values across the different networks we generated. Keystone taxa were identified using three techniques common to network evaluation: page rank [67,68], hubs [69,70] and closeness centrality [71,72]. Functional redundancy was evaluated with gene-level inventories generated by HUMAnN2 [73] using the UniRef [50,74] database. Finally, we compared the results from the ancient datasets to modern human microbiome datasets to evaluate our ability to take a deeper ecological approach with the former as well as to identify possible changes in microbiome structure and resilience between ancient and modern microbiomes. A more in-depth discussion of our methods and the techniques used for network analysis and keystone taxa identification can be found in the electronic supplementary material.

We find a mean of 2.09 clusters (table 1) across the network for the Rio Zape coprolites (figure 1). Taking a broader view of network properties, the low modularity (mean = 0.11) in the Rio Zape network, indicates that the two clusters are highly interconnected. Similarly, the high transitivity (mean = 0.67) demonstrates that nodes are highly connected to each other outside of central nodes. Eubacterium biforme and Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens were identified as potential keystone species in each of the approaches used to discover keystones (table 2). Reads mapping to each keystone taxon were authenticated as ancient using MapDamage 2.0 [75,76] (electronic supplementary material, figure S1a–d). Escherichia and Brachyspira were also identified as keystone taxa; however, species-level resolution could not be obtained. Using MetaPhlAn2, we determined the presence of gut-associated members of these genera, such as Escherichia coli and Brachyspira pilosicoli, respectively, in addition to other unclassified species.

The functional roles of these keystones were interpreted by identifying the top 50 most abundant genes found in each taxon. Each keystone taxon has a high abundance of typical housekeeping genes, such as genes involved in synthesis of ribosomal RNA, transferases and transcriptional regulators (electronic supplementary material, table S1). We also identified genes involved in antibiotic-resistance mechanisms (MATE efflux proteins in Brachyspira, E. biforme, and P. succinatutens, and acriflavin-resistance proteins in Brachyspira and P. succinatutens). Toxin-antitoxin proteins were abundant in Escherichia, and transposases were abundant in all the keystone taxa (electronic supplementary material, table S1).

We used a gene-centric approach to evaluate functional redundancy and response diversity as estimators of resilience in the coprolite microbiome. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, butyrate and propionate, are critical for maintaining a properly functioning human gut microbiome [77–79] and therefore are an intuitive starting point for investigating gene-level functional diversity. We focused our analysis on three SCFA synthesis genes: acetate kinase (acetate), butyrate kinase (butyrate) and methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (propionate). We observe higher diversity for acetate kinase in species richness (p-value <4 × 10−7), phylogenetic diversity (p-value <2 × 10−9) and Gini-Simpson (p-value <0.003) (figure 2a–c). These results point towards high response diversity (high number of phylogenetically diverse species) and more evenly distributed production for the taxa encoding acetate kinase, resulting in functionally redundant production of acetate kinase in the Rio Zape coprolites. Butyrate kinase and methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase are similar to each other in species richness and phylogenetic diversity (p-value >0.05), while Gini-Simpson is higher for taxa encoding butyrate kinase (p-value <0.03). Higher Gini-Simpson index values for butyrate production, compared to propionate, suggests a more even distribution of taxa encoding butyrate kinase and therefore greater protection against shifts in taxonomic abundance that may ultimately cause a decrease in propionate production.

Shotgun metagenomic data were generated for Maya individuals (n = 7) and Nuragic individuals (n = 11). SourceTracker2 [80] analysis showed preservation of the oral microbiome signature in all samples, as evidenced by the proportion of reads attributed to taxa commonly found in subgingival or supragingival plaque (electronic supplementary material, figure S2).

The two archaeological populations show similar network properties: the Maya population (figure 3a) shows an average of 2.64 clusters, modularity of 0.052 and transitivity of 0.822. The Nuragic population (figure 3b) shows 2.71 clusters, modularity of 0.102 and transitivity of 0.704 (table 1). Modularity is significantly higher in the Nuragic population (p-value <2 × 10−16) and transitivity is higher in the Maya population (p-value <2 × 10−16), yet overall, both populations show very low or low modularity and very high transitivity compared to other networks generated in our analysis (table 3). Low modularity values are consistent with a network that has highly interconnected clusters; the clusters lack independence. Similarly, the high transitivity values reflect the diverse paths to connect the bacterial species in each network, providing further evidence of high interconnectivity in the network. The historical Radcliffe population (figure 3c) has significantly more clusters (14.1) compared to the Maya (2.64) and Nuragic (2.71) populations (p-value <2 × 10−16), which is probably driven by higher sample size in the Radcliffe dataset (see Sample Size Simulation section in Results). Despite this, the Radcliffe dataset is similar to the archaeological dental calculus in having very low modularity and very high transitivity (table 1).

The keystone species identified in each population are known oral taxa (table 2). Reads mapping to these taxa were authenticated as ancient for the Maya and Nuragic datasets on the basis of DNA damage patterns, generated using MapDamage 2.0 (electronic supplementary material, figures S3 and S4), suggesting that the networks represent an accurate ancient oral ecology. Additionally, keystone species were consistent regardless of analytical approach used (table 2). Taxa associated with periodontitis progression were identified as keystone in each of the populations: Treponema socranskii and T. forsythia in Radcliffe, Eubacterium saphenum and Olsenella sp. in Nuragic Sardinians, and Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola in Maya. Cardiobacterium valvarum was also identified as a keystone in the Maya population.

We next evaluated the co-occurrence patterns of selected taxa of interest: early colonizing bacteria Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus sanguinis and Actinomyces naeslundii [13,81,82], as well as periodontitis-associated bacteria T. forsythia, T. denticola and P. gingivalis [13,83–86]. These bacteria were chosen to study cluster co-occurrence because they play an important role in ecological interactions and functions; early colonizers are among the first bacteria to colonize the dental surface and periodontitis-associated bacteria can shift the community to a disease state. We documented how often common members of the oral microbiome are found in the same cluster as each taxon of interest (electronic supplementary material, figure S5). In the Maya and Radcliffe populations, early colonizers like S. gordonii and S. sanguinis co-occur in the same cluster as the periodontitis-associated bacteria T. forsythia and T. denticola. In the Nuragic population, we observed a similar trend but S. gordonii does not co-occur with the other oral taxa and another early colonizer, A. naeslundii, appears to take S. gordonii's place. Actinomyces naeslundii does not co-occur with the above-mentioned oral taxa in the Maya and Radcliffe populations.

Similar to the coprolites, the most abundant genes encoded by the keystones identified in each of the dental calculus samples include transporters, transferases and ribosomal proteins. Efflux-related proteins linked to antibiotic-resistance (MATE efflux and RND efflux) were identified as highly abundant genes in each of the Maya and Radcliffe keystones, but in neither of the Nuragic keystone taxa (electronic supplementary material, tables S2–S4). The Nuragic keystones both encode putative pathogenic genes: bacteriocin in E. saphenum and virulence activator in Olsenella. Fusobacterium nucleatum in the Maya samples was the only other keystone found to encode similar genes (haemolysin and ethanolamine utilization). Finally, the keystones C. valvarum (Maya), T. denticola (Maya) and Olsenella (Nuragic Sardinians) were found to encode toxin-antitoxin genes and other stress-response genes in high abundance.

For gene-centric analyses, we focused on proteins involved in dental calculus formation via cell-cell binding (adhesins, flagellar and fimbrial proteins) [59] to give a better understanding of the functional redundancy of proteins involved in dental calculus formation. The Radcliffe and Maya populations have α diversity similar profiles for each binding protein and metric, while the Nuragic population has significantly lower richness than both Radcliffe and Maya populations for each gene (p-value <0.04; figure 4a). The Nuragic population has significantly lower phylogenetic diversity for every gene (p-value <0.0005) and Gini-Simpson for fimbrial and flagellum genes (p-value <0.0008) compared to Radcliffe (figure 4b,c). The Maya population has significantly greater phylogenetic diversity for fimbrial genes (p-value <0.003) and greater Gini-Simpson for adhesin and flagellum genes (p-value <0.03) as compared to the Nuragic Sardinians (figure 4b,c).

Neither the coprolites nor dental calculus networks have articulation points. This is probably related to the low modularity in the networks: the interconnectivity of clusters within each network makes it likely for clusters to be connected to each other through multiple nodes.

The coprolite and dental calculus networks inform about general properties (numbers of clusters, connectedness, and articulation points) and identify keystone species. We compared these data to modern microbiome datasets to assess the viability of ancient networks. The Rio Zape coprolites were compared to modern faecal microbiome datasets that represent hunter–gatherers (Hadza [87] and Matses [88]) and industrialized populations (MetaHIT-China [89] and Human Microbiome Project [90]). The ancient dental calculus was compared to modern Spanish dental calculus [63]. It is important to compare ancient dental calculus to modern dental calculus and not modern dental plaque, as dental calculus is distinct from dental plaque in maturation stage and ecology [63]. The small number of datasets mean that broad interpretations may be limited but it is a useful practice, nonetheless. The coprolite dataset showed fewer numbers of clusters (p-value <2 × 10−16), lower modularity (p-value <2 × 10−16), and higher transitivity (p-value <2 × 10−16) than modern faecal datasets (table 3). Unlike the low modularity and high transitivity found in the Rio Zape coprolites, the modern faecal microbiome networks had medium to very high modularity and low to very low transitivity (table 3). Both the modern and ancient dental calculus datasets each have low to very low modularity and high to very high transitivity, while a high number of clusters is only found in the Radcliffe ancient dental calculus dataset (table 3). The Human Microbiome Project faecal microbiome network was the only network that had articulation points. Keystone taxa were not shared between ancient and modern datasets, except for P. succinatutens serving as a keystone in the Rio Zape coprolites and modern Hadza hunter–gatherers.

The Spanish modern dental calculus had higher α diversity for all genes of interest in each metric when compared to the prehistoric Nuragic dental calculus (p-value <0.05) (electronic supplementary material, figure S6d–f). Likewise, the modern dental calculus had greater richness than the Radcliffe and Maya populations (p-value <0.012), with the exception of taxa encoding flagella in the Maya population. The modern dental calculus had significantly higher phylogenetic diversity than the Maya and Radcliffe datasets for fimbrial production (p-value <0.006) (electronic supplementary material, figure S6e) but there were no significant differences between the Radcliffe, Maya, and modern dental calculus in Gini-Simpson (electronic supplementary material, figure S6f).

Most archaeological sites will provide small sample sizes. In our study, to address the effect of sample size on uncovering ecological interactions from human microbiomes, we simulated the effect of small sample size using modern GI tract microbiome data (see the electronic supplementary material, Methods). In brief, we randomly subsampled five, 10 and 20 samples from each dataset, then filtered taxa and generated the networks in the same way as we did for the full datasets. We found that both the number of clusters (r2 = 0.91) and network distinctness ratio (r2 = 0.88) increase with sample size (electronic supplementary material, table S5 and figure S7a,b). A high network distinctness ratio means high modularity and low transitivity, and therefore increased sample size leads to more clusters that are highly distinct from each other. We performed the same small sample size simulation with the Radcliffe ancient dental calculus dataset, which was our only dental calculus dataset with more than 20 samples. Similar to the faecal microbiome datasets, the number of clusters increased with sample size (r2 = 0.94); however, there was no increase in the network distinctness ratio (r2 = 0.52) (electronic supplementary material, figure S7a,b), indicating there are more clusters but those clusters are still highly interconnected. For both the faecal microbiomes and dental calculus, the keystones found in the full sample dataset were not found in any of the five-sample datasets and only rarely found in the 10-sample datasets (electronic supplementary material, table S6 and figure S8). The keystones identified in the 20-sample dataset were similar to the keystones found in the full datasets (electronic supplementary material, table S6 and figure S8).

The gene-specific approaches do not appear to be hindered by small sample size. As discussed above, we observed similar profiles between modern faecal datasets (Hadza, n = 26 and Matses, n = 25) and small coprolite datasets (Rio Zape = 8), as well as similar profiles between large ancient dental calculus datasets (Radcliffe, n = 44) and small ancient and modern dental calculus datasets (Maya, n = 7 and Spain, n = 10). Therefore, analysis of functional diversity in ancient human microbiome datasets remains robust even when few samples are recovered archaeologically.

Archaeologists have made use of coprolites and dental calculus to study human biology, nutrition, and cultural behavior [38–40,42,43,58,92]. Applying ecological approaches to ancient human microbiomes from these materials is a clear next step to provide a deeper understanding of biology in the past. As research on modern human microbiome ecology is still in its infancy, it is expected that ancient microbiome ecology research will lag behind, but it should not be ignored. We have found that by focusing on ecological elements that can be interpreted from single time-point samples, such as ecological network properties, clusters of bacteria, keystone species, functional redundancy and response diversity, we can gain a glimpse of ecological interactions and functional diversity in ancient human microbiomes.

A greater interest in the maturing of ecological theory for microbiomes is needed, but applying such theory effectively requires a serious investment in mitigating ascertainment biases that burden current reference databases. Publicly available reference databases are skewed towards microbiomes from modern, industrial settings, of often health-associated microbiomes, which bias functional annotation of ancient and non-industrial studies. This ascertainment bias explains why we observe high taxonomic diversity for the industrialized gut microbiome datasets and provide at least a partial explanation of ‘unknown' reads in ancient dental calculus results. Our functional diversity approach relies on mapping to marker genes identified from reference taxa. Poor reference representation from non-industrialized populations will lead to bacterial genes and taxa being missed and categorized as ‘unknown'. Future microbiome initiatives must avoid exacerbating these biases, with an attention to data that informs, and contextualizes, the microbial ecology.
