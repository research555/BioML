The gut microbiome of exudivorous marmosets in the wild and captivity

Mammalian captive dietary specialists like folivores are prone to gastrointestinal distress and primate dietary specialists suffer the greatest gut microbiome diversity losses in captivity compared to the wild. Marmosets represent another group of dietary specialists, exudivores that eat plant exudates, but whose microbiome remains relatively less studied. The common occurrence of gastrointestinal distress in captive marmosets prompted us to study the Callithrix gut microbiome composition and predictive function through bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA V4 region sequencing. We sampled 59 wild and captive Callithrix across four species and their hybrids. Host environment had a stronger effect on the gut microbiome than host taxon. Wild Callithrix gut microbiomes were enriched for Bifidobacterium, which process host-indigestible carbohydrates. Captive marmoset guts were enriched for Enterobacteriaceae, a family containing pathogenic bacteria. While gut microbiome function was similar across marmosets, Enterobacteriaceae seem to carry out most functional activities in captive host guts. More diverse bacterial taxa seem to perform gut functions in wild marmosets, with Bifidobacterium being important for carbohydrate metabolism. Captive marmosets showed gut microbiome composition aspects seen in human gastrointestinal diseases. Thus, captivity may perturb the exudivore gut microbiome, which raises implications for captive exudivore welfare and calls for husbandry modifications.

The mammalian gut microbiome plays an important role in host physiology1,2, and microbiome dysbiosis is thought to negatively impact host health3–5. More closely related hosts seem to share more similar microbiome communities than more distantly related hosts (i.e., phylosymbiosis)6,7, and gut microbiome communities are usually enriched for bacteria associated with the main macronutrients of a host’s feeding strategy8–12. Yet, environmental factors significantly alter individual host microbiomes10,12, as evidenced by differences in microbiome composition between wild and captive conspecifics across a variety of animal taxa13–19. Gut microbiome studies of captive and wild mammals show that non-human primates (NHPs) experience relatively large losses of native gut microbiome diversity in captivity compared to the wild5,13. Additionally, dietary specialist NHPs including folivores (leaf-eating) and frugo-folivores (fruit and leaf-eating) are especially prone to gastrointestinal problems in captivity20–24. Among humans and NHPs, dysbiosis in gut microbiome composition has been tied to gastrointestinal diseases4,22,25.

Here, we determine gut microbiome profiles of Callithrix sampled in and out of captivity throughout Brazil. We applied 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) V4 region amplicon sequencing of Callithrix gut microbiota, and investigated gut microbiome composition and gut microbiome predictive functional profiles. Anal swabs were sampled in Brazil from 59 healthy individuals of four species and three hybrid types (Table 1) that were either wild, translocated into captivity from the wild, or born into captivity (Fig. 1). Our specific aims in this study were to evaluate the influence of host taxon and environment on Callithrix gut microbiome composition, diversity, and function. As marmosets are considered obligate exudivores27, we hypothesize that marmoset gut microbiome composition and predictive functional profiles are strongly biased toward carbohydrate metabolism across marmoset taxa. Yet, as previous studies have shown differences in gut microbiome composition between wild and captive animal hosts5,13, we hypothesize that Callithrix gut microbiome composition between individual hosts differs according to host environmental status (i.e., captive, translocated, wild).

We collected anal swabs between 2015 and 2016 from 59 adult individuals, and general sampling information is summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 1. Supplementary Table S1 gives detailed information on each sampled marmoset host including taxon, sampling location, and environment. We considered marmosets older than 11 months as adults, following age criteria based on dental characteristics and genitalia growth43. Marmoset sampling was authorized and approved by the Brazilian Environmental Ministry (SISBIO protocol# 47964-2), and the Arizona State University IACUC (protocol# 15-144R). Wild animals were captured with Tomahawk style traps baited with bananas. As part of a larger marmoset ’omics’ study (e.g.31), sampled animals were immobilized with ketamine (10 mg/kg of body weight) through inner thigh intramuscular injection, photographed, weighed, measured, examined clinically by veterinarians, and deemed healthy upon examination. Copan FLOQ Swabs were gently rotated in the anal region and submerged in storage buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 50 mM EDTA, 50 mM Sucrose, 100 mM NaCl, 1% SDS) before being discarded. After processing, animals were returned to cages for recovery. Wild marmosets were released at original capture sites. Host taxon identification followed previously published phenotype descriptions44,45 and personal observations by JM and CSI. Hosts were also classified by their environment as wild (captured as free-range individuals), translocated (born wild but later put into captivity), or captive (born and raised in captivity). This study is reported in accordance to ARRIVE guidelines (https://arriveguidelines.org/resources/questionnaire). All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant international guidelines and regulations.

Bacterial DNA extraction from Callithrix anal swabs was carried out by following a modified phenol-chloroform protocol46. Modifications included beating the samples on a vortex fitted with a horizontal vortex adaptor (#13000-V1-24, Mo Bio, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 10 min at step “2Aiii,” precipitating samples in 100% ethanol in step “2Axvi” and rehydrating DNA pellets in 25 
μ
L low TE buffer at step “2Axxii.” Extracted DNA was quantified on a Qubit3 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with a dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies). DNA samples obtained for this study have been registered in the Brazilian SISGen database under entries # A2E885E, A965629, A5CB6FA, AE784B5, and A07A291. The V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from sampled DNA in triplicate using the barcoded primer set 515f/806r47. Amplicon triplicates were combined for each individual and then pooled in equimolar amounts into a multiplexed Illumina sequencing library. The library was purified with a Zymo DNA Concentrator and Cleaner-5 (#D4013, Zymo Research, Irving, CA, USA) and size selected for 375–380 base pairs with Agencourt Ampure XP (#A63880, Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) magnetic beads. Libraries were sequenced at Arizona State University, USA on an Illumina MiSeq for2x250 cycles.

Code for bioinformatics analysis described below is available at http://github.com/Callithrix-omics/callithrix_microbiome. Data were demultiplexed using default parameters in QIIME2-2021.248. The DADA2 QIIME2 plug-in49 was used to quality-filter and trim sequences and join paired-end reads. Upon trimming, the first 10 and last 30 nucleotides were removed from reverse reads due to low base quality. These steps resulted in feature tables of DNA sequences and their per-sample counts. MAAFT50 and FastTree51, as part of the QIIME2 phylogeny plug-in, aligned and produced a mid-pointed rooted phylogenetic tree of feature sequences. Taxonomic composition of samples was determined with the QIIME2 Naive Bayes q2-feature-classifier plug-in, which was trained on pre-formatted SILVA reference sequence and taxonomy files “Silva 138 SSURef NR99 515F/806R region sequences” and “Silva 138 SSURef NR99 515F/806R region taxonomy”52–54 for the portion of the 16S V4 region bounded by the 515F/806R primer pair. The pre-formatted files were downloaded from docs.qiime2.org/2021.4/data-resources. Taxonomic classification of the feature table was carried out with the q2-feature-classifier classify-sklearn command. For further down stream analyses, we used the QIIME2 export option to extract a biom format file from the classified feature table as well as feature table taxonomic information. Information from the exported biom file and feature table taxonomy were merged into a new biom format file with the biom 2.1.1055 command line tool.

BURRITO67, an online interactive visualization module, was used to make links between our bacterial abundance data and predicted functional profiles from the Callithrix gut microbiome. As input, we used bacterial taxonomic abundance and taxonomy data based on the biom file originally extracted from QIIME2. We also provided a function attribution table based on PICRUSt2 output that linked the functional and taxonomic data by following instructions for the convert_table.py script at https://github.com/picrust/picrust2/wiki. We also provided a metadata table to BURRITO which included host environmental classifications. Host taxon information was later superimposed manually on result plots manually in Adobe Illustrator.

After initial processing and filtering of individual marmoset gut microbiome libraries, a total of 10,902,292 sequence reads was obtained with an average of 201,894 (124389.64 ± SD) reads per sample. After quality filtering, 8,885,656 reads remained with an average 164,549.19 (99,524.230 ± SD) reads per sample. Afterward, merging of paired-end sequences produced 8,191,034 reads, with an average of 151,685.81 (91,568.49 ± SD) reads per sample. This information is detailed in Supplementary Table S2.

Boxplots of alpha diversity in terms of marmoset gut microbiome richness for host environment and taxonomic classification, respectively, are shown in Fig. 2a,b. Individual host alpha diversity measures are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The GLM model fitted for the influence of host taxon and environment on marmoset gut microbiome alpha diversity is summarized in Table 2. In the model, post-hoc pairwise host environment comparisons between wild and translocated hosts as well as captive and translocated hosts were highly significant (Supplementary Table S3). For host taxon, respective post-hoc pairwise comparisons between C. aurita and C. jacchus, C. penicillata, and C. jacchus 
×
 C. penicillata were highly significant (Supplementary Table S3). Respective pairwise comparisons between C. jacchus and C. geoffroyi and C. penicillata 
×
 C. geofforyi were also significant (Supplementary Table S3).

For marmoset gut microbiome beta diversity, a NMDS plot of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index with superimposed host environment and taxon is shown in Figure 2c. The effects of host environment on marmoset gut microbiome beta diversity were significant (PERMANOVA, R2=0.09, df=2, p=0.001), while those of host taxon were not (PERMANOVA, R2=0.14, df=6, p=0.06). Post-hoc analysis of all possible combinations of host environmental levels were found to be significant (p-value=0.001).

Figure 3a shows relative abundances of bacterial classes for hosts according to their environmental and taxon classification. These plots show that captive marmosets had relatively high abundance of Gammoproteobacteria (average abundance 60%). Translocated marmosets seem to have relatively high abundance of Campylobacteria (average abundance 36%) . Wild marmosets have an average relative abundance of Campylobacteria of 33% and an Actinobacteria average relative abundance of 41%. For highest gut bacterial abundances among marmoset taxa, Gammaoproteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial class for C. aurita (39%), C. geoffroyi (55%), C. jacchus (72%), and C. penicillata (41%). Campylobacteria was most abundant in C. jacchus 
×
 C. penicillata hybrids (31%), while Actinobacteria was highest in C. penicillata 
×
 C. geofforyi hybrids (44%). Enterobacteriaceae were the most abundant bacterial family in the gut microbiome of captive marmosets (47%). For translocated marmosets, Heliobacter was most abundant in the gut microbiome (28%). Then for wild marmosets, the most abundant bacterial genus in the gut microbiome was Bifidobacterium. LefSe differential gut microbiome bacteria abundance analysis at class and genus levels support the statistical significance of these differences among marmoset hosts (Fig. 3b,c, Supplementary Fig. S2).

A total of 183 KEGG predictive pathways were identified among our sampled marmoset hosts (Supplementary Table S4). Boxplots of KEGG pathways richness of the Callithrix gut microbiome according to host taxon and environment, respectively, are shown in Fig. 4a,b. KEGG pathway richness values for individual hosts are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The GLM fit to explain the effects of host environment and taxon on gut KEGG pathway alpha diversity is summarized in Table 3. Neither host environment nor taxon were significant in the fitted model for having an effect on the alpha diversity of marmoset predicted KEGG pathways of the gut microbiome.

For marmoset gut microbiome KEGG pathway beta diversity, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index values were plotted on a NMDS ordination plot with superimposition of both host environment and taxon (Fig. 4c). Neither the effects of host environment (PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.07, df = 2 p = 0.140) nor host taxon (PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.12, df = 6, p = 0.493) had a significant effect on Callithrix gut predicted KEGG pathway beta diversity.

For relative abundance of predicted KEGG pathways of the Callithrix gut microbiome, sampled marmoset distributions showed an even distribution of KEGG metabolism categories, with carbohydrate metabolism being one of the most abundant categories (Fig. 5a). For relative abundance of predicted KEGG pathways of the Callithrix gut microbiome, sampled marmoset distributions showed an even distribution of KEGG metabolism categories, with carbohydrate metabolism being one of the most abundant categories (Fig. 5a). Visual inspection of the plot shows that this pattern holds regardless of host environmental or taxon categorization. LEfSe analysis for the top significantly enriched predicted KEGG pathways in the marmoset gut is shown for host environment in Fig. 5b and for host taxon in Fig. 5c. All top predicted KEGG gut microbiome pathways were enriched for in captive marmosets. The top most pathway was K01051 (LDA = 4.8) and is involved with carbohydrate metabolism of pectinesterase. This same pathway is also enriched in C. aurita and C. jacchus. The orthology of remaining pathways in Fig. 5b,c is given in Supplementary Table S5.

Linkage analysis between Callithrix gut bacterial taxa and predicted gut microbiome function are shown in Fig. 6 and Supplementary Figures S3 and S4 for major bacterial and functional classes. Visual inspection of the three figures shows overall that different sets of bacterial taxa are responsible for carrying out different gut functional activities between captive and wild marmosets. Actinobacteria take on a number of functional roles in the Callithrix gut microbiome almost exclusively within wild hosts (Supplementary Fig. S3). Bifidobacterium seems especially important among wild marmosets for carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism (Fig. 6a). On the other hand, Proteobacteria seem to be heavily involved across variable major functions in the gut of captive and translocated marmosets (Supplementary Fig. S3). Enterobacteriaceae seem to be carrying out a large number of functional roles, including across major categories of metabolic pathways in captive and translocated marmosets (Fig. 6b). For other classes of bacteria found in the Callithrix gut, Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, and Campilobacterota seem to take on a broad number of functional roles in both translocated and captive marmosets (Supplementary Fig. S4). The latter two also seems to also perform broad gut functional roles in a smaller subset of captive marmoset hosts (Supplementary Fig. S4).

In terms of Callithrix gut microbiome community structure, we found host taxon to significantly influence alpha diversity but not beta diversity. The significant pairwise differences in gut microbiome richness between C. jacchus, C. penicillata, and other marmosets may be related to relative differences for exudivory specialization between Callithrix taxa31. For example, C. aurita showed the lowest gut microbiome richness and is relatively one of the less specialized Callithrix taxa for exudate consumption31. In contrast, C. jacchus and C. penicillata are relatively the most specialized marmosets for gumnivory31, and possessed the highest levels of gut microbiome richness. A recent study of wild lemurs found that microbiomes, metagenomes, and metabolomes were species-specific and attuned to host dietary specializations and associated gastrointestinal morphology68. For Callithrix, a similar systematic study of taxa along a sliding scale of evolutionary specialization for exudivory is necessary to be undertaken with wild marmosets to better understand how host phylogeny influences gut microbiome diversity.

Our major study findings are consistent with previous studies in showing that gut microbiome composition is sensitive to host environmental factors, and that Bifidobacterium may be an important biomarker for marmoset gut microbiome health. We also show that carbohydrate metabolism is a key function of the Callithrix gut microbiome. It will be, nonetheless, important for future studies to further confirm and replicate these findings given some of the inherent limitations of our study. Given our limited sampling of wild marmosets, further studies with expanded sampling of wild individuals representing all Callithrix species are still needed. For microbiome studies of marmosets in captivity, as most previous studies are highly biased towards C. jacchus, future studies also should strive to expand sampling to other marmoset species. Hybridization is also an extremely common occurrence in marmosets, which should be further explored in relation to the marmoset microbiome. As our data set was highly biased toward C. jacchus 
×
 C. penicillata hybrids, expanding sampling other types of free-ranging and captive marmoset hybrids is necessary to move marmoset microbiome studies forward. Our predictive results should be also interpreted cautiously as representation of microorganisms in databases used by microbiome predictive function programs is biased toward those associated with humans and biotechnology90,91. As a result, the inferential power of programs such as PICRUSt2 drops off significantly for non-human microbiome datasets91. Utilizing shotgun whole metagenomic and/or transcriptomic approaches in lieu of 16s rRNA approaches for functional as well as taxonomical microbiome characterization would be one way to significantly increase the inferential power of datasets such as ours92,93. For exudivores in general, more studies are needed to understand better the health and reproductive consequences of omitting as well as increasing gum intake by specialized exudivores in captivity. Overall, such information will expand baseline gut microbiome data available for wild and non-wild exudivores to allow for the development of new tools to improve exudiviore management, welfare, and conservation.
