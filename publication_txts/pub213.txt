A randomization-based causal inference framework for uncovering environmental exposure effects on human gut microbiota

Statistical analysis of microbial genomic data within epidemiological cohort studies holds the promise to assess the influence of environmental exposures on both the host and the host-associated microbiome. However, the observational character of prospective cohort data and the intricate characteristics of microbiome data make it challenging to discover causal associations between environment and microbiome. Here, we introduce a causal inference framework based on the Rubin Causal Model that can help scientists to investigate such environment-host microbiome relationships, to capitalize on existing, possibly powerful, test statistics, and test plausible sharp null hypotheses. Using data from the German KORA cohort study, we illustrate our framework by designing two hypothetical randomized experiments with interventions of (i) air pollution reduction and (ii) smoking prevention. We study the effects of these interventions on the human gut microbiome by testing shifts in microbial diversity, changes in individual microbial abundances, and microbial network wiring between groups of matched subjects via randomization-based inference. In the smoking prevention scenario, we identify a small interconnected group of taxa worth further scrutiny, including Christensenellaceae and Ruminococcaceae genera, that have been previously associated with blood metabolite changes. These findings demonstrate that our framework may uncover potentially causal links between environmental exposure and the gut microbiome from observational data. We anticipate the present statistical framework to be a good starting point for further discoveries on the role of the gut microbiome in environmental health.

Environmental influences on the human gut microbiome are still to be discovered or better understood. In this paper, we contribute to the field of microbiome research and environmental epidemiology by suggesting a stage-based causal inference framework relying on the foundations of the Rubin Causal Model. A particularity of the framework is the use of randomization-based inference, which we value to be a necessary exploratory inference method when tackling untapped research questions. To illustrate the framework, we explore the effects of two inhaled environmental exposures previously hypothesized to be linked with gastrointestinal diseases and the gut microbiome: air pollution exposure and cigarette smoking.

The human microbiome plays a pivotal role in maintaining a healthy physiology via multiple interactions with the host. The gut microbiome, for instance, provides important metabolic capabilities for food digestion [1, 2] and regulates immune homeostasis [3]. Although dietary interventions [4], pathogen infections [5], and antibiotics use [6] can trigger rapid changes of gut microbial compositions and can lead to dysbiotic disruptions of host-microbiome interactions, the long-term impact of environmental exposures on the human gut microbiome remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a causal inference framework for assessing such epidemiological questions and analyze a prospective cohort with collected microbiome data. Recent technological advances, through culture-independent analyses, have facilitated a surge in observational studies of the human microbiome [7–9]. A common method to catalog microbial constituents is high-throughput amplicon sequencing [10], allowing the acquisition of gut microbiome survey data for large prospective cohort studies. Important examples include the Human Microbiome Project [11], the British TwinsUK study [12], the Dutch LifeLines-DEEP [13] and Rotterdam Studies [14], the Chinese Guangdong Gut Microbiome Project [15], the American Gut Project [16], and the German KORA study [17].

In the following, we detail the characteristics of the KORA FF4 study population and highlight potential effects of the hypothetical interventions, air pollution reduction and smoking prevention, on the gut microbiome. In particular, we characterize potential effects in terms of changes in overall microbial diversity, taxon-level abundances, and microbial associations. In the smoking prevention analysis, we identified taxa, including Ruminococcaceae (UCG-005, UCG-003, UCG-002) and Christensenellaceae R-7-group, that are part of a stable sub-community in the microbial association networks and have been found to contribute to circulating blood metabolites in the LifeLines-Deep cohort [65].

The data come from the German KORA FF4 cohort study, which involves participants aged 25 to 74 years old living in the city of Augsburg [17]. The participants were subject to health questionnaires and follow-up examinations. During the study, stool samples were collected and the gut microbiota data for 2,033 participants were obtained with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. For each participant we have their long-term exposure to air pollution (particulate matter). The long-term exposure variables come from the ULTRA III study, in which air pollutants were monitored several times a year at 20 locations within the Augsburg region. From this data, annual averages of air pollutants were calculated using land-use regression models. The models explain the spatial variation of the pollutants with predictor variables derived from geographic information systems (GIS). To obtain the long-term air pollution values for each participant, land-use regression models were applied to their residential address. Moreover, to elucidate relationships between health outcomes and diet, dietary intake data were collected for 1,469 participants of the KORA FF4 cohort. Dietary intake was derived using a method combining information from a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and repeated 24-h food lists [66]. In brief, the usual food intake (in gram/day) was calculated as the product of the probability of consumption of a food on a given day and the average amount of a food consumed on a consumption day.

DNA Extraction, 16S rRNA Gene Amplification, and Amplicon Sequencing. Fecal DNA extraction was isolated by following the protocol of [67]. The samples were profiled by high-throughput amplicon sequencing with dual-index barcoding using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Based on a study providing guidelines for selecting primer pairs [68], the V3-V4 region of the gene encoding 16S ribosomal RNA was amplified using the primers 341-forward (CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG; bacterial domain specific) and 785-reverse (GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC; bacterial domain specific). Amplification was undertaken using the Phusian High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase Hotstart as per manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR libraries were then barcoded using a dual-index system. Following a round of purification with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), libraries were quantified and pooled to 2nM. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq (2 x 250 bp), using facilities provided by the Ziel NGS-Core Facility of the Technical University Muenchen (TUM).

Bioinformatics. The demultiplexed, per-sample, primer-free amplicon reads were processed by the DADA2 workflow [22, 69] to infer sequence variants, remove chimeras, and assign taxonomies with the Silva v128 database [70] using the naive Bayesian classifier method [71] until the genus-level assignment and the exact matching method [72] for species-level assignment. We opted for the high-resolution DADA2 method to infer sequence variants without any fixed threshold, thereby resolving variants that differ by as little as one nucleotide. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) do not impose the arbitrary dissimilarity thresholds that define OTUs. They provide consistent labels because they represent a biological reality that exists outside the data being analyzed: the DNA sequence of the assayed organism, thus they remain consistent into the indefinite future [22]. The result of the DADA2 pipeline is two datasets: (i) a ASV count dataset, where each row specifies how often an ASV was sequenced and (ii) a taxonomic assignment dataset, where each row specifies the taxonomic names of an ASV. It is common to create a phylogenetic tree of the ASVs to later on calculate microbial diversity measures such as the DivNet [55] and UniFrac [73] (see the Statistical analysis stage of Methods Section 2). The multiple genome alignment for the phylogenetic tree was built with the DECIPHER R package enabling a profile-to-profile method aligns a sequence set by merging profiles along a guide tree until all the input sequences are aligned [74]. The multiple genome alignment was used to construct the de novo phylogenetic tree using phangorn R package. We first construct a neighbor-joining tree [75], and then fit a maximum likelihood tree using the neighbor-joining tree as a starting point. After 16S rRNA sequencing the 2,033 stool samples from the KORA cohort and processing the sequences with the DADA2 pipeline, we observe 15,801 ASVs (see Fig A and Table A in S1 Text).

The four stages of the causal framework [21] that we use to construct hypothetical randomized experiments to study the environment-microbiome relationship are the following:

To understand whether environmental interventions have an effect on the human gut microbiome, the objective is to reconstruct a hypothetical experiment that mimics a controlled randomized experiment [53], in which an environmental intervention could be believed to have been randomized. Let Wi be the indicator of the assignment for subject i (i = 1, …, N) to an environmental intervention vs. none, where:

Only one of the two potential outcomes can actually be observed for each subject: this is why the Rubin Causal Model characterizes causal inference as a missing data problem [52], where the observed outcome of subject-i and taxa-b can be expressed as a function of both potential outcomes:

The human gut microbiome can be composed of trillions of bacteria. However, due to technology limitations, the exact abundance and number of all strains present in a human subject cannot be measured. To tackle this limitation, we opted for the processing of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) from our sequencing data to approximate the true gut microbiome composition of our study population [22, 69]. ASVs refer to individual DNA sequences recovered from a high-throughput marker gene analysis, the 16S rRNA gene in our case. Therefore, in this study the observed outcome under investigation is a N × A matrix, for a = 1, …, A ASVs, an approximation of the N × B matrix described above. This limitation adds another layer of missing data, i.e., we are missing the true gut microbial composition of each subject. We define the ASV counts we measured for each subject-i as
Cia,obs
, which corresponds to
Yib∈A,obs
plus some measurement error.

To assess causality, randomized experiments have long been regarded as the “gold standard”. We are interested in the effect of environmental interventions that are often unpractical or ethical to assign randomly to humans within an experiment [21]. Therefore, we resort to a design stage [76] with a matched-sampling strategy to construct two hypothetical randomized experiments to assess the effects of an intervention on the changes in gut microbiome composition. The aim of our pair-matching strategy is to achieve balance in background covariates distributions as it is expected, on average, in randomized experiments. This approach attempts to create exchangeable groups as if the exposure was randomly assigned to each participant given measured covariates, to guarantee exposure assignment is not confounded by the measured background covariates. The exposure assignment mechanism determines which units receive which exposure; in other words, which potential outcomes are observed and which are missing [52]. The unconfoundedness of the assignment mechanism given covariates is a key assumption of the Rubin Causal Model.

It is well known that diet has an influence on the gut microbiome and future studies on the gut should include dietary intake data in their analysis [78, 79]. In our study, we only have access to dietary intake data for a portion of our samples, therefore we examine balance diagnostics in usual nutrient intake after matching in order to maintain a large data set before matching. Figs H-I in S1 Text show that after matching, our intervention and control units (in both hypothetical experiments) do not exhibit imbalance with respect to the following food items: potatoes/roots, vegetables, legumes, fruits/nuts, dairy products, cereal products, meat, fish, egg products, fat, and sugar. In the same way, we checked for covariate balance after matching for medication intake, also a well-known confounder in human gut microbiome studies. Figs D and G in S1 Text show that after matching, our intervention and control units (in both hypothetical experiments) do not exhibit imbalance with respect to medication intake.

To compare the gut microbiome of subjects under the environmental intervention to control subjects, we choose to not rely on asymptotic arguments, but instead take a Fisherian perspective (i.e., randomization-based inference) [45, 80]. We test sharp null hypotheses (H0) of no effect of the intervention for any unit by choosing test statistics that account for the complex microbiome data structure, including the additional “layer” of missing data. The ASV count data has a challenging structure because: (i) it is high-dimensional, (ii) some ASVs have low prevalence, (iii) the ASVs are strongly correlated, and (iv) it is compositional. ASV-count data is said to be “compositional” because between units comparison of ASV counts might not be informative due to the limited sequencing depth of the machine and the total number of sequenced reads varies from unit to unit (i.e., they have no common denominator) [81].

In randomization-based inference the goal is to construct the null randomization distribution of a test statistic assuming H0, T, by computing the values of the test statistic for all possible intervention assignments. Because the number of assignments is very large, we calculate an approximating p-value using Niter iterations, i.e., the proportion of computed test statistics that are as large or larger than the observed test statistic:
1Niter∑l=1Niter1Tl≥Tobs
, where
1Tl≥Tobs=1
when Tl ≥ Tobs, and 0 otherwise (for two-sided tests we obtain the p-values by taking absolute value of Tl and Tobs, i.e., |Tl| and |Tobs|). A small p-value shows that the observed test statistic is a rare event when the null hypothesis is true, which indicates the results are worth further scrutiny [82]. In the following subsections, we describe the null hypotheses we test and the test statistics we use to draw randomization-based inferences with Niter = 10,000 possible intervention assignments following a matched-pair design (see summary Table 3). This means that the permutations of the intervention assignment vectors needed to calculate the Fisher p-values follow the design of our hypothetical experiments. When units have varying probabilities of being treated, the analysis of experiments, even when hypothetical, should reflect their design [53, 76].

*Within Subjects Diversity.

Step 2–3. essentially represent a translation of the multiple test statistics into p-values sharing a common 0–1 scale.

Compositional equivalence.

Choice of test statistic. We compare the intervention and control networks with test statistics for the difference in genera associations individually. To generate sampling distributions of the test statistics under H0,N, the intervention and control labels are reassigned 10,000 times to the samples while the matched pair structure is maintained, i.e., the assignment to intervention or control is permuted within each pair. The SPIEC-EASI framework is then re-applied to each permuted data set. This procedure is implemented with the Network Construction and Comparison for Microbiome Data, NetCoMi, R package [59]. To adjust for multiple differential association tests, we use the method described in the β-diversity and differential abundance analyses section [91].

If the null hypothesis of no difference in the gut microbiome between the matched groups of treated and control units is rejected, that difference warrants further scrutiny to assess whether it can be attributed to the different treatments, assuming the assignment “unconfoundness” assumption holds. We can then report that the gut microbiome composition was or was not altered by the introduction of the environmental intervention. It is important to note that interpretation should be restricted to units that remain in the finite sample after matching (see their detailed characteristics in Figs B-I in S1 Text). The data do not provide direct information for “unmatched” units. Caution regarding extrapolation to units with covariate values beyond values observed in the balanced subset of the data is necessary.

To illustrate our causal inference framework, we first conceptualize two hypothetical environmental interventions that potentially influence the gut microbiome: (i) an air pollution reduction, and (ii) a smoking prevention intervention. Second, for each intervention, we construct a hypothetical matched-pair randomized experiment, aiming at satisfying the “unconfoundedness” assumption (see Methods section). Third, we analyze the “unconfounded”/“as-if randomized” data subset with randomization-based inference to test sharp null hypotheses of no effect of the interventions for each unit at different taxonomic levels of the microbial ASV data. The results presented subsequently correspond to the third stage of the framework. Fourth, causal conclusions are developed in the Discussion section. Following the American Statistical Association statement [82, 94], we avoid searching for “statistically significant” results with a dichotomous approach. To give structure to our results reporting, we reject the sharp null hypotheses of no effect of an environmental intervention when the p-value is lower or equal to 0.1 or, when computed, when the adjusted p-value is lower or equal to 0.2. We are more tolerant with adjusted p-values because multiple comparison adjustments are conservative and our study is exploring a nearly untapped field. Nonetheless, we highly recommend to the readers interested in our research questions or result replication to examine all reported p-values in Figs and Tables, because higher p-values do not mean that an effect is improbable, absent, false, or unimportant [82].

Our study is based on data from the KORA FF4 study cohort [17]. Because we performed a design stage before analyzing the data we have two study populations, one per hypothetical experiment, which are subsets of the entire cohort (see Design stage in the Methods section). In the air pollution reduction experiment, we analyze 99 matched pairs of subjects living in highly (PM2.5 ≥ 13.0 μg/m3) and less (PM2.5 ≤ 10.3 μg/m3) polluted areas with similar background characteristics distributions (Table 4 and Figs B-D and Fig H in S1 Text). The thresholds for the air pollution experiment intervention are based on 90th and 10th percentiles of the PM2.5 distribution. We focus on the PM2.5 pollutant, originating mainly from traffic emissions and fossil fuel combustion, for its known penetrating effects into the lung and potential implication for the gut microbiome [27]. In the smoking prevention experiment, we analyze 271 matched pairs of smokers and never-smokers (with background characteristics distributions presented in Table 4 and Figs E-G and Fig I in S1 Text). A total of 45 units are included in the balanced data subset of both hypothetical experiments.

A common first step in microbiome data analysis is estimating and assessing microbial diversity. We begin by investigating the potentially causal effects of the interventions on within-subject diversity (α−diversity) and between-subject variation (β−diversity), respectively.

Gut bacterial richness and Shannon diversity were estimated on the ASV level with the breakaway [83] and DivNet [55] method, respectively. Comparisons of the distributions of these estimated variables between subject under the intervention vs. not in both hypothetical experiments are shown by boxplots in Fig 2. The small approximate Fisherian p-values based on 10,000 permutations of the intervention assignment give us ground for rejecting the null hypotheses of no effect of an air pollution reduction (p-valueap,richness ≈ 0.0008, p-valueap,α−div. ≈ 0.0388) and smoking prevention (p-values,richness ≈ 0.1518, p-values,α−div. ≈ 0.0497) on the diversity of the human gut microbiome. On average, lower diversity was observed in the subjects living in polluted areas or smokers compared to participants living in less polluted areas or non-smokers. This diversity difference motivates the more in-depth analyses of the gut microbiome composition presented subsequently.

To estimate β-diversity indices, we calculated UniFrac, Aitchison, Jaccard, and Gower dissimilarities between all possible pairs of subjects. The results are shown in Table 5. To alleviate the problem of choosing the best dissimilarity metric for β−diversity estimation, we follow the Microbiome Regression-based Kernel Association Test (MiRKAT) of Zhao et al. [84] suggesting to compute several metrics and then adjust for multiple comparisons. In both experiments, we reject the sharp null hypotheses of no effect of the intervention on between-subject variation.

We next investigated whether shifts in microbial compositions as a whole or differences in specific microbial taxa were observable in the hypothetical experiments. We illustrate this by designing and analyzing sharp null hypotheses for global compositional means and differential genus abundances.

Testing whether two study groups have the same microbiome composition can be viewed as a two-sample testing problem for high-dimensional compositional mean equivalence. We tested sharp null hypotheses using a test statistic developed particularly for that purpose by Cao et al. [56]. Table 6 summarizes the results for each taxonomic level. We reject the sharp null hypotheses of gut microbiome composition equivalence for the air pollution reduction and smoking prevention experiments. In both experiments, p-values are higher at the ASV level than at higher taxonomy levels.

For compositional microbiome data, identifying sets of potentially “differentially abundant taxa” relates to testing sharp null hypotheses of no difference in abundance of individual taxa with respect to a reference set. We conducted such an analysis on the genus level for all genera present in at least 5% of the samples. This prevalence threshold was guided by the amount of information preserved when performing filtering, i.e., microbial abundance and the number of taxa observed per sample (see Figs N-Q in S1 Text). We applied the Differential abundance testing for compositional data (DACOMP) approach [57] and used two-sided tests since we lack prior knowledge on the direction of the abundance changes. Fig 3 highlights the key DACOMP results for both experiments. In the air pollution reduction experiment, we reject the sharp null hypothesis of no differential abundance only for the Marvinbryantia genus (p-valueadj. = 0.0120) (see Table B in S1 Text). We also reject the sharp null hypothesis of no effect of smoking prevention for eleven genera (see Fig 3 and Table C in S1 Text). Five belong to the Ruminococcaceae family: Ruminococcaceae-UCG-002, Ruminococcaceae-UCG-003, Ruminococcaceae-UCG-005, Ruminococcus-1, and Ruminococcaceae-NK4A214-group, three to the Lachnospiraceae family: Lachnospira, Lachnospiraceae-NK4A136-group, and Coprococcus-1, one to the Christensenellaceae family: Christensenellaceae-R-7-group, and two to the Mollicutes class, which belong to the NB1-n and Mollicutes-RF9 order.

To gain insights into changes in the organizational structure of the underlying microbial gut ecosystem, we next calculated sparse genus-genus association networks for each exposure level and hypothetical experiment and highlight the results of our randomization-based differential association testing.

We used the Sparse InversE Covariance estimation for Ecological ASsociation Inference (SPIEC-EASI) framework [58] to infer genus-genus associations in our two hypothetical experiments. We used the glasso mode of SPIEC-EASI with default parameters (see Methods for details). Fig 4A shows the overall structure of the learned sparse association networks for the smoking prevention experiment (smokers (left panel) and non-smokers (right panel), respectively). Each network possesses a single large connected component consisting of 30–40 mostly Firmicutes genera (highlighted area in Fig 4A). These connected components also included the majority of the previously identified potentially differentially abundant genera, including Ruminococcaceae (UCG-005, UCG-002), Ruminococcus-1, and Christensenellaceae-R-7-group (see Fig 4B for a detailed view of the connectivity pattern). The genus-genus associations networks derived from the air pollution reduction experiment showed similar overall topological features containing one large connected component of 60 genera, including Ruminococcaceae (UCG-005, UCG-003, UCG-002) and Christensenellaceae-R-7-group among others (see also Fig R in S1 Text).

To identify potentially differential network associations in the intervention experiments, we coupled the SPIEC-EASI network estimation procedure with permutations of the intervention assignment, available in the NetCoMi R package [59] (see also Methods for details). For each hypothetical experiment, we list the five genus-genus associations with smallest adjusted two-sided randomization-based p-values in Table 7 and highlight these associations in Fig 4B. In the air pollution reduction experiment, we reject the sharp null hypothesis of no differential association for two edges: the Succinivibrio/Slackia edge (p-valueadj. ≈ 0.0661), and the Ruminiclostridium/Cloacibacillus edge (p-valueadj. ≈ 0.1063) (see Table 7 and Fig R in S1 Text).

In the smoking prevention experiment, we also reject the sharp null hypothesis of no differential association for two edges: the Ruminiclostridium-6/Ruminococcaceae-UCG-010 edge (p-valueadj. ≈ 0.1585), and the Ruminiclostridium-6/Christensenellaceae-R-7-group edge (p-valueadj. ≈ 0.1585) (see Table 7). The genera that participate in these potentially differential associations are also highlighted in Fig 4B.

The gut microbiome is a substantial driver of circulating lipid levels, and prior work has shown [65, 95, 96] that the relative abundance of several microbial families, including Christensenellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and the Tenericutes phylum were negatively correlated with triglyceride and positively associated with high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol. Since our analysis identified a small interconnected group of genera, including Christensenellaceae and Ruminococcaceae, for whom we rejected the no differential abundance hypothesis, we performed an exploratory data analysis to investigate taxa-serum lipid measurements associations. Four lipids were measured in blood serum samples of our study population from the KORA cohort: total, HDL, and LDL, cholesterol, as well as triglyceride levels. Fig 5A shows the correlation between these lipids and the genera we discovered in our hypothetical experiments. Tendencies similar to those reported in previous studies can be observed in our data.

For instance, in the smoking prevention dataset, we observed a positive correlation of Christensenellaceae R-7-group and Ruminococcaceae (UCG-005) genus abundances (under centered log-ratio transformation) with HDL cholesterol and negative correlation with triglyceride levels, respectively (see Fig 5B). Similar correlation patterns were also found for the other genera for whom we rejected the no differential abundance hypothesis (see second and forth column in Fig 5A). Our findings were also in line with recently reported correlation results in Vojinovic et al. [65] using the Dutch LifeLines-DEEP cohort [13] and the Rotterdam Study [14].

To assess whether the pair-matching strategy chosen for the design stage influenced the conclusions of this study, we conducted a sensitivity analysis (see Sensitivity Analysis section in S1 Text). For that, we implemented the more commonly-used propensity score matching algorithm [97] and obtained matched samples of: 1) 158 participants living in low PM2.5 areas and 158 participants living in higher PM2.5 areas, and 2) 290 smokers and 290 never smokers (see Table D and Figs T-Y in S1 Text for the balance diagnostics). For both hypothetical randomized experiments, using propensity score matching at the design stage results in analyzing more matched samples. The microbial diversity analyses lead to the same conclusion for both experiments despite different design stages (see Fig Z and Tables E-F in S1 Text). Overall, we also observe small approximate Fisherian p-values after performing the propensity score matching, in the same way we observe small approximate Fisherian p-values with our pair-matching strategy. The test statistics have the same direction and magnitude. For the air pollution reduction experiment, the adjusted p-values are higher when performing propensity score matching when checking for differential abundances, i.e., we cannot reject the sharp null hypothesis of no differential abundance for the Marvinbryantia genus. For the smoking prevention experiment, we can reject the sharp null of no differential abundance for the same taxa and additional ones when performing propensity score matching compared to pair-matching (see Table C and Table G in S1 Text).

We first discuss the results presented above, then elaborate on the statistical framework we used for our analyses, and suggest statistical and epidemiological extensions of our work.

In the smoking prevention experiment, the subset of genera retained at the differential abundance analysis step was linked to the serum markers triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein in previous studies [65, 95, 96]. In our data, we observe correlations between these genera and metabolites in the same direction than previously found by Vojinovic [65] (see Fig 5). Serum triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein play a role in metabolic syndrome, and associations between smoking and metabolic syndrome have also been found previously [107]. Therefore, we suggest further investigation on the pathway of cigarette smoke impacting the gut, which in turn has effects on circulating metabolites (and metabolic syndrome). A logical next step would be to apply our framework to other cohorts with similar amplicon data preprocessing and available pre-exposure covariates such as the Dutch LifeLines-DEEP [13] and Rotterdam Studies [14], and observe whether our results replicate.

The remaining reviewer concerns in the second review round did not concern technical aspects but rather the reviewers' impression that we authors overstated certain points. The authors have chosen one of several possible approaches in the field of causal inference and demonstrated how it can be used for metagenomic data. They could have chosen another. The reviewers were concerned that the authors wanted to claim that their choice is not just a possible choice but a superior one, but the authors made it clear in their response that it was not their intention to make any statement in this regard. i feel the the text in its current form no longer gives that impression, and the reviewers remaining concerns are addressed. Hence, I do not think that another review round is required and consider the paper as ready for publication. I hope the reviewers agree.
