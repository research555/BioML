Microbial Adaptation Due to Gastric Bypass Surgery: The Nutritional Impact

Bariatric surgery leads to sustained weight loss and the resolution of obesity-related comorbidities. Recent studies have suggested that changes in gut microbiota are associated with the weight loss induced by bariatric surgery. Several studies have observed major changes in the microbial composition following gastric bypass surgery. However, there are inconsistencies between the reported alterations in microbial compositions in different studies. Furthermore, it is well established that diet is an important factor shaping the composition and function of intestinal microbiota. However, most studies on gastric bypass have not assessed the impact of dietary intake on the microbiome composition in general, let alone the impact of restrictive diets prior to bariatric surgery, which are recommended for reducing liver fat content and size. Thus, the relative impact of bariatric surgery on weight loss and gut microbiota remains unclear. Therefore, this review aims to provide a deeper understanding of the current knowledge of the changes in intestinal microbiota induced by bariatric surgery considering pre-surgical nutritional changes.

The increasing prevalence of obesity, caused by the changing dietary and exercise habits, seems to have reached epidemic proportions worldwide with more than 650 million adults being affected in 2016 [1]. Western diets, defined by a high fat and low fibre intake, sedentary lifestyle and genetics, are common causes of obesity [2]. Recent findings have suggested that gut microbiota play a role in the onset of obesity by contributing to energy homeostasis and fat storage [3,4,5] (Figure 1). Furthermore, there is evidence that gut microbiota varies in lean and obese individuals [4,6,7]. In particular, there is a difference in the intestinal ratio of Bacteroides and Firmicutes between lean and obese individuals with a greater relative abundance of Firmicutes in obese individuals. At present, only bariatric surgery seems to induce sustained weight loss and resolution of obesity-related morbidities, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hypertension and cardiovascular disease [8,9,10,11,12,13], relatively attributable to microbial alterations.

Diet is an important factor shaping the composition and function of intestinal microbiota. However, most studies on gastric bypass have not assessed the impact of dietary intake in general. Additionally, the effects of restrictive diets prior to bariatric surgery, which are recommended for reducing liver fat content and size, on the microbiome composition were not investigated in detail. Thus, the relative impact of bariatric surgery on weight loss and gut microbiota remains unclear. Therefore, this review aims to provide a deeper understanding of the changes in intestinal microbiota induced by bariatric surgery considering pre-surgical nutritional changes.

A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed using the search terms “gastrointestinal microbiome”, “gastrointestinal microbiota”, “microbiome”, “microbiota”, “gut microbiome”, “bariatric surgery”, “gastric bypass”, “Roux-en-Y gastric bypass”, RYGB”, “mini gastric bypass” and “MGB” individually or in combination. We selected publications between February 2009 and January 2020 containing original research on humans. Of the selected articles, the full texts, as well as the references, were reviewed. If the reference list contained eligible articles, those were also included. All publications not composed in the English language were excluded.

Obesity is associated with changes in the relative abundance of the two dominant bacterial divisions: Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes [4]. Ley et al. discovered in a study comparing lean and obese mice that the ob/ob animals showed a 50% reduction in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, whereas the level of Firmicutes was higher by a corresponding degree [6]. Analogous differences can be observed in the distal gut microbiota of obese versus lean humans [4]. Animal models have produced evidence for the causal role of intestinal microbiota in the aetiology of obesity and insulin resistance [14]. Turnbaugh et al. showed that faecal microbial transplantation (FMT) of faeces from obese mice into lean, germ-free mice (GF) led to a marked increase in body weight of the recipient animals [4]. The obese phenotype seems to be transmissible and is promoted by microbiota with an increased capacity to harvest energy from the host’s diet [4,15]. In line with these findings, a study where faecal microbiota from a pair of twins, discordant in their obesity status, was transplanted into GF mice showed that recipients from the obese donor gained significantly more weight than their counterparts with the lean donor [16]. Such causal relation is scarce for humans; however, one case report depicts a woman successfully treated with FMT who developed new-onset obesity after receiving stool from a healthy but overweight donor [17]. Regarding the improvement of obesity-associated metabolic parameters, Zhang et al. found mixed results, as two of the reviewed studies reported an improved peripheral insulin sensitivity after FMT, while some other studies showed no differences in fasting plasma glucose, hepatic insulin sensitivity or BMI after following FMT [18].

Using these recent studies, it is not possible to confirm whether associations between obesity and the two dominant bacterial phyla exist because there are discrepancies in the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio and, therefore, its relation to obesity [24,28]. It is likely that the influence of the gut microbiome on obesity is much more complex than simply an imbalance in the proportion of bacteria phyla [24]. Phylum-wide changes in the gut microbiota cannot be currently considered as biomarkers for obesity [25]. Due to a variety of confounding factors within the human population (heterogeneity in genotype, lifestyle, diet, ethnicity), a suitable definition of an “obese” microbiota is currently impossible [25,29]. In addition, the causal relationship and underlying mechanism remain outstanding [25].

Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective treatment option for achieving sustained weight loss and the resolution of obesity-related comorbidities, such as T2DM, NAFLD, cardiovascular disease and reduced mortality [9,10,11,12,13]. Bariatric surgery is recommended for individuals with a BMI of ≥ 40 kg/m² or a BMI of > 35 kg/m² with obesity-related comorbidities [30]. There are several bariatric surgery procedures, of which Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most frequently undertaken procedure globally [31,32], due to the profound weight loss [33] and cardiometabolic improvement observed after this surgery [34,35]. RYGB surgery consists of a reduction of gastric volume by forming a small gastric pouch and a section of jejunum is then connected to the pouch. Thereby, the majority of the stomach, duodenum and the proximal jejunum are excluded from the intestinal tract [36].

Given the known association between food intake and gut microbial richness and the dramatic changes in food intake after gastric bypass surgery, Al Assal et al. recently investigated the microbial profile from obese diabetic women before and after RYGB surgery while taking into account the nutritional impact. Therefore, the authors evaluated the microbiome from 25 patients before, three months after and 12 months after surgery. Food intake was calculated using a seven-day food record. RYGB surgery resulted in changes in the relative abundance of some gut bacteria genera (Table 1), increased gut microbial richness and induced a decrease in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio 12 months post-RYGB surgery. Microbial richness level was correlated with diet composition both in the pre- and post-surgery state. However, increased microbial richness was not associated with total diabetes remission. The genus richness had a positive correlation with the fibre/lipid intake ratio and the fibre intake alone and it also had a negative correlation with the lipid intake both pre and postoperatively. Specifically, a direct correlation was exhibited between the lipid intake and levels of one unclassified genus of Acidaminococcaceae and an inverse correlation was exhibited between the lipid intake and Parabacteroides levels. Protein intake had an inverse correlation with Akkermansia levels and a direct correlation with levels of one unclassified Veillonellaceae. Interestingly, only patients achieving diabetes remission increased their total soluble and insoluble fibre intake and decreased saturated fat intake [80]. Thus, additionally to bariatric surgery-induced microbial adaptation, the diet itself, on a macronutrient level, affects the microbial composition and consequently weight loss.

As previously stated, diet plays a key role in shaping the microbiome. Alterations in dietary habits can induce microbial shifts within 24 h, which are determined by the competition for substrates and the toleration of gut conditions [15,86]. The strongest dietary influence on the formation of the microbial metabolites is exerted by non-digestible carbohydrates, protein and fat [86]. In studies with digestible carbohydrates, where humans were fed high levels of glucose, fructose and sucrose, an increased relative abundance of Bifidobacteria and a reduced count of Bacteroides was observed. Non-digestible carbohydrates, however, seem to have a positive effect on microbiota gene richness. A diet rich in non-digestible carbohydrates increases the abundance of intestinal Bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria [15]. Bifidobacteria are beneficial bacteria in the gut whose growth can be stimulated with prebiotic fibre ingestion [87]. Prebiotics, which are defined as non-digestible dietary components that benefit their host’s health via the selective stimulation of growth and/ or activity of certain microorganisms, induce shifts in the gut microbiome [15]. Major products of the fermentation of carbohydrates, such as the short-chain fatty acids propionate and butyrate, serve as an energy source for the host and provide anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects [86]. The Prevotella enterotype, which is one of the leading causes of inter-individual gut microbiota variations, is associated with high values of carbohydrates and simple sugars in the diet. It is hypothesised to be sensitive to long-term fibre intake [88,89]. Vegetarians and members of agrarian societies show enrichment in Prevotella [88,90].

In addition to its influence on microbial composition, preoperative weight loss with a VLCD can help simplify gastric surgeries [29]. In particular, an enlarged liver compromises the visibility of the gastroesophageal area making it more friable and, therefore, more prone to bleeding [26]. In a study by Lewis et al., after six weeks of an Optifast® diet, the mean liver volume was reduced by 14.7% and the mean liver fat by 43%. This suggests that the reduction in liver volume is due to a loss of fat [96]. Similar results can be found in a clinical trial by Gils Contreras et al. where the liver volume was reduced by 15.6% after three weeks of VLCD. The reduction was directly related to the baseline BMI [26]. Generally, the highest decrease in liver volume seems to be achieved in the first two weeks of the diet [28,29]. Although a reduced liver size might positively influence the surgeon’s perceived difficulty of the procedure, there were no differences found regarding mean operating time, estimated blood loss or intraoperative complications compared to control groups without preoperative VLCD [28,97]. Only the risk of postoperative complications, especially infections, decreased after the preoperative diet in comparison to no prior diet [28]. However, most studies do not assess the diet-induced microbial alterations prior to surgery resulting in a biased comparison of the atypical microbial compositions at baseline and after surgery.

Even though bariatric surgery is established as the only effective treatment option for achieving sustained weight loss and metabolic improvement, the exact mode of action is still unresolved. The total extent of weight loss exhibits high inter-individual variation in patients (responder vs non-responders). Our research shows that it is likely that differential changes in gut microbiota account for the variability found after gastric bypass surgeries. In addition to the surgically induced microbial adaptation, the diet itself, on a macronutrient level, affects the microbial composition and, therefore, weight loss. It is well documented that diet is an important factor shaping the composition and function of intestinal microbiota. However, most studies on bariatric surgery do not assess food intake pre- or post-surgery or adjust for changes in food intake and digestion afterwards. Thus, further research efforts are needed to deepen the understanding of gut microbial changes after bariatric surgery, which induce weight loss and metabolic improvements, and the relative impact of nutrition.
