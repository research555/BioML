The Gut Microbiome among Postmenopausal Latvian Women in Relation to Dietary Habits

In recent years, many studies have been initiated to characterise the human gut microbiome in relation to different factors like age, lifestyle, and dietary habits. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of yoghurt intake on the gut microbiome among postmenopausal women and how overall dietary habits modulate the gut microbiome. In total, 52 participants were included in the study and two groups—a control (n = 26) and experimental group (n = 26)—were established. The study was eight weeks long. Both study groups were allowed to consume a self-selected diet, but the experimental group had to additionally consume 175 g of plain organic milk yoghurt on a daily basis for eight weeks. In addition, a series of questionnaires were completed, including a questionnaire on the subject’s sociodemographic background, health status, and lifestyle factors, as well as a food frequency questionnaire. Stool samples were collected for the analysis of the gut microbiome (both prior to and after the eight weeks of the study). Sequencing of V4-V5 regions of the 16S rRNA gene was used to determine the bacterial composition of stool samples. The dominant phylum from the gut microbiome was Firmicutes (~70% to 73%), followed by Bacteroidota (~20% to 23%). Although no significant changes in the gut microbiome were related to daily consumption of yoghurt, we report that consumption of food products like grains, grain-based products, milk and milk products, and beverages (tea, coffee) is associated with differences in the composition of the gut microbiome. Establishing nutritional strategies to shape the gut microbiome could contribute to improved health status in postmenopausal women, but further research is needed.

The microbiota is all commensal microorganisms colonising the body (bacteria, archaea, viruses, and unicellular eukaryotes). The largest microbial population is found in the human gut with the total number of bacterial cells ranging from 1013 to 1014. The ensemble of genes contained by this microbiota is known as the “gut microbiome” [1,2,3,4]. Four major microbial phyla represent over 90% of gut microbiota—Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteriota [5,6]. The phylum Firmicutes is composed of genus such as Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterococcus, and Ruminococcus. The phylum Bacteroidota consists of the genus such as Bacteroides and Prevotella. The phylum Actinobacteriota (main genus Bifidobacterium) and phylum Proteobacteria are less abundant [7].

In Latvia, several studies [20,21] evaluating the gut microbiome among adults with different dietary habits have been started, but results are not yet summarised and publicly available. This study is unique as it aimed to not only evaluate how overall dietary habits modulate the gut microbiome in a specific target population but also how a specific product (yoghurt) included in the everyday diet can impact the gut microbiome.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of yoghurt intake on the gut microbiome among postmenopausal women in Latvia. Prior to the study, approval from the Riga Stradiņš University Ethics Committee was obtained (protocol code No. 22-2/278/2021. and date of approval—15 April 2021). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before the study.

Sequence reads were processed within the QIIME2 software environment [26]. Primer trimming with Cutadapt [27] was followed by denoising with the DADA2 algorithm [28], which produced error-corrected amplicon sequence variant (ASV) features. ASVs were taxonomically classified by VSEARCH [29] against the SILVA v138 NR99 SSU rRNA database [30]. Before further calculations, feature tables were filtered to remove singletons, unclassified and eukaryotic ASVs, and feature counts were normalised between samples using the SRS algorithm [31]. Alpha (within-sample) diversity was calculated as Shannon’s index [32]. Beta (between-sample) diversity was calculated as Bray–Curtis dissimilarity [33]. IBM SPSS Statistics 23 was used for food frequency questionnaires and other data statistical analysis. Non-parametrical statistical tests such as the independent samples Mann–Whitney U Test and independent samples median test were applied to analyse the data. To evaluate how overall dietary habits modulate the gut microbiome, non-parametric partial Spearman’s rank correlations were calculated while controlling for the following covariates (age, education level, body mass index, waist-to-hip-ratio, last menstrual period, smoking, use of alcohol, bone mineral density level, and use of antibiotics). A principal component analysis was conducted to identify different patterns related to dietary habits and gut microbiome composition among the participants. The count of patterns of principal component analysis was identified based on the eigenvalue (≥1). Values with the factor loading ≥|0.5| were considered to contribute significantly to the identified components. A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant for all statistical tests.

The characteristics of the participants are compiled in Table 2. According to the body mass index, 17 of the participants had a normal body mass index (18.5 to 24.9 kg m−2), 18 participants were overweight (25.0 to 29.9 kg m−2), and 17 participants were obese (≥30 kg·m−2).

Data from the food frequency questionnaire are compiled in Supplementary Table S2 and Figure S1. No significant differences were found regarding food, beverage, and dietary supplement intake among study groups, except for vitamin D dietary supplement intake, which was higher among the participants from the experimental group (average intake frequency “three to four times a week” reported in the experimental group and average intake frequency “two to three times a month” reported in the control group, p = 0.026) and coffee intake which was also higher among the experimental group (Supplementary Table S2, p = 0.039).

Older participants were consuming less vegetables (ρ = -0.289, p = 0.044), but participants with a higher waist circumference were consuming more meat products (ρ = 0.305, p = 0.033) and fish products (ρ = 0.362, p = 0.011).

The dominant phylum from the gut microbiome was Firmicutes (~70% to 73%), followed by phylum Bacteroidota (~20% to 23%). The rest of the gut microbiome consisted of phylum Actinobacteriota and other phyla (Figure 1).

Using principal component analysis, three dietary habits and gut microbiome composition-related profiles were identified, explaining 26.01% of the total profile variance (Supplementary Table S4):

National nutritional guidelines for adults [34] recommend consuming on a daily basis at least 500 g of vegetables, fruits and berries, of which at least 300 g should be vegetables and 200 g of fruits and berries. Unfortunately, the average vegetable intake among study participants was significantly lower. For only three participants (all from the experimental group), the daily vegetable intake reached the recommended 300 g per day. Overall, the calculated average daily intake of vegetables reached only ~125 to 180 g per day. Also, the average fruit and berries intake was slightly lower, reaching only around 160 to 170 g per day. Vegetables, fruits, and berries are important sources of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Therefore, it is important to include them in an everyday diet regardless of age [35].

Therefore, the consumption of fermented milk products, including yoghurt, should be recommended on a daily basis. A healthy gut microbiome is important for optimal metabolic and immune functions and the prevention of diseases among postmenopausal women [18].

This is the first study reporting the gut microbiome composition among postmenopausal women in Latvia. Although no significant changes in the composition of the gut microbiome were related to daily consumption of plain organic milk yoghurt, we report that consumption of food products like grains, grain-based products, milk and milk products, etc. and beverages (tea, coffee) are associated with differences in the composition of the gut microbiome. Nevertheless, very little is known about most of the representatives of gut microbiome, making it difficult to analyse the obtained data. Establishing nutritional strategies aiming to shape the gut microbiome could contribute to improved health status in postmenopausal women, therefore, further research should be continued. Possible modifications of plain organic milk yoghurt microflora by adding other probiotics belonging to Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. in addition to Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, could potentially lead to beneficial changes in the composition of the gut microbiome among postmenopausal women but further research is needed.

Future studies should also make use of analytical tools that provide higher resolution for microbiome investigation (such as shotgun metagenomics) and capture the various processes taking place in the host organism and its microbiomes (like metabolomics and transcriptomics). Extended longitudinal studies with multiple sampling points would also allow a better evaluation of the long-term effects of nutritional interventions.
