A prospective investigation into the association between the gut microbiome composition and cognitive performance among healthy young adults

There is emerging evidence that the gut microbiome composition is associated with several human health outcomes, which include cognitive performance. However, only a few prospective epidemiological studies exist and none among young adults. Here we address the gap in the literature by investigating whether the gut microbiome composition is prospectively linked to fluid intelligence among healthy young adults.

Forty individuals (65% females, 26 years) from the DOrtmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed (DONALD) study provided a fecal sample for gut microbiome composition and subsequently (average of 166 days) completed a cognitive functioning test using the Cattell’s Culture Fair Intelligence Test, revised German version (CFT 20-R). The assessment of the gut microbiome at the genera level was by 16S rRNA V3-V4 Illumina sequencing. The relative abundance of 158 genera was summarized into bacterial communities using a novel data-driven dimension reduction, amalgamation. The fluid intelligence score was regressed on the relative abundance of the bacterial communities and adjusted for selected covariates.

The 158 genera were amalgamated into 12 amalgams (bacterial communities), which were composed of 18, 6, 10, 14, 8, 10, 16, 13, 12, 12, 3, and 11 genera. Only the 14-genera bacterial community, named the “Ruminococcaceae- and Coriobacteriaceae-dominant community” was positively associated with fluid intelligence score (β = 7.8; 95% CI: 0.62, 15.65, P = 0.04).

Among healthy young adults, the abundance of a gut bacterial community was associated with fluid intelligence score. This study suggests that cognitive performance may potentially benefit from gut microbiome-based intervention.

It has become increasingly recognized that the gut microbiome may play a substantial role in the occurrence of many human conditions [1, 2]. More recently, the association of the gut microbiome with cognitive neurodevelopment and brain functioning has attracted much attention [3–7]. This association is attributed to the microbiota-gut-brain-axis [8, 9]. Indeed, epidemiological investigations have demonstrated associations between the composition of the gut microbiome and prevalent neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease [10–13] and Parkinson's disease [12, 14].

To this end, the present prospective epidemiological study sought to investigate whether the gut microbiome composition is independently associated with fluid intelligence among young adults.

Table
1 presents the basic characteristics of the 40 individuals in the current analysis. The median age at the time of fecal sampling was 26 years. About two-third (65%) were females. The median time between fecal sampling and the assessment of cognitive performance was 166 days. Furthermore, the birth weight was approximately 3.5 kg. Their BMI of 23.4 kg/m2 is within the normal weight range. They had a moderate physical activity of approximately 33 MET-hour/week. The median carbohydrate intake and alcohol consumption were 199 g/day and 0.39 g/day, respectively. The median Shannon alpha diversity of the gut microbiome was 6.1. Finally, the median fluid intelligence score was 110.

Regressing fluid intelligence score on “Ruminococcaceae- and Coriobacteriaceae-dominant community” and sex using the ordinary least squares regression showed that “Ruminococcaceae- and Coriobacteriaceae-dominant community” was positively associated with fluid intelligence score (β = 7.8; 95% CI: 0.62, 15.65, P = 0.04) and females had lower intelligence score when compared to males (β = − 9; 95% CI: − 17.36, − 0.71, P = 0.03). The model F statistic was significant (F = 4.05, P = 0.03), indicating that the model accounts for a significant portion of the variation in the data. The adjusted R-squared indicates that these two predictors explained approximately 14% of the variation in fluid intelligence score.

The current prospective epidemiological study among young adults investigated whether the gut microbiome composition was independently associated with fluid intelligence. Among the 12 bacterial communities retrieved from this study population, the “Ruminococcaceae- and Coriobacteriaceae-dominant community” was positive and independently associated with fluid intelligence. This 14-genera community comprises Ruminiclostridium 5, Ruminococcaceae UCG-010, Coriobacteriaceae uncultured bacterium, Slackia, [Eubacterium] hallii group, Peptoclostridium, Akkermansia, Lactococcus, Erysipelotrichaceae incertae sedis, [Eubacterium] nodatum group, Prevotellaceae uncultured bacterium, Robiginitalea, Pseudomonas, and, Bacteroidales S24-7 group uncultured bacterium.

A major strength of the current work is that it is a prospective observational study, in which the assessment of the exposure, gut microbiome composition precedes the outcome, fluid intelligence. Thus, our study design offers a reliable evidence of the association between the gut microbiome composition and fluid intelligence. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first epidemiological study to report on the association between the gut microbiome composition and fluid intelligence among young adults. Other strengths are that we performed a priori power analysis and our statistical model building was theory driven. We also conducted complementary regression analyses to ensure the robustness of our results. Furthermore, our study population is young adults; therefore, the impact of reverse causality is likely low. Thus, it is unlikely that we could have overestimated the true association between gut microbiome composition and fluid intelligence score. Nevertheless, better-designed larger prospective studies among young adults are needed to confirm our findings.

This study provides an interesting finding that the abundance of 14 interacting genera in the gut microbiome is positively linked to fluid intelligence score. This lends credence to the growing evidence that the gut microbiome may influence cognitive performance. Taken together, our study suggests that cognitive performance may potentially benefit from gut microbiome-based intervention and this group of bacteria may have a promising health-promoting role.

The DOrtmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed (DONALD) study is an ongoing, open prospective epidemiologic cohort study of individuals living in the German town of Dortmund and surrounding cities that commenced in 1985. The study was designed to investigate the relationships among dietary intake, metabolism, and growth from infancy into adulthood. Participants’ examinations included annually repeated anthropometric measurements and three-day weighed dietary records. Early-life factors such as birth weight of study participants were extracted from maternal delivery documents. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Bonn. Informed consent was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of the participants in childhood and later on from the participants themselves. Details of the recruitment and follow-up in the DONALD study are presented elsewhere [61].

This is a prospective study of adult (age ≥ 18 years) DONALD study participants who provided fecal samples for gut microbiome compositional analysis [59] and who subsequently attended cognitive testing few months after fecal sampling. These individuals were singletons, full term (36–42 weeks) and birth weight of ≥ 2500 g. There were 40 individuals in total. For these 40 individuals, we retrieved their gut microbiome RA data, cognition data, and other covariates.

Details of the fecal sampling, DNA extraction, 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing have been published [59]. Briefly, fecal samples were collected between 2017 and 2018 at the participants’ home into tubes containing RNAlater (Qiagen) and sent to the Biobank within 24 h of collection. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from 0.25 g of fecal sample using the repeat bead beating plus column protocol as in combination with the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit. For the 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified through 30 cycles of PCR reactions according to the 16S Metagenomic Sequencing preparation protocol for Illumina MiSeq. The Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME version 1.8.0) was used for quality filtering of pair-end reads, which is based on a quality score of > 25 and the removal of mismatching barcodes. Prior to the analysis as part of the quality control process, sequences which produced less than 40,000 reads were manually removed. USEARCH (version 7, 64-bit) was employed for deionization, chimera detection and clustering into operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 97% identity). Alignment of OTUs was carried out using the python nearest alignment space termination (PyNAST) and assignment of taxonomy of 97% similar identity against the SILVA SSURef database release v123. The R package Phyloseq was used to determine 341 genera and their relative abundances. The 158 abundant genera with RA ≥ 0.2% in at least 10% of the samples [59] were considered for this present study.

The cognitive performance was assessed between 2017 and 2018 using the Cattell’s Culture Fair Intelligence Test, revised German version (CFT 20-R) [62]. This computer-based CFT 20-R was done in the participants’ homes. The test comprises two parts, covering four domains: series, classifications, matrices, and topologies. The first and second parts comprised 56 and 45 figure-based questions and are to be complete within 14 min (4-4-3-3 min) and 12 min (3-3-3-3 min), respectively. The sum score of the domains was calculated from the correct answers, separately for each part. Age-standardized intelligence quotient (IQ) scores were derived from these sum scores to form IQ1 for the first part, IQ2 for the second part, and overall IQ–average of IQ1 and IQ2. If there was a difference ≥ 12 points between IQ1 and IQ2, the higher IQ was chosen as fluid intelligence score, otherwise the overall IQ was chosen as the fluid intelligence score.

Demographic information such as sex and birth weight were retrieved from maternal delivery records. Age at fecal sampling was calculated from the documented date of birth and the date of fecal sampling. Dietary intake was assessed annually using three-day weighed dietary records on three consecutive days. From all dietary records prior to fecal sampling (age ≤ 18 years), means of daily energy (kcal/day) and carbohydrate, fiber, protein, and fat (g/day) intakes were calculated. Anthropometric measurements were conducted annually at the study center. For the current study, we considered the weight and height measurement closest to fecal sampling to calculate the body mass index (BMI). Physical activity was self-reported in a validated questionnaire covering the frequency and duration of individuals’ participation in the home and leisure physical activities during the week and at weekends. This was converted to metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hours/week and the average over the available records of age ≤ 18 years was calculated for each individual. Educational status and lifestyle factors of the participants such as alcohol consumption and smoking, and self-reported intake of antibiotics and probiotics six months prior to fecal sampling, were obtained by questionnaires.

Continuous and categorical variables were summarized as median (25% and 75% percentile), and as count (percentage), respectively.

All statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software R version 4.1.1. The replacement of zeros, amalgamation, the adaptive LASSO, and the RF-RFE were implemented using the cmultRepl function from the zCompositions package, the amalgam package, the glmnet package, and the caret package, respectively.
