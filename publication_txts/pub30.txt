The Potential Mediation of the Effects of Physical Activity on Cognitive Function by the Gut Microbiome

The population of older adults is growing dramatically worldwide. As older adults are at greater risk of developing disorders associated with cognitive dysfunction (i.e., dementia), healthcare costs are expected to double by 2040. Evidence suggests dementia may be slowed or prevented by lifestyle interventions, including physical activity (PA). PA is associated with improved cognitive function and may reduce risk for dementia by mitigating known risk factors (i.e., cardiovascular diseases) and/or by enhancing neurochemical processes. An emerging area of research suggests the gut microbiome may have similar neuroprotective effects. Altering the gut microbiome has been found to target physiological processes associated with dementia risk, and it influences gut-brain-microbiome axis signaling, impacting cognitive functioning. The gut microbiome can be altered by several means (i.e., disease, diet, prebiotics, probiotics), including PA. As PA and the gut microbiome independently influence cognitive function and PA changes the composition of the gut microbiome, cognitive improvement due to PA may be partially mediated by the gut microbiome. The present article provides an overview of the literature regarding the complex associations among PA, cognitive function, and the gut microbiome, as well as their underlying biological mechanisms. A comprehensive, theoretical model integrating evidence for the potential mediation is proposed.

The population of older adults is growing worldwide. Predictions for the United States (US) suggest that the population of older adults will increase to 55 million by 2020 and to 70 million by 2030 [1]. Worldwide, there are currently 617 million older adults, a population projected to increase to 1.6 billion by 2050 [2]. In addition to being at increased risk for chronic illness [3], older adults experience cognitive aging and are at greater risk of developing disorders associated with cognitive dysfunction, such as dementia.

The current prevalence of all-cause dementia is alarmingly high. Recent estimates indicate that 46.8 million persons have dementia worldwide, a number that is projected to increase to 74.7 million by the year 2030 [21]. As prevalence of dementia is expected to increase with the world’s aging population, these changes will have a notable impact on individual and public healthcare costs.

An increasing population of older adults at greater risk for dementia has notable consequences. At the individual level, quality of life (QoL) declines with impaired cognitive abilities. QoL refers to psychological, social, and physical domains of health impacted by a person’s perceptions, beliefs, experiences, and expectations [22]. QoL can be measured using objective and subjective assessment [22]. Compared to persons without cognitive impairment, persons with MCI, those with AD, and/or those living in residential care homes report worse physical and emotional health, greater daily limitations, and less independence in daily functioning [23,24,25].

Given the increasing population of older adults and projected surges in related costs, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized dementia as a public health priority [29]. As dementia is not reversible [30] and clinical trials seeking to treat symptoms of dementia have shown little progress [31], a recent call for preventive measures has arisen [32]. Although there is no cure for dementia, some lifestyle interventions have been shown to mitigate its effects, including increasing physical activity.

The term physical activity (PA) can refer to reducing sedentary behavior, increasing light physical activity, and purposeful exercise. To promote clarity for the current review, PA is defined using metabolic equivalent units (METs). METs refer to the amount of oxygen consumed during PA; 1 MET refers to the amount of oxygen consumed at rest, typically 3.5 mL O2/kg/min [33]. MET is a simple, commonly used standard of measurement in North America that can be used to quantify energy expenditure and functional capacity, and identify safe, physical activities for individuals [33].

In addition to the health benefits obtained by decreasing SB and/or increasing light PA and exercise, PA has also been found to improve cognitive functioning. The potential mechanisms for this association are reviewed later in this text.

PA, or lack thereof, appears to significantly impact cognitive functioning in older adults. Greater amount of time spent in SB has notable, deleterious effects on middle-aged and older adults’ cognitive functioning [44,45,46]. Some interventions attempted to reduce SB using a variety of techniques (e.g., goal setting, accelerometer counts, increasing standing time) [47,48,49] which show some promise, although they largely examined feasibility and have yet to show notable results for impact on cognitive functioning [50].

There is much evidence to suggest that greater intensity of PA and increasing amount of time spent in PA are beneficial for cognitive function in older adults. Although research examining the effects of reducing SB or increasing light PA is mixed, the association between more MVPA and better cognitive function has been repeatedly confirmed.

There are several potential mechanisms that may explain the positive influence of PA on brain health and cognitive functioning in older adults, including indirect pathways involving mitigation of disease, as well as direct pathways involving promotion of neurochemical processes.

PA improves diseases and related processes known to impact cognitive functioning, including cardiovascular function, diabetes, obesity, and depression. Two cardiovascular pathways through which PA impacts cognitive function are hypertension and poor vascular function.

Exercise has also been found to improve psychological disorders associated with cognitive dysfunction, including depression. One to five percent of community-dwelling older adults and 13.5% of older adults requiring home care are thought to meet criteria for depression [14]. Depression has been associated with poorer executive functioning, processing speed, and memory in older adults [108], as well as accelerated rates of cognitive decline [109]; some research suggests depression may be a risk factor for development of dementia [110]. Exercise was found to improve depressive symptoms [111,112] with the greatest benefits identified using moderate-intensity aerobic exercise [113].

PA has also been shown to improve neurochemical processes and neuroanatomical structure. One such neurochemical is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is a neurotrophin [114] that helps regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity [115]. Reduced levels of BDNF are identified in the normal aging process [116], MCI [117], and AD [118,119], and have been associated with poorer verbal memory, information processing speed [117], and global cognitive function [120]. In mice, exercise was found to increase proteins that regulate BDNF [121]. In older adults, exercise was found to promote BDNF [122], whereas inactivity reduces it [123]. These results extend to persons with depression who show greater BDNF increases from exercise than cognitive training or mindfulness [124].

There is much evidence to suggest that PA indirectly (i.e., counteracting disease) and directly (i.e., promoting neuroanatomical processes) improves brain outcomes. A new, less studied mechanism that may also impact the brain and cognitive function is the gut microbiome.

The term “gut microbiome” refers to the catalog of microbes and their genes that dwell in the gut [150]. These microbes, also called “microbiota,” are the microbial taxa that make up the gut microbiome [150]. Whereas “microbiome” refers to the collection of genes of the microbiota, “microbiota” refers to particular species of bacteria. Determining the health of the gut microbiome is difficult considering it contains 10–100 trillion microbial cells, although some patterns have emerged with the use of DNA sequencing [151]. The gut microbiome is considered healthy when it benefits human digestive functioning and is operating in symbiosis; this occurs when there is a higher proportion of beneficial microbiota (i.e., Firmicutes) than detrimental microbiota (i.e., Bacteroidetes) with the ideal ratio being 10:1 [152]. Alternatively, the gut microbiome is considered unhealthy (i.e., in dysbiosis) when it comprises an atypical ratio of microbiota, specifically, an increase in Bacteroidetes and a decrease in Firmicutes [153]. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been associated with various pathologies known to impact cognitive function, including anxiety and depressive symptoms in animal models [154,155], MCI, and dementia [156,157], and it becomes more common with advancing age [158,159]. Like PA, the gut microbiome appears to impact cognitive function through direct and indirect pathways.

The gut microbiome impacts cognitive function through the gut-brain-microbiome axis. The gut-brain-microbiome axis is an interconnected system of communication and processes involving the gut, the brain, and the gut microbiome. Within this system, the gut microbiome engages in bidirectional signaling with the brain via manipulation of bile acids (BAs) [160] and metabolites [161].

The gut microbiome also impacts the brain through manipulation of metabolites. Metabolites are small molecules within cells that are produced when gut microbiota ferment dietary fiber [165]. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolites impact neurophysiological processes and behavior. Indirectly, SCFA metabolites induce nerve activation in the brain, affecting glucose regulation and weight control [166]. Directly, SCFA metabolites modulate neurotransmission and increase expression of enzymes, altering production of noradrenaline and dopamine [161]. Possibly through these processes, SCFA metabolites have been associated with changes in cognition and behavior. For example, injecting mice with sodium butyrate (SB; i.e., one type of SCFA) increases effort on the tail suspension task, indicating less behavioral hopelessness [167]. Additionally, injecting mice with propionic acid (i.e., another type of SCFA) increases hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors similar to those found in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [168].

The gut microbiome may also influence brain health through its effects on diseases known to impact cognitive function including obesity, inflammation, and metabolic disorders.

The gut microbiome has been linked to obesity. Persons with obesity were found to have worse gut microbiome composition than lean persons, including less gut microbial diversity [137] and higher proportions of harmful microbiota [169]. Furthermore, altering the gut microbiome impacts obesity. In mice, transferring gut microbial communities from obese to lean mice increased the amount of energy harvesting and adiposity in the lean mice [170]. In middle-aged women, consumption of Rehmannia glutinosa root (i.e., a natural probiotic that improves the gut microbiome) increased proportions of Actinobacteria and Bifidobacterium in the gut and led to reductions in waist circumference [171].

The gut microbiome also influences inflammatory responses. Worse gut microbiome composition (i.e., lower ratio of good to bad microbiota) has been linked with incidence of several gastroinflammatory diseases, including Crohn’s disease [172], irritable bowel disease, and celiac disease [173]. Persons with celiac disease were found to have higher proportions of harmful bacteria [174] and less diversity of beneficial microbiota (i.e., Bifidobacterium) [175]. These associations may be due to the impact of the gut microbiome on inflammatory processes. The gut microbiome activates immune responses associated with systemic inflammation [176]. When in dysbiosis, the gut microbiome can lead to “leaky gut,” a disorder which is so named due to increased permeability of the gut lining that allows harmful bacteria to more easily “leak” out of the gut into the bloodstream and trigger inflammation [177].

The gut microbiome is also associated with metabolic disorders. Compared with healthy children, initial onset of type 1 diabetes has been associated with notable differences in gut microbiome composition, including lower ratios of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes and increased proportions of other harmful bacteria [178]. Gut microbiome composition in toddlers with increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes is less diverse and more unstable than that found in healthy peers [179]. Persons with type 2 diabetes show increased likelihood for gut dysbiosis and greater proportions of pathogens [180]. Improving gut microbiome composition with probiotic supplementation was found to reduce biomarkers associated with metabolic disorders (i.e., fasting glucose, fasting plasma insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)) [181], and use of prebiotic supplementation has been associated with increased biomarkers indicative of improved metabolic functioning (i.e., C-peptide) [182].

Despite being in the early stages of research, there is much initial evidence to suggest that the gut microbiome directly and indirectly impacts brain health through gut-brain-microbiome axis signaling and modulation of disease-related processes known to influence cognitive functioning. Given these associations, perhaps modification of the gut microbiome could be used to improve cognitive function.

Despite evidence for some long-term stability in the composition of the gut microbiome accounted for by race and geographical location [183,184,185], it is also changeable. For one, the gut microbiome changes during disease states. Persons with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease show an increased abundance of harmful bacteria in the gut microbiome (i.e., Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp.) [186], and individuals with Clostridium difficile infection or irritable bowel disease often show gut dysbiosis and reduced microbial diversity [187].

In sum, the gut microbiome can be altered through several means including disease, diet, prebiotics, and probiotics. PA also appears to modify the composition of the gut microbiome.

Cross-sectional research has identified associations between gut microbiome composition and physical fitness. In healthy young adults, those with better physical fitness [i.e., maximal oxygen uptake (VO2)] show greater taxonomic richness [212] and increased ratios of beneficial microbiota (i.e., Firmicutes) to harmful microbiota (i.e., Bacteroidetes) [213]. Conversely, greater proportions of detrimental microbiota were identified in young to middle-aged individuals with poorer physical fitness [214].

There appears to be a positive association between gut microbiome composition and PA, such that more PA/better physical fitness is associated with, and can improve, the gut microbiome. Although this relationship has been largely studied in animal models, initial studies with humans have begun replicating these promising findings.

PA may improve the gut microbiome through modification of BAs, metabolites, gut permeability, and interactions with butyrate and mitochondria [188,219,220], each of which has bidirectional effects with the gut microbiome.

Initial evidence suggests several mechanisms through which PA may improve the gut microbiome, including alteration of BAs, metabolites, improving gut permeability, and interactions with butyrate and mitochondria. Through PA and other means, it appears that improving the gut microbiome may impact cognitive function.

Like PA, the gut microbiome appears to have independent effects on cognitive function. Improvements to the gut microbiome, irrespective of PA, have been associated with better markers of brain health and cognitive outcomes.

In mouse models, prebiotic and probiotic supplementation has been found to modify the gut microbiome and subsequently improve brain health and cognitive outcomes. Rats that are given prebiotics after surgery showed greater gut microbiome beta diversity, reduced inflammatory markers, and better performance on objective memory tasks compared with controls [252]. These findings suggest the inflammatory effects thought to induce postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) may be ameliorated by improving the gut microbiome [252]. Probiotics appear to confer similar benefits. AD mice that consumed probiotics showed reduced hippocampal inflammatory expression and immune-reactive genes which are typically induced by Aβ, as well as improved performance on tasks of learning and memory [253]. Furthermore, prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics (i.e., combination of prebiotics and probiotics) were all shown to improve gut dysbiosis, physiological processes associated with cognitive dysfunction (i.e., systemic inflammation, insulin sensitivity), hippocampal plasticity, and cognitive performance in high-fat diet-fed rats [254].

Improvement of the gut microbiome also appears to benefit brain health and cognitive function in humans. In persons with MCI, the Mediterranean diet (i.e., diet including high amounts of fruits, vegetables, grains, and healthy fats, commonly recommended to protect brain health) [255] was found to improve gut microbiome composition by reducing proportions of microbiota associated with the development of Aβ [256]. In persons with cirrhosis and cognitive dysfunction (Román et al., 2019) or fibromyalgia [257], consumption of probiotics led to significantly improved performance on cognitive tasks compared with controls. Furthermore, probiotics were found to alleviate psychological distress in healthy adults [258], as well as improve anxiety symptoms and increase the number and amount of strains/species belonging to beneficial microbiota (i.e., Lactobacillus, Bifidobacteria) in persons with chronic fatigue syndrome [259].

As alteration of the gut microbiome via methods other than PA (i.e., diet, prebiotics, probiotics) was found to benefit cognitive function, this suggests that the gut microbiome independently impacts the brain.

The independent effects of the gut microbiome on cognitive function are also supported by research showing that improving gut microbiome composition plus exercise leads to greater cognitive improvement than exercise alone. In transgenic AD mice engaged in 20 weeks of exercise, probiotic consumption, or both, mice who exercised or consumed probiotics showed decreased neuroanatomical markers of AD (i.e., number of beta amyloid plaques in the hippocampus), while only mice in the exercise plus probiotic group showed better cognitive performance on a visuospatial memory task as well [260]. Similar results have been identified in humans. In older adults who completed 12 weeks of resistance exercise training plus consumption of probiotic or placebo, persons in the exercise plus probiotic group showed significantly improved performance on a test of inhibition, reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms, and decreased BMI compared with those in the exercise plus placebo group [261]. Combining PA with additional means to improve gut microbiome composition appears to benefit cognitive function more than exercise alone.

Provided these results, as well as the previously discussed effects of PA on the gut microbiome, it appears likely that the effects of PA on cognitive function are at least partially explained by changes to the gut microbiome.

Some researchers have posited that the gut microbiome may mediate the effects of PA on cognitive function, but no study has examined it appropriately or proposed a complete model. In a brief report, Yuan et al., 2015, reviewed evidence supporting the influence of the gut microbiome on emotion and cognition, as well as the bidirectional associations between the gut microbiome and physical fitness. Although the report suggested that the influence of exercise on the gut microbiome may lead to changes in cognitive function, no conceptual model was offered [262]. A recent systematic review by Schlegel et al., 2019, provided comprehensive evidence for associations among exercise, the gut microbiome, and cognitive function, as well as a description of proposed mechanisms underlying these interactions. The review concluded that altering the gut microbiome using exercise interventions could improve cognitive function in persons with AD and offered recommendations for future research [263]. However, the review was only theoretical in nature and did not propose a conceptual model or study outline.

Two previous studies examining the independent and combined roles of manipulation of the gut microbiome and PA on cognitive function were described earlier in this text [260,261]. Although these studies offered promising findings regarding the effects of the gut microbiome and PA on cognitive function and brain health, neither study contained enough information to determine whether the gut microbiome mediates the effects of PA on cognitive function.

Although the abovementioned studies examined some of the associations among PA, cognitive function, and the gut microbiome, their respective methodologies did not lead to clear conclusions about whether the gut microbiome mediates the relationship between PA and cognitive function. Furthermore, although the potential mediation was discussed in theoretical contexts, a comprehensive model integrating the complex associations among PA, the gut microbiome, and cognitive function, as well as their respective and related underlying biological mechanisms, has not yet been offered. To address this gap, a detailed theoretical model representing the potential mediation of the relationship between PA and cognitive function by the gut microbiome, as well as methodology to appropriately test the model, is described next.

There is ample evidence to suggest that PA impacts cognitive function. Numerous interventions have shown that exercise benefits the brain by reducing risk of/symptoms associated with various diseases (i.e., cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, depression) and/or by increasing neurochemicals (i.e., BDNF, IGF-1) and related neuronal growth processes (i.e., neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, angiogenesis). Novel research proposes that the gut microbiome may impact cognitive function as well. Similar to PA, the gut microbiome has been found to benefit the brain by countering disease-related processes associated with cognitive dysfunction (i.e., obesity, inflammation, metabolic disorders) and by altering molecular activities (i.e., BAs, metabolites) that promote helpful gut-brain-microbiome axis signaling. The composition of the gut microbiome is malleable and can be improved through several different means (i.e., disease, diet, prebiotics, probiotics). There is also evidence to suggest that the gut microbiome is modifiable by PA, potentially through alteration of BAs, metabolites, and gut permeability. Improving the gut microbiome has been found to have beneficial psychological and cognitive effects.

If PA and the gut microbiome have independent effects on cognitive function, and if PA changes the composition of the gut microbiome, the gut microbiome may mediate the relationship between PA and cognitive function. The gut microbiome and PA appear to share some overlapping pathways known to impact cognitive function (i.e., disease-related processes, diseases associated with cognitive dysfunction), as well as unique pathways that either do not overlap or have not yet been connected to one another (i.e., respective effects on different neurochemical processes). As the gut microbiome and PA respectively influence unique processes associated with cognitive function, and as the gut microbiome can be altered by means other than exercise, the potential mediating effect of the gut microbiome on the relationship between PA and cognitive function is likely partial, not complete.

Given the evidence reviewed thus far, a proposed model of the partial mediation of the relationship between PA and cognitive function by the gut microbiome is described below.

There are pathways currently established by the literature describing the processes through which PA improves cognitive function. These established pathways directly link PA with diseases and brain-related processes known to impact cognitive function. PA reduces the risk of developing diseases and disorders (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, depression) associated with cognitive dysfunction. PA also improves neurochemical (i.e., BDNF, IGF-1) and structural processes (i.e., neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, angiogenesis) that promote brain health and cognitive function. Through these established pathways, cognitive function appears to be protected and/or enhanced by PA.

Although less studied, there are also independent pathways connecting the gut microbiome with cognitive function. The composition of the gut microbiome can be altered by disease, diet, prebiotics, or probiotics. When these factors improve the gut microbiome, it subsequently reduces disease-related processes (e.g., inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, adiposity) associated with cognitive dysfunction. When the gut microbiome is in symbiosis, it also promotes healthy signaling with the brain along the gut-brain-microbiome axis by altering molecular processes (e.g., BAs, metabolites). Through these pathways, the gut microbiome appears to impact brain health and cognitive outcomes.

There are two possible processes through which the influence of PA on cognitive function may be mediated by the gut microbiome. The first proposed mediation pathway involves the influence of the gut microbiome on processes within the established associations among PA, disease, and cognitive function (i.e., established pathways). The second proposed mediation pathway connects PA with cognitive function through PA-induced changes to the gut microbiome (i.e., novel pathways). Each type of pathway is detailed below (See Figure A1, Appendix A).

The gut microbiome may mediate the relationship between PA and the brain along pathways previously established in the literature. PA appears to improve cognitive function along two primary pathways: (1) reducing risk for/symptoms of diseases associated with cognitive dysfunction, and (2) improving neurochemical processing and structural changes in the brain. It is possible that PA’s effects on the gut microbiome contribute to one of these pathways. Improving the composition of the gut microbiome (using PA or other means) has been found to mitigate disease-related processes associated with cognitive dysfunction (i.e., inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, adiposity). These physiological processes are often manifestations of and/or exacerbate diseases known to impair cognitive function (i.e., obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression). As such, by improving disease-related processes, the gut microbiome also counters the diseases themselves. If one of the primary pathways linking PA to cognitive function is through reduction of disease, and PA impacts gut microbiome health which also mitigates aspects of similar diseases, perhaps the effects of this pathway, originally thought to be a clear link between PA and cognitive function, are partially accounted for by PA’s influence on the gut microbiome. If accurate, this interpretation suggests that the respective effects of PA and the gut microbiome on disease may overlap such that the gut microbiome partially mediates the pathway connecting PA to disease and cognitive function.

The gut microbiome may also mediate the relationship between PA and the brain along novel pathways not previously linked to PA. It has been posited that the gut microbiome influences the brain through two primary means: (1) improving disease-related processes deleterious to brain health, and (2) altering gut-brain-microbiome axis signaling. PA improves the composition of the gut microbiome by altering BAs, gut permeability, and metabolites. In doing so, PA may spur changes in the gut microbiome that produce a cascading effect along the two primary pathways connecting the gut microbiome with cognitive function (i.e., ameliorating disease-related processes, altering gut-brain-microbiome axis signaling). As such, in addition to its independent effects on cognitive function, PA’s influence on the brain and cognitive outcomes may also be partially accounted for by its manipulation of the gut microbiome along these novel pathways.

In sum, the proposed mediation model of the effects of PA on cognitive function by the gut microbiome acknowledges the respective pathways connecting PA and the gut microbiome to the brain. Additionally, the model includes new, mediation pathways reflecting the influence of PA on the gut microbiome and its subsequent impact on the brain along previously established and/or novel pathways.

To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed mediation model, future research should examine key features of the model and utilize statistical analyses that allow detection of partial mediation. The most appropriate study design that would enable investigation of these key features would be a randomized clinical trial.

To support the proposed mediation model, a study would need to include the following: (1) examination of all respective pathways of the model (i.e., PA to cognitive function, gut microbiome to cognitive function, PA to gut microbiome), (2) appropriate measures of key elements of the model (e.g., DNA sequencing for gut microbiome composition, neuropsychological testing for cognitive function), (3) longitudinal study design to track changes in each of the key elements over time, and (4) mediation analyses to determine which variables account for potential change in outcomes of interest (i.e., gut microbiome composition, cognitive performance). Including these requisites would allow adequate examination of the associations between changes in PA and the gut microbiome, and their effects on cognitive function. If it were discovered that changes to PA were associated with changes to the gut microbiome and cognitive function, and that changes to the gut microbiome accounted for some of the change in cognitive function associated with PA, this would support the proposed mediation model.

A 2 × 2, placebo-controlled, 12-month randomized clinical trial (RCT) in older adults would be the most appropriate study design to determine whether the gut microbiome partially mediates the effects of PA on cognitive function. An RCT design reduces the risk of baseline group differences and increases the likelihood that results would be due to the intervention alone. Including a placebo reduces risk of participant expectation bias and allows clear examination of the effects of the intervention. A 2 (PA vs. no PA) × 2 (probiotic vs. placebo) design would allow examination of the multiple pathways of the proposed model, including direct associations between PA and cognitive function, between PA and the gut microbiome, between probiotics and the gut microbiome, and between the gut microbiome and cognitive function. MVPA has been consistently associated with [58,59] and found to improve [60,61,62] cognitive function. As such, MVPA would likely be the best intervention to maximize the likelihood of detecting changes to the gut microbiome and cognitive functioning. To alter the gut microbiome in a manner independent of MVPA, probiotic supplementation may be optimal. Unlike some other methods of altering the gut microbiome (e.g., changing diet), probiotic supplementation is a convenient and controlled method for altering gut microbiome composition; probiotics are easily quantifiable [264] and are simple to administer and consume [202]. To increase the likelihood that the intervention would produce detectable change in cognitive function, the trial should last 12 months (i.e., amount of time previously found appropriate for identifying cognitive change) [265,266].

As older adults have poorer gut microbiome composition compared to young adults [152], are at greater risk of developing diseases associated with cognitive dysfunction [10], and experience cognitive aging [4], they have more room for gut microbiome and cognitive improvement. Their inclusion as the primary sample would likely improve the chances of causing and detecting related changes. Given the differences in prevalence of diseases known to impact cognitive function and the gut microbiome between ethnic/racial groups (e.g., dementia, hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes) [97,237,267,268,269,270], as well as evidence suggesting stable differences in gut microbiome composition due to geographic location and ethnicity/race [184,185], the recruitment of a diverse sample may aid examination of the potential effects of these respective factors on outcomes. Outcomes should include measures representative of the different pathways of the proposed mediation model, including cognitive function (i.e., cognitive testing, diagnosis of MCI, AD, VaD), indicators of brain health (e.g., BDNF, brain volume), indicators of disease [e.g., BMI, glucose, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)], and gut microbiome composition (i.e., DNA sequencing for amounts/proportions of gut microbiota).

The possibility that the gut microbiome mediates the relationship between PA and cognitive function has important clinical implications. For instance, if the model is supported, it is likely that the effects of PA on cognitive function could be further enhanced by concurrent/adjuvant interventions to improve the gut microbiome. Both animal [260] and human trials [261] showed that probiotic supplementation and PA in tandem leads to greater improvements in cognitive function than using either intervention alone. This suggests that the cognitive benefits of PA could be augmented by concurrently improving the health of the gut microbiome using alternative methods.

The proposed mediation model also suggests that altering the gut microbiome through interventions other than PA may lead to meaningful cognitive benefits. Diet, prebiotics, and probiotics were all shown to improve gut microbiome composition, and evidence suggests that these changes additionally impact cognitive function [185,252,253,254,255,256]. As some of the cognitive benefits of PA are attributable to the gut microbiome and novel research shows the independent effects of the gut microbiome on cognitive function, altering the gut microbiome through methods other than PA (such as those described above) should also lead to cognitive gains. This finding would have considerable societal benefit, as many older adults are unable to exercise due to health or mobility issues [3,271]. Additionally, although much more research on the interactions of race/ethnicity, social determinants of health (SDOH), health outcomes, and dementia needs to be conducted and integrated into the proposed model before making informed predictions, the potential cognitive benefits gained by improving the gut microbiome without PA may feasibly extend to racial/ethnic groups who also experience limited PA due discrepancies in SDOH (e.g., less access to community amenities, less spending money for gym memberships, lower school-level SES) [272,273,274,275] and experience increased risk of dementia [267,268,276]. Thus, safe and easy methods (i.e., probiotic supplementation) that change the gut microbiome may be useful alternatives to PA that confer similar cognitive benefits.

This review proposed a mediation model representing what is currently known about the interactions among PA, the gut microbiome, and the brain. The proposed mediation model attempts to depict the multiple pathways connecting these factors, to what degree the pathways overlap, and the various biological mechanisms involved; it is evidently complex. Even so, the model in its present form does not yet include additional factors (e.g., race/ethnicity, SDOH, geography) that would likely interact with the proposed pathways, suggesting there is still much to be studied. Nonetheless, the possibility that the gut microbiome may mediate the relationship between PA and cognitive function offers new insights into the effects of PA on the brain and the less understood effects of the gut microbiome. Although the potential implications of this model are dependent on future research, they may inform the development of cognitive function interventions that enhance or replicate the effects of PA on the brain, particularly for older adults.
