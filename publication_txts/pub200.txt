A Bibliometric Review on Gut Microbiome and Alzheimer’s Disease Between 2012 and 2021



Research on the microbiome has drawn an increasing amount of attention over the past decade. Even more so for its association with disease. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have been a subject of study for a long time with slow success in improving diagnostic accuracy or identifying a possibility for treatment. In this work, we analyze past and current research on microbiome and its positive impact on AD treatment and diagnosis. We present a bibliometric analysis from 2012 to 2021 with data retrieved on September 2, 2021, from the Scopus database. The query includes “Gut AND (Microbiota OR Microbiome) AND Alzheimer*” within the article title, abstract, and keywords for all kinds of documents in the database. Compared with 2016, the number of publications (NPs) on the subject doubled by 2017. Moreover, we observe an exponential growth through 2020, and with the data presented, it is almost certain that it will continue this trend and grow even further in the upcoming years. We identify key journals interested in the subject and discuss the articles with most citations, analyzing trends and topics for future research, such as the ability to diagnose the disease and complement the cognitive test with other clinical biomarkers. According to the test, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is normally considered an initial stage for AD. This test, combined with the role of the gut microbiome in early stages of the disease, may improve the diagnostic accuracy. Based on our findings, there is emerging evidence that microbiota, perhaps more specifically gut microbiota, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diseases, such as AD.

In November of 1906, during the 37th Meeting of the Society of Southwest German Psychiatrists in Tubingen, Germany—Alois Alzheimer first described the disease that bears his name (Lage, 2006; Valleix, 2007). A year later, the article entitled “About a peculiar disease of the cerebral cortex” was published (Stelzmann et al., 1995; Strassnig and Ganguli, 2005). Since then, the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) hallmark pathology has been extensively studied, leading to a variety of explanations. One such explanation, and perhaps the most widely accepted to date, is that AD develops as a result of an accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein fragments outside neurons. These fragments in turn may contribute to cell death by interfering with neuron-to-neuron communication at synapses, and as hyperphosphorylated tau tangles within neurons, blocking the transport of nutrients and other essential molecules inside neurons (Alzheimer’s Association, 2019). Finding an explanation for these pathologies could mean finding a treatment, however, a comprehensive understanding of the etiopathogenesis has not yet been elucidated, directly impacting the failure of several clinical trials (Tobore, 2019). Among several hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the causes of AD, we have: the amyloid hypothesis, calcium homeostasis hypothesis, cholinergic hypothesis, inflammatory hypothesis, lymphatic system hypothesis, metal ion hypothesis, mitochondrial cascade hypothesis, neurovascular hypothesis, and tau propagation hypothesis (Liu et al., 2019). Thus far, they have not yielded a definite treatment or prevention strategy, but they have led to novel approaches that could potentially explain AD.

It is important to keep track of the advances and the contributions from clinicians and basic scientists so that improved diagnosis and better treatments can be developed. In this study, we summarize through a bibliometric approach the most recent, highly cited research, the countries with the highest contribution, and in general, a landscape of published work on the relationship between the gut microbiome and AD during the last decade. Bibliometric analyses are tools that allow for a statistical examination of scientific publications. They mainly help in defining past and future trends on certain research topics (Kokol et al., 2021). They also allow researchers to perform a more in-depth analysis of the collaborations between authors, countries, and understand the impact of scientific publications within the research community (Kutluk and Danis, 2021). While several bibliometric analyses have been published regarding AD (Sorensen, 2009; Song et al., 2015; Serrano-Pozo et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2019; Schilder et al., 2020), none of them tackles the topic of the relationship between the disease and the gut microbiome. Since this is one of the most novel and strong theories in AD pathology development, it is of utter importance to find future trends that could guide researchers to develop new studies.

Data were retrieved on 2 September 2021, from the Scopus database. The query used was “Gut AND (Microbiota OR Microbiome) AND Alzheimer*” within the article title, its abstract, and its keywords for all the documents in the database. This means that we queried all publications with the words gut, either microbiota or microbiome, and the term Alzheimer’s with any type of ending (e.g., Alzheimer, Alzheimers, and Alzheimer’s).

Documents were then filtered by language, including only articles written in English, and then by type, considering not only original articles, but also reviews, conference papers, conference reviews, and letters. A PRISMA 2020 flow diagram (Page et al., 2021) depicting the flow of information through the different phases of the analysis can be found in Figure 1. Quantitative and qualitative analyses, such as citation information (e.g., author(s), document title, and year); bibliographical information (e.g., affiliations and publisher); abstract and keywords (e.g., author keywords and index keywords); funding details and other characteristics were extracted using the export document settings in the Scopus database.

All analyses carried out in this study were performed with the help of the open-source R package bibliometrix (Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017).

A total of 610 publications on the relationship between the gut microbiome and AD were found between 2012 and 2021, namely, 318 reviews, 288 original articles, 2 letters, 1 conference paper, and 1 conference review. Descriptive information regarding the collection can be consulted in Table 1 and the year-wise distribution of these publications is shown in Figure 2.

According to the regression analysis results, it was estimated that 380 and 688 articles would be published in 2021 and 2022, respectively.

Table 2 shows the top 11 sources that generated most of the publications in the study, specifying the number of publications (NPs), total number of citations (TC), h-index, and the year of the first publication for that source (YFP).

We can see that these journals contribute approximately 25% of the scientific knowledge on the matter. It is important to highlight, however, that even though the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, and Nutrients have 25, 23, and 21 publications, respectively (+ 3% each), Scientific Reports amassed the most citations (1,461). Further analysis on the primary focus of the most relevant sources revealed that this is indeed an interdisciplinary research field. For instance, the source with the most publications, International Journal of Molecular Sciences, provides an advanced forum for all aspects of molecular research in chemistry. The Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease has principal concerns on the etiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, genetics, behavior, treatment, and psychology of AD. Nutrients Journal is related to human nutrition with subject areas, such as macronutrients, micronutrients, functional foods, diet-related disorders, and malnutrition. Scientific Reports has a broader scope and publishes original research from all areas of the natural and clinical sciences. As expected, Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience is more focused on the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of central nervous system and aging as well as other age-related neural diseases, but recently, through research topics, which are peer-reviewed article collections around cutting-edge research themes, articles related to the gut microbiome and AD have been published.

The top 10 countries according to the NPs are listed in Table 3. The worldwide scenario when it comes to AD and gut microbiome is led by three countries: the United States of America (456), China (446), and Italy (226). It is worth noting that percentages do not add up to 100 because, as it will be discussed in the next subsection, a publication could have authors with affiliations from different countries. Figure 4 visually details this metric for all countries.

Among the top four countries in our collection with 610 articles, the major relationships were United States of America-China 18; United States of America-Canada 6; United States of America-Germany 6; and United States of America-United Kingdom 6 as depicted in Figure 6. In this figure, only collaborations with a minimum of three articles were presented. In 2019, at the Lausanne Workshop on AD, the idea of worldwide collaboration was presented. The aim was to develop a global mechanism of action for a better diagnosis and to accelerate research on the drug development that can efficiently treat AD for all people in all places. In 2021, the Davos Alzheimer’s Collaborative launched a global partnership with international organizations from governments and the private sector mobilizing the world against AD. Today, it is recognized that we need a global effort to tackle AD. We would expect to see more pink lines in this map in the following years.

Out of the 610 articles published in the 2012–2021 period on the gut microbiome and AD, the top ten articles that received the most citations are shown in Table 4. It is worth noting that, even though Scientific Reports had the highest number of citations per source, it fell to 4th place in this table.

YP stands for year of publication.

Thus far, we have analyzed the state-of-the-art of published research in AD and microbiota. Another important piece of information is to capture trending topics so future research on AD could focus on emerging priorities for this disease. To uncover trending topics, the titles of the articles in the most recent publications were analyzed through trigrams. Results shown in Figure 7 indicate that trending topics seem to be related to human gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids, and fecal microbiota transplantation. However, it is also worth mentioning that mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an early stage of memory loss or other cognitive ability loss and a condition that is known to be the prelude to AD, is also trending.

Mild cognitive impairment was a trendy term in 2019 and remains somewhat active, followed by the central nervous system, which does not seem to have the same impact in 2021. There has been an effort to address AD through metabolic changes and even databases, such as the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) fully devoted to this approach. However, it is clear that human gut microbiota has today’s attention and that this can get even trendier due to the success of therapies that use fecal microbiota transplantation.

The conceptual structure represents relations among concepts or words in a set of publications. It is what scientists talk about, the main themes and trends. We performed a factorial analysis—a data reduction technique that serves as a filter of terms that are mostly redundant or of low frequency on the KeyWords Plus. Reduction is achieved by selecting terms that represent a linear combination of other redundant terms through multiple correspondence analysis. Figure 8 is shown below.

Here, the proximity between words is because a large proportion of articles use them together, and the origin of the map represents the average position of all column profiles and therefore represents the center of the research field (Cuccurullo et al., 2016).

Research on microbiome has drawn an increasing amount of attention over the past decade. Even more so for its association with disease. On the other hand, AD has been a subject of study for a longer time with a lack of success in improving diagnostic accuracy or a possibility for treatment. Based on our findings, there is emerging evidence that microbiome—perhaps more specifically the gut microbiome—is a key player in the pathogenesis of diseases, such as AD. In the case of microbiome and AD, a significant number of scientific publications have been published lately. From a selection of 610 scientific contributions in the fields in a Scopus search, we found 52.13% review articles, 47.21% original research articles, and an almost a negligible percentage of conference papers. Compared with 2016, we identified an important increase in 2017 only to double the number of papers in 1 year. Nevertheless, it was just a starting point that led to an exponential growth by 2020 and, with the data presented, it is almost certain that it will continue this trend and grow even further in the upcoming years. Our projections estimate that 2021 will end with almost 400 papers in the subject while this number will almost get to 700 in 2022.

Some gut microorganisms have already been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of AD, such as Lactobacillus spp. beneficial to brain functions leading to an optimistic therapy to improve cognitive function (John et al., 2021). Other researchers correlate periodontal hygiene and microbial composition in the mouth to the development of the disease, suggesting a possible therapeutic in the future (Ryder and Xenoudi, 2021). Metabolic diseases have already addressed the role of prebiotics as modifiable factors in insulin resistance diseases with products, such as grenade juice in some patients with the presence of enzymes as urolithin A (Li et al., 2015). The use of non-antibiotic medications has also been described as a gut microbiome modulator; it has even been tried as a novel therapeutic agent. Research within this subject has shown that atorvastatin, a drug from the statins family, can be used to treat hypercholesterolemia and prevent cardiac disease by modifying the gut microbe composition diminishing proinflammatory species and increasing anti-inflammation ones, such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (Khan et al., 2018). Dietary interventions and the supplementation with probiotics of the studied bacteria or other commensal organisms are known to increase the target inside the gut and have been widely explored in metabolic diseases, cancer (Huang et al., 2019), and neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (Mirza et al., 2020) and epilepsy (Dooling and Costa-Mattioli, 2018).

The role of microorganisms in non-infectious diseases has been growing in recent years. A case of pathogenesis of virus in Epstein-Barr or bacteria, such as Helicobacter pylori and its association to gastric cancer and gastritis are only two examples. We are now entering an era in which the question is no longer whether or not the microbiome has an impact on human health. Investigations in AD are beginning to open into this field, and we are at the start of an exponential growth in knowledge generation as well as hope for accurate diagnosis and treatment for AD. This work presents a trending analysis of emerging topics addressing AD. Some will not only remain in the upcoming years but may become the future for new drugs and a step forward toward precision medicine. Microbiota composition varies largely from person to person and even more so from population to population, mainly because of diet and lifestyles. Hence, studies focusing merely on microbiota composition may not be sufficient. There should be an increase in longitudinal studies with follow-ups that evaluate treatments and response and in before-and-after alpha and beta diversities of microbes. Research into whether dysbiosis can be treated with fecal transplantation, the use of prebiotics or probiotics. We know AD is highly correlated to metabolism, and in turn, metabolism is driven primarily by the microbiota. We expect this work not only presents a summary of what has been done so far but it will serve as an insight into the future possibilities of AD treatment.
