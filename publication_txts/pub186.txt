Gut microbiome and health: mechanistic insights

The gut microbiota is now considered as one of the key elements contributing to the regulation of host health. Virtually all our body sites are colonised by microbes suggesting different types of crosstalk with our organs. Because of the development of molecular tools and techniques (ie, metagenomic, metabolomic, lipidomic, metatranscriptomic), the complex interactions occurring between the host and the different microorganisms are progressively being deciphered. Nowadays, gut microbiota deviations are linked with many diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis, intestinal bowel diseases (IBDs) and several types of cancer. Thus, suggesting that various pathways involved in immunity, energy, lipid and glucose metabolism are affected.

Altogether, understanding the complexity and the molecular aspects linking gut microbes to health will help to set the basis for novel therapies that are already being developed.

The human microbiome is considered here as the collection of microbes, their genes and their products that colonise our body since birth and are transferred vertically.1 2 While all body sites are colonised (figure 1), the highest microbial numbers are found in the gut that has been studied extensively.3 Here, we review the main and most recent findings that address the way gut microbes, their activities and mediator molecules can contribute to our health.

Although there is an evident vertical gradient in the gut, a horizontal gradient also exists and has been studied most extensively in the colon. Importantly, there exist oxygen, redox and mucus gradients that starts at the mucosal surface and stretches to the lumen, resulting in architecture of the microbial communities.33 Broadly speaking, these start with mucus-degrading consortia that are usually dominated by the mucolytic and microaerophilic Akkermansia muciniphila and end with strictly anaerobic communities, including butyrate-producing and propionate-producing Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroidia as well as homoacetogens and methanogens that convert hydrogen and carbon dioxide into acetate or methane, respectively.

The gut microbiome has been associated with several intestinal and extraintestinal disorders.34 Many large studies investigating the gut microbiome and its relevance have been performed in specific gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as intestinal bowel diseases (IBDs),35 coeliac disease,36 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),37 colorectal cancer (CRC),38 chronic liver diseases39 40 or pancreatic disorders.41 42 IBDs, prototypic inflammatory disorders of the intestine, are associated with deviating gut microbiome composition and indeed facultative anaerobes outgrow have been reported, especially in the context of active inflammation and metabolite disturbances including BAs, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and acylcarnitine pathways.35 Longitudinal analysis in infants at risk for coeliac disease, another frequent inflammatory intestinal disorder, demonstrated an increased presence of several microbial species such as Dialister invisus, Parabacteroides spp or Lachnospiraceae and certain metabolites such as tryptophan metabolites before disease onset whereas various anti-inflammatory strains such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii or Clostridium clostridioforme were decreased.36 IBS, a frequent functional disorder of the GI tract, has been associated with IBS subtype-specific changes in the gut microbiome and related metabolites, with purine metabolism being especially affected.37 CRC, the most common malignancy in the lower gut, has been convincingly correlated with a disturbed gut microbiome and implicated certain bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Escherichia coli or Bacteroides fragilis, some of which are derived from the oral microbiome.38 Chronic liver diseases, especially advanced liver diseases such as liver cirrhosis, are characterised by profound microbial aberrations and data from interventional studies with prebiotics, probiotics and antibiotics have well established that the gut microbiome plays a key role in these diseases.40 Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, an increasingly recognised malignancy in the Western world, has also been linked to an impaired gut microbiome as intratumoral microbiome composition affects the host immune response and natural history of the disease.42

The gut microbiome has been extensively investigated in the past years in obesity and obesity-related disorders such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Many studies have tried to link an altered gut microbiome to obesity and indeed interventional studies with certain bacterial strains such as Akkermansia muciniphila have shown effects on obesity-related parameters.43 T2D has also been characterised by an impaired gut microbiome in Asian and European populations.44 45 In T2D, microbial variations were strongly correlated with the presence of insulin resistance and several studies implied that the gut microbiome affects glucose regulation.46 NAFLD is currently the most common chronic liver disease in the Western world and is considered a prototypic metabolic disorder at the interface of obesity, metabolic syndrome and T2D. There is growing evidence that the gut microbiome-liver axis plays a role in NAFLD, especially in cases of fibrosis and progression towards more advanced disease stages, such as non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis.47 Several studies have now demonstrated that NAFLD is characterised by a bloom in certain Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli and a decrease in F. prausnitzii. Recent data also suggest that in NAFLD microbiome deviations and instability may exist over many years and might even precede development of NAFLD and T2D.48 There is a growing number of GI and metabolic disorders where the gut microbiome has been investigated (see table 1 for an overview).

The gut bacterial community plays an important role in the regulation of multiple aspects of metabolic disorders. This regulation depends, among other things, on the production of a wide variety of metabolites by the microbiota and on their interactions with receptors on host cells that can activate or inhibit signalling pathways, and either be beneficial and detrimental to the host’s health (figure 2).

The abundance and availability of these metabolites are dependent on the microbial composition and are therefore subject to modulation by diet and environmental factors.49–51 The main molecular actors are discussed below.

The small intestine is highly specialised in the breakdown, emulsification and absorption of nutrients and few nutrients will escape digestion. In normal conditions, for example, <5 g/day of fat will reach the colon. The same principle is true for the digestion and absorption of simple carbohydrates (broken down into sugar molecules) and most proteins (converted into amino acids), although, depending on the level of intake, some proteins will reach the colon. Conversely, complex carbohydrates, such as dietary fibres are non-digestible, meaning that the body lacks the necessary enzymes to digest them allowing them to escape digestion in the small intestine. In the colon, however, they can be used as an energy source by specific resident bacteria. Various gut microbes will contribute to the metabolisation of these non-digestible carbohydrates into different SCFAs molecules (eg, acetate, butyrate and propionate). SCFAs are chemically well-characterised and their impact on health has already been extensively documented.52–54 These compounds regulate numerous metabolic pathways in the gut and at distance such as in the liver, the adipose tissue, the muscles and the brain (figure 3).55–57 Nowadays, these microbial metabolites are known to contribute to numerous physiological effects ranging from the modulation of energy homeostasis, glucose/lipid metabolism, inflammation and even immunity and cancer.52

Besides propionate and butyrate, the impact of succinate is also being investigated. Succinate is best known as an intermediate of the Krebs cycle and considered as a substrate for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, but is also a metabolic product from bacteria. In this context, succinate has been classically ignored because it was considered as being mainly a key intermediate in propionate synthesis. Currently, the role of succinate remains largely a matter of debate89 as there have been reports of both beneficial and opposite associations between succinate and insulin resistance, obesity and inflammation.90–93

The gut barrier is a complex and dynamic collection of physical and chemical structures that surveil the environment and protects the host from microbial invaders and harmful stimuli. Some of these hazardous components coming from the environment are the so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), of which bacterial LPS are the prototypical class.94

Although many questions remain to be answered before we have a full understanding of how PAMS/DAMPS, PRRs, the microbiome and disease state interact, our growing understanding of this complex interplay is opening new therapeutic possibilities for inflammation-dependent disorders.

Over the last two decades, the eCB system has been widely explored because of its extensive range of physiological effects. Among its pleiotropic effects, the eCB signalling system appears to play a key role in regulating energy, glucose and lipid metabolism but also in immunity, inflammation and more recently in microbiota-host interactions.108 109

In conclusion, all evidence points towards a bidirectional cross-talk between the host’s eCB system and the gut microbiota. However, further investigations are warranted to untangle the many remaining mysteries of this relationship. Adding to the complexity, it has recently been shown that the gut microbiota itself is able to produce specific eCBs.127 This opens new exiting opportunities of exploring the microbiota to host interaction and offers several novel putative targets for therapy.

Primary BAs, such as cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in humans (and muricholic acid (MCA) in rodents), are amphipathic molecules synthesised in the liver from cholesterol.128 They can be conjugated to glycine or taurine prior to their secretion into bile and storage in the gallbladder. When food is ingested, BAs are released into the small intestine where they assist in the digestion and absorption of dietary fat. Around 95% of intestinal BAs are reabsorbed in the ileum to return to the liver for re-secretion. This enterohepatic circulation of BAs occurs several times a day and is an important physiological mechanism for maintaining whole body glucose, lipid and energy homeostasis to prevent hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and obesity, and it protects against inflammatory metabolic diseases of the digestive and cardiovascular systems.129 Only a small fraction of the BAs will escape this highly efficient loop and reach the colon. These BAs are then either reabsorbed passively into the circulation or excreted via the faeces. The losses in BAs are compensated by de novo hepatic synthesis, which is regulated by fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF19) in humans signalling in the small intestine (FGF15 in rodents).

Primary BAs are susceptible to be modified by gut microbes all along the intestinal tract. These modifications include deconjugation (the removal of amino acid residues) via bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity and further metabolisation via removal of hydroxyl groups (dehydroxylation), oxidation (dehydrogenation) or epimerisation.135 136 This results in the formation of secondary BAs such as deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid (a secondary BA in humans, although a primary BA in rodents). This bacterial metabolism changes the bioavailability and bioactivities of BAs, and consequently their impact on the metabolic responses they are involved in.137 Because of their signalling capacities and the fact that BAs are chemically transformed by the gut microbiota, BAs can therefore be considered as microbiota-derived signalling metabolites. Interestingly, there is a spatio-temporal pattern to be recognised as BAs are released after food intake and then encounter different microbial communities along the intestinal tract. While BSH activity can be carried out by a wide variety of bacteria distributed among many phylogenetically different bacterial divisions, including species able to colonise the small intestine,138 the other reactions are thought to be more restricted to more specialised bacterial species that reside in the distal part of the gut. Therefore, to fully understand the role of the gut microbiota on host metabolism, it is essential to study the involvement of the different bacteria capable of converting BAs. A recent study in centenarians suggested that their specific gut microbiota signatures may partially account for their decreased susceptibility to ageing-associated illnesses, chronic inflammation and infectious diseases by generating unique secondary BAs. This implies that manipulating the BA pool via modulation of the gut microbiota composition could represent a feasible way to combat diseases.139

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is expressed ubiquitously in vertebrate cells and this transcription factor is activated after ligand binding. Numerous AhR ligands exist including environmental triggers, nutrition-derived signals, various phytochemicals and bacterial metabolites such as tryptophan (figure 2). AhR ligand binding results in translocation of the AhR into the nucleus where it is bound to its dimerisation molecule AhR nuclear translocator resulting in the transcription of numerous genes involved in immunity and inflammatory processes (figure 3). Bacterial products and metabolites play a key role as activators and therefore several reports from the past years have tried to figure out the interplay of AhR with the gut microbiota (figures 3 and 4).48 140 Importantly, this AhR pathway has also been linked to energy metabolism and metabolic syndrome as there exists a reduced capacity both in preclinical and clinical settings of metabolising tryptophan into AhR binding derivates in metabolic syndrome.141 These authors showed that an increase of AhR ligands achieved by the administration of a Lactobacillus strain improved metabolic functions paralleled by ameliorated intestinal barrier and reduced hepatic steatosis. Indigo, a naturally occurring AhR ligand with potent anti-inflammatory activities, protects against high-fat diet-induced obesity and metabolic disturbances by upregulation of Lactobacillus spp and the key barrier cytokines interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-22.142 Microbial tryptophan metabolites such as indole-3-ethanol, indole-3-pyruvate and indole-3-aldehyde protect the gut epithelial barrier by affecting the integrity of the apical junctional complex including myosin IIA and ezrin.143 In experimental alcoholic liver disease, a disease where the gut microbiome is substantially impaired,144 induction of AhR ligands and administration of 6-formylindolo (3,2-b) carbazole (Ficz) improved alcoholic liver disease.145 Caspase recruitment domain family member 9−/− mice are more susceptible to colitis and their microbiota fail to metabolise tryptophan to its respective metabolites.146 Transfer of this microbiota into wild-type mice increases colitis and can be improved by treatment with Lactobacillus strains delivering high amounts of AhR ligands. The AhR pathway might have also major implications for other inflammatory GI disorders such as coeliac disease.147 Patients with active coeliac disease show reduced AhR ligand production in their gut compared with non-coeliac control subjects and furthermore in non-obese diabetic mice expressing DQ8 (a transgenic mice that carry only human MHC class II DQ8), a high-tryptophan diet, treatment with Limosilactobacillus reuteri, a bacterial strain producing large amounts of AhR ligands or treatment with the AhR ligand Ficz decreased intestinal pathologies after gluten exposure.147 Germ-free mice show an impaired differentiation and repair of the epidermal barrier and mice lacking AhR in keratinocytes specifically are highly susceptible to cutaneous infections and barrier damage and colonisation with a defined group of bacteria restored the barrier. It remains to be established in this model which role intestinal bacteria might play in a putative gut-skin axis.148 The AhR pathway therefore reflects a prototypic pathway at the interface microbiota-epithelial barrier-metabolism and immune functions.

Most signalling metabolites can be produced by large numbers of different gut bacteria, and hence have limited specificity. However, various bacteria can make specific molecules that have unique interactions with the host (figures 2–4). For obvious reasons, these have been very well characterised in pathogens that can make specific toxins, synthesise polysaccharides to evade the immune system or induce the host to synthesise receptors, allowing them to invade. However, recent research has identified new and unique host signalling molecules that are found in potentially symbiotic gut bacteria. These include immunomodulatory polysaccharides and sphingolipids produced by Bacteroides spp149 150 and muropeptides formed by Enterococcus spp.151

Considering the effectiveness of live and pasteurised A. muciniphila administration in a proof-of-principle human trial,43 118 158 it is not surprising that several proteins from A. muciniphila have recently been identified with potential signalling capacity. A recent one is an 84 kDa protein (encoded by the Amuc_1831 gene) termed P9, which after oral administration was found to induce serum GLP-1 in mice. In vitro studies indicated that P9 interacts with the intercellular adhesion molecule 2 receptor.159 160 Another recently discovered protein identified is the A. muciniphila 50 kDa Amuc_1434* protein that was found to suppress LS174T cell viability via tumour-necrosis-factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis pathway.161 However, both of these proteins are found in many bacteria other than A. muciniphila, both are annotated as proteases suggesting enzymatic activity, and both have not been localised outside the cells, not excluding the possibility that cell lysis is needed for their activity. Even more importantly, their stability has not been addressed, which is of interest as pasteurised A. muciniphila cells were as effective or even more than live cells both in human and mice models.43 162 163 All these arguments do not apply to the other A. muciniphila protein that was discovered to be signalling to TLR2 (figure 4).163 This is the 30 kDa Amuc_1100 protein that has been defined as an outer membrane protein with virtually no homology to other bacteria outside the Verrucomicrobia and in fact is suggested to be a pilus-associated protein.164 Further studies showed Amuc_1100 to be thermostable and preventing diet-induced obesity in a mouse model.163 When comparing all three proteins for their absolute abundance, it is evident that Amuc_1100 is much more abundant than the other two signalling candidates in proteomes of A. muciniphila grown on mucin.165 Hence, future comparative studies should determine which proteins or combinations thereof can explain the observed activity of A. muciniphila in humans.

Besides the classical molecules such as SCFAs, BAs or PAMPs and gut peptides (ie, GLP-1, PYY), all described as regulators of the host metabolism, gut barrier and inflammation, the role of a novel class of molecules called ‘enterosynes’ is emerging. The concept of enterosynes has been recently introduced and defined as ‘molecules originating from the gut which have the capacity to modulate duodenal contraction by targeting the enteric nervous system (ENS). Enterosynes can be chemically diverse and related to hormones, bioactive peptides/lipids, nutrients, microbiota and immune factors’.166

TMAO is related to the intake of quaternary amines, such as betaine, choline and L-carnitine, which are commonly found in vegetables, fruits, meat and seafood and are well-known bacterial osmoprotectants.179 180 Several gut bacteria including several Proteobacteria can convert these quaternary ammonium ions via TMA lyase and its activating enzyme (CutCD) into acetaldehyde and trimethylamine (TMA). TMA then can enter the bloodstream and is converted by flavin monooxygenase in the liver to TMAO. Recent studies have shown that TMAO in serum is strongly associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risks.181 In addition, TMAO has been shown to promote formation of atherosclerotic plaques in a mouse model.182 Moreover, TMAO is a common uraemic toxin.183 Hence, there is considerable interest in understanding the metabolism of these quaternary ammonium ions into compounds that do not lead to TMA or other TMAO precursors. New insight has come from the biochemical and pathway analysis of Eubacterium limosum and its related gut isolate E. maltosivorans that were found to deaminate betaine and other quaternary amines in a novel process involving bacterial cell compartments and leading to the production of acetate and butyrate.184–186 While the latter bacteria are highly related and appear to have a unique vitamin B12-dependent metabolic pathway, this does not hold for the metabolism of histidine that may lead to the production of IMP. It has been shown that concentration of IMP was increased in the serum of patients with T2D.187 It was recently found that IMP is produced from histidine by intestinal bacteria that impaired insulin signalling and glucose tolerance through the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1-dependent pathway.188 Two unrelated bacteria, Streptococcus mutans and Eggerthella lenta have been identified as IMP producers, confirming the fact that many metabolites are produced by several groups of intestinal bacteria that may not share any phylogenetic relations. Altogether, these examples indicate the involvement of intestinal bacteria in generating undesired compounds but identified also new anaerobes that may detoxify these and even convert these in products such as butyrate that have beneficial signalling potential (figures 2 and 3).

Over the last two decades, considerable progress has been achieved. From initial clinical observations to more mechanistic approaches, the field of gut microbiota and health is evolving to irrefutable causal links. However, there are still numerous studies that claim causality when in fact only correlations are being demonstrated. Moving from correlation to causality remains an important and required step to better design putative interventions based on the modulation of the gut microbiota or by using specific active compounds.50 189 Thanks to the numerous efforts and the advance in omics analysis, the scientific community is gradually moving towards personalised medicine and the microbiome era is clearly an important part of the paradigm shift in the future of medicine and nutritional approaches.
