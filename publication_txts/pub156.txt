Traditional Chinese Medicine and Gut Microbiome: Their Respective and Concert Effects on Healthcare

Advances in systems biology, particularly based on the omics approaches, have resulted in a paradigm shift in both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and the gut microbiome research. In line with this paradigm shift, the importance of TCM and gut microbiome in healthcare, as well as their interplay, has become clearer. Firstly, we briefly summarize the current status of three topics in this review: microbiome, TCM, and relationship of TCM and microbiome. Second, we focused on TCM's therapeutic effects and gut microbiome's mediation roles, including the relationships among diet, gut microbiome, and health care. Third, we have summarized some databases and tools to help understand the impact of TCM and gut microbiome on diagnosis and treatment at the molecular level. Finally, we introduce the effects of gut microbiome on TCM and host health, with two case studies, one on the metabolic effect of gut microbiome on TCM, and another on cancer treatment. In summary, we have reviewed the current status of the two components of healthcare: TCM and gut microbiome, as well as their concert effects. It is quite clear that as the holobiont, the maintenance of the health status of human would depend heavily on TCM, gut microbiome, and their combined effects.

With the rapid advancement of research in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and gut microbiome, studies involving both fields have significantly accelerated around the world. TCM and gut microbiome are closely related to human health. Therefore, exploring the relationship between TCM and gut microbiome is essential for healthcare.

The microbiome is a novel research field related to human health, bioenergy, agriculture, and the environment. It has recently emerged as a crucial factor in human physiology and disease. Taking the microbiome into consideration, human beings could be considered “super organisms,” with around 10% human cells and 90% microbial cells, most of which can be found in the gut (Lederberg, 2000). The human gut is a biological niche, home to a variety of microbes that affect nearly all aspects of human biology through their interactions with their hosts (Blaser, 2014). The human intestinal flora is a complex micro-ecosystem, containing approximately 1014 microbes from more than 1,000 microbial species, of which the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria (Gill et al., 2006) account for more than 90% of the species above. In addition, the genetic factors, dietary habits, and various environmental factors of the host lead to the diversity and the specificity of the human intestinal flora, while human intestinal flora in turn would play important roles in exerting host's physiological functions, such as metabolism, energy intake, and immune regulation.

In recent years, with the launching of various international projects on human microecology [e.g., HMP: http://www.hmpdacc.org/, MetaHit: http://www.metahit.eu/ and iHMP (Proctor et al., 2014)], gut microbiome have become the hotspot research between chronic diseases and the gut microbiome has steadily increased, promoting the most significant paradigm shifts in modern medicine.

TCM is in constant development and inheritance along the long Chinese traditional culture. It has been developed in clinics over thousands of years and has accumulated abundant clinical experience, forming a field with unique experiences and specific theories. The TCM system is complex, as it contains components of natural plants, animals, and mineral materials. TCM uses therapeutic herbs to treat the disease and restore the balance of physical function according to the patient's syndrome, based on the combination principle of “King, Vassal, Assistant and Delivery Servant” (Yi and Chang, 2004). Each prescription combination of these herbs is called a TCM preparation or prescription, such as LiuWeiDiHuangWan (LWDHW) pills. Many Chinese herbal medicines are known for their therapeutic effects compared to chemical and biological agents (Chan, 1995; Corson and Crews, 2007; Qiu, 2007), which contain not only bioactive components but also various nutrients such as proteins and polysaccharides. For example, Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., also called “Gan-Cao” in China, as a health-preserving and therapeutic agent, it has been widely utilized for more than 2,000 years. It is one of the most broadly used ingredients in TCM preparations in China, exerting a wide range of pharmacological efficacies. Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. contains many bioactive ingredients, including glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhetinic acid, glycyrol, coumarin, and alkaloids. In addition, previous studies have shown that Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. has a variety of pharmacological effects, including antitumor (Shibata et al., 1991), antiviral (Nakashima et al., 1987), and anti-inflammatory effects (Kimura et al., 1988).

The traditional discovery pathway for most new drugs is to identify or design pharmacologically effective agents that specifically stimulate or inhibit a specific set of target receptors. Nevertheless, the influence of the gut microbiome on humans has been largely ignored in this process. Therefore, the pharmacological effects of these single target drugs on chronic diseases are limited. In contrast, since one of the characteristics of TCM is oral administration, the drug will interact with the intestinal flora inevitably. Previous studies have proven that TCM is conductive to maintain the homeostasis of the intestinal flora (Chang et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016), and the gut microbiome could also exert pharmacological effects of the TCM on host (Park et al., 2006), which render TCM a potential new drug in the western markets. Thus, research about relationship between TCM and gut microbiome is significant, which helps researchers to further study the pharmacological effects of TCM on the human body and the causal links among intestinal microbiome with disease.

In this review, we summarize the current status of microbiome, TCM, relationship of TCM and microbiome, as well as the therapeutic effects of TCM and gut microbiome's mediation roles. Among them, databases and tools that contribute to the molecular understanding of TCM and the role of the gut microbiome in diagnosis and treatment are also presented. Finally, we introduce the impacts of gut microbiome on TCM and host health, with two case studies, one on the metabolic effect of gut microbiome on TCM, and another on cancer treatment (Figure 1).

An increasing number of studies have been conducted on TCM, gut microbiome, and their interplay. Statistics on the published papers in “Public Medicine (PubMed)” (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and “China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI)” (https://www.cnki.net) showed that the number of literature on TCM and gut microbiome continued to rise in recent years (Figure 2). Most importantly, due to the standardization of TCM, research on TCM and gut microbiome has received more and more attention around the world, and the TCM-related research outputs have shown explosive growth in 2019.

To maintain the health of humans under various physiological conditions and environments, TCM and the gut microbiome must coordinate with each other to cope with the challenges. The interactions between TCM and the gut microbiome can mainly be categorized into four types (Figure 3):

The regulatory effects of TCM on gut microbial communities are mainly reflected in treatment of dysbiosis to restore homeostasis of the intestinal flora.

The regulation of TCM on human health can also be reflected in other microbial communities, including saliva and tongue coating (Jiang et al., 2012; Liang et al., 2014; Li, 2015). For instance, through a network pharmacology approach (Li, 2015), the tongue coating microbiome have been found to be associated with various diseases including colorectal cancer (Liang et al., 2014) and “cold-disease” (Jiang et al., 2012). Therefore, the regulation of TCMs can be reflected in microbial communities of various human body habitats, including gut and oral habitats, indicating quite diverse microbial-based approaches for noninvasive probing of human health status.

In recent years, with the widespread use of synthetic and semisynthetic antibiotics, the problem of bacterial resistance has become increasingly serious in clinical fields. Pathogenic bacterial infections are critical factors that may affect the development and severity of the disease. TCM was reported to possess a broad-spectrum antibacterial effect. Therefore, systematic study on the antibacterial activity of TCM and the further development of new drugs have become the focus of more and more researchers.

Currently, more and more research indicate that TCM has antibacterial effect (Table 1).

In the long history of TCM treatment, diet has always been considered as an important category of resources. Development of the research of gut microbiome involves not only the drug and TCM but also the daily diet of humans. Recently, a rapidly increasing number of studies have indicated the crucial role of the diet for the treatment of disease (Leboeuf et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020b; Moayyedi et al., 2020; Naudin et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). In addition, studies about the close relationship between the diet and the intestinal flora have gradually aroused attention, which may offer us some new perspective for disease prevention.

Acetate has been widely distributed in nature, such as in fruits or vegetable oils. A recent study showed that acetate produced by protective Bifidobacteria could improve intestinal defense that is mediated by epithelial cells, and this could protect the host against negative infection (Fukuda et al., 2011). In addition, moderate consumption of wine has shown the potential to delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases: After drinking, microbial metabolites may effectively protect neuroblastoma cells from nitrosative stress injury (Esteban-Fernandez et al., 2017).

With the application of network pharmacology and related databases and tools, the research on TCM and gut microbiome has been further developed (Figure 4).

Furthermore, interactive visualization tools are of equal importance. Cytoscape is an open-source platform that could be used for complex network analysis and visualization (Shannon et al., 2003), which is useful for analyzing the network in network pharmacology studies. Similar functions are also offered by the web services of many databases.

The involvement of the gut microbiome in maintaining the health status of every person will undoubtedly affect the effectiveness of drug treatments, including TCM treatment. Here, we provide two case studies to illustrate this, one on the metabolic effect of gut microbiome on TCM, and the other on cancer treatment, to illustrate the mediation role of the gut microbiome in medicinal treatment in general.

Previous studies have found that many of the chemical constituents of TCM can be transformed and metabolized by the intestinal flora, making it easier for the body to absorb. In other words, the gut is like a processing factory of TCM. The effects of the intestinal flora on different kinds of chemical constituents vary:

Flavonoids represent a major class of secondary metabolites of plants and can be classified into 12 subclasses: anthocyanins, chalcones, dihydrochalcones, flavanols, flavanones, flavones, flavonols, isoflavones, flavan-3-ols, flavan-3,4-diols, aurones, and proanthocyanidins (Crozier et al., 2009). The effects of these polyphenols in the prevention of cancer, cardiovascular disease, T2D, and cognitive dysfunction are supported by an increasing number of studies (Del et al., 2013; Rodriguez-Mateos et al., 2014). To exert their effects, flavonoids are metabolized by the gut microbiome, and the resulting compounds may have bioactivity. Such bacterial conversion and potential health consequences for the human host (Chiou et al., 2014) are hardly unique: Baicalin, puerarin, and daidzin, which are widely found in TCM prescriptions, can also be metabolized by gut microbiome (Kim et al., 1998). As baicalin is difficult to be absorbed in the gut, it has to be hydrolyzed by gut microbiome to baicalein to exert its effect. Metabolism of baicalin was hardly detected in germ-free rats compared to conventional rats, indicating that gut microbiome play a key role in the metabolism of baicalin (Akao et al., 2001).

Saponins can be categorized into steroidal saponins and triterpenoid saponins according to the structure of the aglycone and are widely distributed in nature. Commonly used TCMs, including Panax ginseng C. A. Mey., Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch). Bunge, Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., and Ophiopogon japonicus (Linn. f.) Ker-Gawl. are enriched in saponins. Ginsenosides belong to triterpenoid saponins and are the main active chemical ingredients of Panax ginseng. Currently, pharmacological investigations indicate that ginsengosides have an extensive range of biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antitumor and antidementia effects (Mochizuki et al., 1995; Sun et al., 2008; Shi et al., 2013). Ginsenoside compounds K (CK) is one of the metabolites of ginsengoside, which exerts various pharmacological effects, including antiallergic (Shin and Kim, 2005), antidiabetic (Kim et al., 2014), anticarcinogenic (Zhou et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2013), anti-inflammatory (Joh et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2014), and antiaging effects (Kim et al., 2004). The occurrence of CK in rat plasma is required for intestinal bacterial hydrolysis after oral administration of ginsengosides (Akao et al., 1998). When human intestinal flora was cultured anaerobically with ginsengosides Rb1, Rb2, and Rc, these ginsengosides were metabolized into CK, where the transformation of Rc is conducted by the concert efforts of Bacteroides spp., Eubacterium spp., and Bifidobacterium spp. (Bae et al., 2000; Bae et al., 2002). In addition, intestinal bacterial metabolism of ginsengosides was mainly dependent on the composition of intestinal flora, such as Bacteroides spp., Ruminococcus spp., and Bifidobactetium spp. (Kyung-Ah Kim et al., 2013). Additionally, the metabolism of panax notoginseng saponins (PNSs) was influenced by gut microbiome, of which proteobacteria may have an effect on the deglycosylated metabolism of PNSs by regulating the activities of glycosidases (Xiao et al., 2016). Up-regulation of Bacteroidetes may increase the activity of redox metabolic enzymes in intestinal flora and accelerate the redox metabolism of PNSs (Xiao et al., 2016).

Oxymatrine and matrine are two main alkaloids in the radix Sophorae flavescentis, and Oxymatrine could be transformed into matrine by intestinal bacteria when taken orally, and both can be absorbed by the blood (Wang et al., 2001). Scopolamine was incubated with rat intestinal flora in vitro under limited oxygen conditions, and scopolamine was transformed by gut microbiome into scopine (Chen et al., 2006).

Anthraquinones have widespread applications throughout industry and medicine, and are naturally distributed in many plants, including Rheum officinale Baill., Fallopia multiflora (Thunb.) Harald., Catsia tora Linn., Folium Sennae, and Aloe vera (Linn.) N. L. Burman var. chinensis (Haw.) Berg. Through a chemical constituent study on the metabolism of rhubarb extract by rat intestinal bacteria, a total of 14 components, including emodin-O-glucosides, aloe-emodin-O-glucosides, physcion-O-glucosides, chrysophanol-O-glucosides, and their aglycones were found to be biotransformed by rat intestinal bacteria. Twelve major metabolites were identified in the incubation sample, suggesting the importance of the intestinal flora during the metabolism of anthraquinones (Song et al., 2011).

Carcinogenesis may be mediated by microbiome influencing cellular metabolism, inflammation, and proliferation (Zitvogel et al., 2017). The microbiome regulate cancer at the level of predisposing conditions, initiation, genetic instability, susceptibility to host immune response, progression, comorbidity, and response to therapy. Several examples are as follows:

Moreover, many studies have revealed the crucial role of intestinal flora in colorectal cancer treatment recently (Table 2), indicating the close relationship between gut microbiome and cancer treatment.

In recent years, with the modernization of TCM and the development of systems biology, our understanding of TCM has been significantly advanced. TCM has gradually transformed from an experience-based approach to an evidence-based medicinal system, of which Chinese scientists have made great contributions. We modify this sentence to “For example, it was discovered that arsenic induces the degradation of a key leukemogenic protein and exerts a pharmacological effect on the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (Zhang et al., 2001). Youyou Tu, the Nobel Prize winner, has also focused on TCM research and research on the combination of western medicine and TCM for many years (Tu et al., 1981; Tu et al., 1982). The trend has become clear that more and more TCM researches use molecular biology approach. However, with the systems biology approach enabled, the potential of TCM studies at the molecular level remains to be better exploited.

In summary, researchers might take advantage of TCM and microbiome for better health care and treatment, as both possess the great potential in health care. This might lead to another paradigm shift: from genome-centric precision medicine to systems biology approach enabled holobiont-centric precision medicine.
