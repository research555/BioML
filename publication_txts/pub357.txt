Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion alters metabolic homeostasis by affecting gut signaling and colonic metabolism



Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion (AIMD) has been used frequently to study the role of the gut microbiome in pathological conditions. However, unlike germ-free mice, the effects of AIMD on host metabolism remain incompletely understood. Here we show the effects of AIMD to elucidate its effects on gut homeostasis, luminal signaling, and metabolism. We demonstrate that AIMD, which decreases luminal Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes species, decreases baseline serum glucose levels, reduces glucose surge in a tolerance test, and improves insulin sensitivity without altering adiposity. These changes occur in the setting of decreased luminal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially butyrate, and the secondary bile acid pool, which affects whole-body bile acid metabolism. In mice, AIMD alters cecal gene expression and gut glucagon-like peptide 1 signaling. Extensive tissue remodeling and decreased availability of SCFAs shift colonocyte metabolism toward glucose utilization. We suggest that AIMD alters glucose homeostasis by potentially shifting colonocyte energy utilization from SCFAs to glucose.

Recently, antibiotic-induced microbiome-depleted (AIMD) mice, where luminal bacteria are reduced with the administration of four or more broad-spectrum antibiotics through gavage or drinking water, have been used in conjunction with, or sometimes instead of, germ-free (GF) mice to investigate the role of the gut microbiome in some pathological conditions1–3. The metabolic effects of the absence of microbiota in GF mice have been well characterized—for example, change in the luminal and serum bile acid (BA) pool, increased incretin release, decreased short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) availability, and altered glucose homeostasis4–6. However, the effects of AIMD on the metabolic homeostasis of mice is unknown. Host transcriptomic studies in the gut of GF and AIMD mice show gene expression patterns that are distinct, suggesting that their metabolic physiology may be different7. With a better understanding of the effects of AIMD on host physiology, AIMD mice can be more effectively used in experiments investigating the role of the gut microbiome.

In these studies, we aim to investigate the effects of microbiome depletion on metabolism by performing AIMD in normal-chow fed, wild-type mice to understand its effects on host metabolism. The microbiome of AIMD mice is depleted of all major bacterial phyla except Proteobacteria, as evidenced by negative stool cultures, decrease in stool DNA, and engorgement of the cecum19–23. Our results show that AIMD mice have improved glycemic levels and increased insulin sensitivity despite having the same body weight, food consumption, and body composition. These changes in glucose homeostasis are associated with altered gut hormone release, serum and fecal BA pool, luminal SCFA profile, intestinal gene expression, and intestinal and hepatic glucose and BA metabolic pathways. AIMD reveals the deeply intertwined relationship between the gut, the microbiome, and glucose homeostasis.

Twelve-week-old mice were given twice daily (i.e., every 12 h) oral gavage of ampicillin, vancomycin, neomycin, metronidazole, and amphotericin B (AIMD-treated group) or water (vehicle-treated group)23. Stool cultures prepared from vehicle-treated and AIMD-treated mice revealed far fewer colonies in the AIMD group (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1A). The amount of stool-extracted DNA was nearly 20-fold lower in the AIMD mice compared to vehicle-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 1B), suggesting depletion of all luminal organisms. Finally, AIMD resulted in a massive increase in cecal weight and size (Supplementary Fig. 1C, D), as well as increase in stool output (Supplementary Fig. 1E).

These compositional and diversity changes induced by AIMD have functional implications. We used PICRUSt, a bioinformatics tool designed to predict metagenomic functional content from 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) surveys using known microbial genomes as reference, to assess potential functional differences between the microbiomes of AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated mice26. Many of the predicted functional differences were in metabolic pathways (Supplementary Data 2). The lipid metabolism pathway, including secondary BA biosynthesis, was significantly different between vehicle-treated and AIMD-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 1K). In summary, AIMD in mice consuming a normal-chow diet-induced microbiome depletion, especially of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes species, decreased microbial diversity, and altered the potential functional capabilities of the microbiome.

We then assessed the effects of AIMD on glucose homeostasis. AIMD induced a lower fasting blood glucose level compared to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 2a) after a 4-h fast or a 16-h fast. Glucose clearance was much faster in AIMD mice, with glucose levels lower in the AIMD group compared to the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 2b). The area under the curve (AUC) above baseline for AIMD mice was less than half of that of vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 2c). An insulin tolerance test (ITT) showed that AIMD mice had increased sensitivity to insulin compared to vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 2d). However, fasting insulin levels was not significantly different between AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 2e).

AIMD did not affect the weight of the mice (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 2A). The cumulative food consumption was also indistinguishable between the two groups (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 2B). The body composition of AIMD mice was similar to vehicle-treated mice, with the same amount of fat and lean mass, but there was a change in tissue that could not be characterized as being lean or fat (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 2C, D). This difference is likely due to changes in cecal content. Hence, AIMD resulted in a drop in fasting blood glucose, increased glucose tolerance, and increased insulin sensitivity despite unchanged serum insulin levels in the setting of unchanged mouse body weight, food consumption, and adiposity.

AIMD can affect luminal secondary metabolites and gut signaling, which can affect whole-body glucose homeostasis. AIMD led to a complete disappearance of butyrate from the feces (Fig. 3a). AIMD mice also had a significant decrease in the fecal concentration of propionic acid when compared to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3a). Hence, AIMD changes the SCFA pool, most notably by decreasing butyrate to undetectable levels.

AIMD has substantial effects on the luminal BA pool. Fecal samples from AIMD mice had lower concentrations of many primary BAs (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 1) and secondary BAs (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 1). The ratio of primary to secondary fecal BAs is more than 20-fold higher in AIMD mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Thus, AIMD is accompanied by significant changes in luminal SCFA and BAs. These changes confirm the functional predictions made by the PICRUSt analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1K).

Since changes in luminal secondary metabolites can alter intestinal homeostasis and gut signaling, we assessed gut-released hormones and other metabolically important hormones. First, we measured serum levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), which are incretins that can modulate serum glucose levels. AIMD mice had a nearly 18-fold higher total GLP-1 (Fig. 4a). In addition, blood collection on Ddp4 inhibitor-coated tubes revealed a higher fasted (Fig. 4b) and fed (Fig. 4b) active GLP-1. Although fasting insulin levels were not different, insulin significantly increased after re-feeding AIMD mice (Supplementary Fig. 3A). This suggests that GLP-1 potentiated insulin response after feeding.

We investigated whether the lower fasting blood glucose and the increased glucose clearance seen in GTT were caused by high levels of serum GLP-1. We used a high dose of Exendin-9 (Ex-9), a potent GLP-1 receptor antagonist to reverse the effects of GLP-1 in AIMD mice (Fig. 4i). If GLP-1 is the sole cause of hypoglycemia in AIMD mice, we would expect the GTT response to be similar between vehicle-treated and AIMD mice after Ex-9 injection. Although Ex-9 increased the glycemic surge in AIMD mice, it did not bring their oral glucose tolerate test (oGTT) response to the same level as that of vehicle-treated mice who also received the antagonist (Fig. 4j). In other words, the relative incretin effect of GLP-1 appears to be similar between AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated mice, which suggests that lower blood glucose in AIMD mice is not solely caused by excessive GLP-1.

The effect of AIMD on luminal secondary metabolites and gut signaling suggests that this treatment is also affecting intestinal homeostasis. To further assess the effect of AIMD on the gut, we performed cecal transcriptome analysis. AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated mice cluster by treatment type in a principal component analysis analysis (Fig. 5a). The AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated groups had 6256 differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Fig. 4A and Supplementary Data 3). Ingenuity pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes reveal that they are mainly involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 5b), which is consistent with the decrease in the main fuel of cecal enterocytes, butyrate (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, changes in cellular growth and proliferation, as well as cell death and survival pathways (Fig. 5c), suggest colonic remodeling, which is consistent with the larger cecum size observed in these mice (Supplementary Fig. 1C, D).

AIMD affected gut inflammatory signaling by activating both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cascades. For example, some pro-inflammatory transcripts were significantly higher in AIMD mice (Tlr4, Tnfrs1a; Supplementary Fig. 4B). However, other pro-inflammatory transcripts (e.g., interleukin-18 (IL-18); Supplementary Fig. 4B) were significantly lower in AIMD mice, as was an inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 (IL1rm; Supplementary Fig. 4B). Hence, it is difficult to determine how AIMD affects gut inflammatory pathways through transcriptomics alone. In sum, changes in cecal gene expression suggest that AIMD not only induces gut proliferation and alters inflammatory signaling but also affects cecal enterocyte metabolism.

To better understand the altered glucose homeostasis associated with AIMD, we investigated the expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways. Most strikingly, AIMD leads to extensive reconfiguration of the cecal enterocytes’ metabolism. The decrease in luminal SCFAs, particularly of butyric acid (Fig. 3a) and BAs (Fig. 3b, c), suggests difficulty in the absorption of fatty acids, the primary source of nutrients for enterocytes. Accordingly, compared to vehicle-treated mice, AIMD mice down-regulate genes involved in fatty acid metabolism (Fig. 6a). A schematic of transcriptional changes in the cecum is illustrated in Fig. 6b. There is a downregulation of fatty acid receptors and transporters such as free fatty acid receptor 2 (Ffar2/Gpr41) and fatty acid-binding proteins (e.g., Fabp2). SCFAs are imported into the mitochondria by carnitine palmitoyltransferases (Cpt1a, Cpt2) and processed by acyl-CoA synthetases (Acss1), both of which are downregulated in AIMD mice. Similarly, all the enzymes of fatty acid β-oxidation are downregulated in AIMD mice, including acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (Acadl, Acad8, Acad12), enoyl CoA hydratases (Echdc2), 2,4-dienoyl CoA reductase (Decr1, Decr2), hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (Hadh, Hadhb), and acetyl CoA acyltransferase (Acaa1a, Acaa1b). A parsimonious explanation of the consistent downregulation of β-oxidation genes is that the enterocytes are not using SCFAs for cellular metabolism.

In summary, examination of cecal transcriptomes reveals that proliferative enterocytes shift their metabolic nutritional needs away from SCFAs toward the utilization of glucose. The low amount of luminal SCFAs likely leads to a downregulation of fatty acid uptake, β-oxidation, and lipogenesis. Instead, there is an upregulation of anaerobic glycolysis and downregulation of gluconeogenesis and function of mitochondria. The upregulation of anaerobic glycolysis is similar to a Warburg effect in the setting of upregulated proliferation that correlates with high levels of GLP-1 growth factors. Furthermore, hepatic gene expression suggests that the liver responds to AIMD as though it is in starvation, upregulating the expression of genes in gluconeogenesis, while downregulating glycolysis genes.

Since the luminal BA pool was quite different in AIMD compared to vehicle-treated mice, we examined the cecal enterocytes sequencing results for genes involved in BA processing (Fig. 7a). The expression of the primary transporter for intestinal BA uptake, Slc10a2/Ibat (also known as Asbt), is increased 16-fold in AIMD mice compared to vehicle-treated controls. In addition, organic solute transporter β (Slc51b/Ostb), a subunit of the Ost basolateral transporter complex responsible for exporting BA from enterocytes to the enterohepatic circulation system, is increased 2.5-fold. Both transporters are activated by FXR, and the luminal BA pool contains both FXR agonists (e.g., taurocholic acid (TCA), cholic acid (CA)) and antagonists (e.g., TaMCA, TbMCA). FXR transcription is significantly increased in AIMD mice. In addition, FXR forms an obligate heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXRa) which is also upregulated in AIMD mice. These changes suggest that FXR signaling in the gut is actively increasing the uptake of BAs from the lumen.

In summary, in response to the lower luminal BA concentration, cecal enterocytes in AIMD mice increase the expression of FXR and upregulate BA transporters likely to conserve as much BAs as possible. The transport of primary/conjugated BAs that are FXR antagonists (e.g., TbMCA) into the serum in turn suppresses hepatic FXR targets, such as Shp, which allows Cyp7a1 to upregulate further BA synthesis. Finally, increasing luminal primary BAs by oral gavage with TCA elevates serum GLP-1, suggesting a potential mechanism by which altered luminal BAs in AIMD mice could lead to altered glucose homeostasis.

AIMD induces major changes in luminal secondary metabolites including SCFAs and BAs that in turn affect gut signaling. By depriving the colon of its main fuel source, butyrate, the enterocytes appear to compensate by using glucose to meet their metabolic needs. This affects whole-body glucose homeostasis by lowering serum glucose, improving insulin sensitivity, and increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis. These changes occur in the setting of increased GLP-1 which likely results from increased luminal primary BAs, such as TCA. In addition to glucose utilization by the gut, AIMD causes the gut to selectively upregulate BA absorption. At the whole-body level, there is an increase in serum BAs that are antagonists to FXR, which increases de novo synthesis of primary BAs in hepatocytes.

Although AIMD mice may be preferable to GF mice in some experiments due to their relatively preserved immune function, normal development, and low cost, studies using AIMD should interpret their results cautiously. An acute depletion of the microbiome still has significant metabolic consequences. AIMD perturbs dynamic fluctuations of the gut microbiome driven by diet, genetics, and feeding rhythms, which are important for intestinal homeostasis and host metabolism43,44. Though it is unclear whether the metabolic consequences of AIMD are due to the depletion of the microbiome or administration of antibiotics, or combination thereof, it is likely that they will have a significant impact on other host physiological processes.

The care and use of laboratory animals in our study was approved by the Salk Institute IACUC committee, and we have complied with all relevant ethical regulations. C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories) were housed in barrier facility and were housed 3–4 mice per cage. They were fed a normal-chow diet (LabDiet 5001). After an acclimation period, 12-week-old male mice were pseudorandomized into two groups. This pseudorandomization was based on the initial weight of the mice; in the end, the mean and standard deviation of the weight of the mice was the same between the two groups. One group of mice were given oral gavage of antibiotics (AIMD-treated group) or water (vehicle-treated group) every 12 h. The antibiotic cocktail was comprised of four antibiotics and one antifungal (ampicillin (100 mg/kg, Amresco Inc.), vancomycin (50 mg/kg, Amresco Inc.), metronidazole (100 mg/kg, MP Biomedicals), neomycin (100 mg/kg, Amresco Inc.), amphotericin B (1 mg/kg, Amresco Inc.)). Amphotericin B was added to prevent fungal overgrowth or opportunistic infections. The other group of mice received water. This protocol was maintained for different length of time (30, 19, and 13 days) leading to identical phenotypic results. This cocktail was made fresh every 36 h. Previous studies show that this method of antibiotic administration is the most effective in depleting the microbiome with minimal effects on the morbidity and mortality of the animal23. Experiments with once-daily dosing of all the antibiotics, or using each antibiotic in the cocktail individually did not induce hypoglycemia, or microbiome depletion which replicated previous findings23.

For the TCA gavage experiment, 12-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson laboratories) were given oral gavage of TCA (400 mg/kg, 4 days, Sigma-Aldrich) every 12 h. TCA solution was prepared fresh daily.

To assess microbiome depletion, fresh fecal samples were collected in pre-weighed tubes containing 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and their weights measured. Samples were thoroughly vortexed and diluted with PBS to 1:4. Fecal samples for AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated mice were collected 13 days after gavage initiation. Equal concentrations of stool diluent from AIMD-treated, vehicle-treated, and blanks were placed on LB agar plates and incubated for 7 days. One vehicle-treated sample that contained 1006 colonies was excluded from further analysis since it was an outlier.

Glucose tolerance assays were performed on fasted mice (16 h, paper bedding) by monitoring glucose levels after a glucose bolus (1 g/kg of body weight (BW)) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection or gavage as indicated 2 weeks after gavage initiation. For insulin tolerance, mice were fasted (16 h) and injected IP with insulin (0.5 U/kg BW). Glucose concentration was measured from the tail using a OneTouch Ultra glucometer. For the GLP-1 antagonist study, Ex-9 (250 nmol/kg body weight, Sigma-Aldrich) or 0.9% saline (vehicle control) was injected IP 20 min prior to the glucose bolus.

BW and food consumption were monitored weekly during the acclimation period and every 2–4 days after the start of the antibiotics/vehicle gavage.

Whole-body composition was determined using the EchoMRI-100H analyzer according to the manufacturer’s instruction prior to mice being euthanized (i.e., day 30 for the first cohort and day 19 for the second cohort).

Approximately 2 weeks after gavage initiation, individual animals were placed in clean cages for 24 h. All feces were collected and weighed.

Mice were euthanized with carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by decapitation. Each cecum was carefully dissected out and weight was determined using a precision scale. This experiment was performed in the second cohort (i.e., day 19 after gavage initiation).

Germ-free C57BL/6 mice were bred and maintained in sterile semi-flexible isolators and screened for bacterial, viral, and fungal contamination45. Mice were fed autoclaved chow (LabDiet 5010). Conventionalized brethren in the same facility and diet were used as controls. For serum collection, germ-free mice were fasted for 6 h and blood was collected by cheek bleeding using a sterile lancet. Blood was centrifuged in BD Microtainer® at 6000 rpm for 20 min to isolate the serum.

SCFA concentration in the feces was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry by the AFNS Chromatography Facility at the University of Alberta (http://afns-labs.ualberta.ca/Central-Labs-Chromatography).

BA quantification was performed by the metabolomics core services at the University of Michigan from fecal samples collected from the first cohort of mice (approximately 3 weeks after gavage). BAs were extracted from feces (50 mg) using a two-step solvent extraction. Supernatants were combined, dried, and resuspended for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry separation by reversed phase liquid chromatography. Results were quantified using standard curves of authentic standards. Data were averaged across samples.

Sections (6 μm) of formalin-fixed liver tissue attained from the first cohort of mice (i.e., 30 days after gavage initiation) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

Liver powder obtained from the first cohort of mice (i.e., 30 days after gavage initiation) was homogenized in isopropanol and triglyceride concentration was measured using an enzymatic assay (Triglycerides LiquiColor, Stanbio) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Data are shown normalized to liver weight.

Blood was collected from fasted (4–16 h) or re-fed animals (15 min to 1 h). Re-feeding was performed by injecting a bolus of glucose (1 g/kg of BW) IP or by oral gavage as indicated. For active GLP-1 measurement, blood was collected on Dpp4 inhibitor-coated tubes (BD P700). Serum glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels were assessed using Infinity reagents (Thermo Scientific) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Serum endocrine panel (ghrelin, GIP, GLP-1, glucagon, insulin, leptin) was performed using the Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Diabetes 8-Plex Assay (Bio-Rad) as per the manufacturer’s protocol.

Ceca were collected from the first cohort of mice (i.e., 30 days after gavage initiation), emptied of their content, and flash-frozen. Libraries were prepped using Illumina’s TruSeq Stranded mRNA HT Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, total 1 µg RNA was poly-A selected, fragmented by metal-ion hydrolysis and then converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using SuperScript II. The cDNA was then end-repaired, adenylated, and ligated with Illumina sequencing adapters. Finally, the libraries were enriched by PCR amplification. Libraries were pulled into groups of 12 to a lane and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 50-bp single-read chemistry.

Principal component analysis was performed using the 500 genes with highest variance across all samples. A heatmap was generated by selecting differentially expressed genes associated with sugar or lipid metabolism. A regularized logarithm transformation48 was applied to the gene-level read counts, which were then mean-centered and hierarchically clustered for visualization.

RNA and cDNA were prepared andqRT-PCR performed49. Absolute transcript expression was calculated using the standard curve method (using three technical replicates), normalized to 18S RNA, actin and RPL10 expression, and finally median normalized group wise (n = 8/group).

Fecal samples from the same time point were collected from individually housed mice the day before gavage treatment initiation. Likewise, before the end of the experiment fecal samples were collected from individually housed AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated mice. Stool were frozen until DNA collection. The stool pellets were then weighed and resuspended in PBS and DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen), precipitated, and washed with ethanol. Resulting DNA was resuspended in TE. 16S rRNA gene sequence tags, corresponding to the hypervariable V3–V4 region, were generated using the MiSeq sequencing platform. The full-length primer sequences are50: 16S amplicon PCR forward primer = 5′-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG; 16S amplicon PCR reverse primer = 5′-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC.

The 9,584,677 total raw reads from Illumina MiSeq were quality controlled using QIIME v1.9.1 with default parameters, followed by closed-reference OTU clustering at 97% similarity level against the GreenGenes database (v13_8), resulting 4,344,060 reads in total (average of 164,103 for NA, 164,989 for aNA, and 296,188 for pre-treatment). After rarefying the samples to the same sequencing depth of 20,000 reads per sample, α-diversity, β-diversity, and differential OTU abundance analyses were performed on the rarefied OTU table with QIIME and ANCOM.

The functional profile of KEGG Orthology (KO) for each sample was predicted from 16S rRNA amplicon data with PICRUSt. The predicted KO abundances were collapsed to level 3 by grouping them into a higher level of functional categorization.

Most experiments had an n of 6–8 mice per group. Our previous experience has shown that this number is sufficient to notice a 20% change between groups43,49,51. AIMD-treated and vehicle-treated mice (two groups) comparisons were done with unpaired t tests (serum measurements) or Mann–Whitney U test (SCFA or BA measurements). Three-way comparisons (pre-treatment vs. AIMD vs. vehicle) were done with Kruskal–Wallis test. To address the compositionality problem inherent in sequencing data sets (i.e., 16S microbiome differences), we performed ANCOM analysis24 to statistically test the differential abundance between pre-treatment/vehicle group and AMID group. Statistical significance of differential gene expression from RNA-sequencing data was assessed using a negative binomial Wald test, and then corrected for multiple hypothesis testing with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. No blinding was performed for these experiments.
