Links between Nutrition, Infectious Diseases, and Microbiota: Emerging Technologies and Opportunities for Human-Focused Research

The interaction between nutrition and human infectious diseases has always been recognized. With the emergence of molecular tools and post-genomics, high-resolution sequencing technologies, the gut microbiota has been emerging as a key moderator in the complex interplay between nutrients, human body, and infections. Much of the host–microbial and nutrition research is currently based on animals or simplistic in vitro models. Although traditional in vivo and in vitro models have helped to develop mechanistic hypotheses and assess the causality of the host–microbiota interactions, they often fail to faithfully recapitulate the complexity of the human nutrient–microbiome axis in gastrointestinal homeostasis and infections. Over the last decade, remarkable progress in tissue engineering, stem cell biology, microfluidics, sequencing technologies, and computing power has taken place, which has produced a new generation of human-focused, relevant, and predictive tools. These tools, which include patient-derived organoids, organs-on-a-chip, computational analyses, and models, together with multi-omics readouts, represent novel and exciting equipment to advance the research into microbiota, infectious diseases, and nutrition from a human-biology-based perspective. After considering some limitations of the conventional in vivo and in vitro approaches, in this review, we present the main novel available and emerging tools that are suitable for designing human-oriented research.

The interaction between nutrition and infectious diseases has always been recognized. Before the era of antibiotics, diet was considered an essential part of the management of infections. Malnutrition, including undernutrition and overnutrition, can increase susceptibility to infectious diseases and amplify the severity of an infection, which in turn, can worsen malnutrition [1]. Thanks to the advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, the gut microbiota has been emerging as an integral mediator in the complex relations between food, the human body, and infectious diseases. The complex community of microorganisms inhabiting an animal’s or human’s digestive tract constitutes the gut microbiota and their collective genetic content constitutes the gut microbiome. High-throughput comparative metagenomics and meta-transcriptomics enabled by the development of NGS platforms have led to an unprecedented understanding of human, animal, and environmental microbiomes, and have shown that the gut microbiota is comparable to a virtual organ or emergent system, whose properties need to be integrated into host biology and physiology [2].

In the last few years, there have been large steps forward in microfluidics, tissue engineering, computing power, artificial intelligence, etc., which have brought about an amazing array of tools and research approaches that are offering bold new ways to study the human gut microbiome regarding pathogens and the effect of nutrition in a human-biology-based setting. In addition, the field of metagenomics and other “omics” disciplines has greatly expanded due to improvement in sequencing technologies, namely “third-generation sequencing,” as well as analytical and single-cell techniques, allowing for a more comprehensive characterization of microbial communities and host–microbe interactions. These tools and approaches could potentially yield profuse and meaningful human-relevant data, allowing for a better understanding of human pathophysiology, while helping to reduce the number of animals employed in biomedical research, eventually replacing them. After discussing some of the major limitations associated with traditional in vivo and in vitro models, in this review, we present a list of the novel available and emerging tools and approaches used to study the interactions between the human host and the gut microbiome and pathogens through a more holistic representation of the human in vivo microenvironment. The potential opportunities regarding modifying and shaping the microbiota through nutritional interventions to treat or prevent infectious diseases will be also considered.

Animal models, including mice, fish, and insects, have been extensively used to analyze host–microbiome interactions and their contributions to pathophysiology in infectious diseases regarding diet. Mice are the model of choice for most studies in this emerging field, allowing for manipulations in the gut microbiota and host to be studied in a controlled experimental setup [32]. Manipulations include host genetic background manipulation (gene knockouts); gut microbiota composition manipulation (controlled inoculation in germ-free or gnotobiotic mice, i.e., germ-free mice administered with human microbes); and ecosystem interventions, including dietary interventions, antibiotic treatment, and fecal transplantations.

The high number of therapeutic compounds that fail to translate in clinical trials [37,77,78], coupled with increasing awareness of the ethical and scientific issues surrounding the use of animal models [38,39,79,80], highlights the need and importance for models that are more physiologically relevant to the human body to personalize treatments and better predict patient outcomes.

Advances in stem cell technology, microengineering, microfluidics, high-throughput third-generation sequencing techniques, computing power, machine learning (ML), and respective multidisciplinary cooperation has allowed for the development of new technologies and approaches, which were inaccessible until a few years ago. These technologies are beginning to provide more clinically relevant data and hold immense promise for studying complex regulatory networks and crosstalk between the host, gut microbiota, pathogens, and diet in a human-focused and physiologically-relevant setting. They comprise i) human-based multi-omics approaches, including (meta)genomics, (meta)transcriptomics, (meta)proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics, which result from global analyses of biological samples by high-throughput analytical approaches and databases; ii) computational models; iii) patient-derived cells, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their differentiated derivatives, such as organoids; and iv) tissue engineering and advanced in vitro technologies (e.g., organs- or organoids-on-a-chip and microphysiological systems).

Omics disciplines include genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, which refer to the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome, respectively, of a species, population, or community. “Omics” aims at the collective characterization and quantification of pools of biological molecules that translate into the structure, function, and dynamics of an organism or population. The start of the 21st century was characterized by rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing, high-content- and single-cell technologies, mass spectrometry (MS), bioinformatics, and computational power. NGS techniques, also known as “second-generation sequencing,” which are capable of reading the code of millions of small fragments of DNA in parallel, enabled faster sequencing with increased throughput at falling costs, which allow for the assessment of genes and genomes contained within complex microbial communities. These techniques have entirely changed the perception of the human microbiome and have paved the way for the establishment of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics.

As computational models are fairly reliant on the data they are trained on or are called upon to analyze, no model, regardless of its sophistication, can generate a useful analysis from low-quality data. Since the results returned by computational models are based exclusively on the input data and represent existing knowledge, these models are valid within the same context of that knowledge and their performance will be reduced if they are not regularly updated using novel, emerging, human-relevant data. Likewise, the development and adaptation of integrated software platforms are central to the efficient and effective use of data and for predictive computational modeling [141].

Organoids are stem-cell-derived and self-organized 3D clusters of organ-specific cells that incorporate many of the physiologically relevant features of the in vivo tissue, including the functionality, as well as molecular and cellular heterogeneity, of the originating organ [142]. Human organoids are suitable models for studying the mechanisms of morphogenesis and are promising platforms for disease modeling and drug screening [143]. Over the past decade, researchers have developed protocols to differentiate human stem cells into multiple lineages, obtaining several organoids, including (but not limited to) pancreas [144], liver [145], stomach [146], and intestine [147].

Although there is still significant room to improve regarding modeling the true physiology of intestinal function, hiOs have already enabled new avenues of research into host–microbial interaction and are promising tools to study the nutrients–gut microbiota–infections triangle.

Organs-on-a-chip (OoCs) are microfluidic cell culture devices in which (human) cells are cultured in engineered microenvironments that imitate the essential aspects of multicellular architectures, dynamic, tissue-tissue interfaces, physicochemical microenvironments, flow, and gradients found in the human body [197]. A wide range of tissues and organs have been modeled, including heart [198], kidney [199], brain [200], liver [201], blood vessels [202], lymphoid follicle [203], and intestine [204]. For this review, we discuss the use of OoCs to study intestinal dynamics with a specific focus on the gut microbiome and infectious diseases. OoCs models of the human intestine have been developed and successfully employed to study intestinal physiology and pathophysiology. Over the past few years, human intestine-on-a-chip models have been engineered with increasing complexity that also include neighboring channels lined by human microvascular endothelium, commensal microbiota, pathogenic bacteria, immune cells, and some even allow for the application of cyclic mechanical forces that mimic peristalsis-like deformations experienced by the intestine in vivo [205]. Peristalsis-like mechanical forces induce epithelial cells to spontaneously form polarized 3D villus-like structures that contain all the specialized differentiated intestinal epithelial cells (including adsorptive enterocytes, mucus-producing goblet, Paneth, and enteroendocrine cells) [195,206,207,208]. The resulting epithelial layer shows the basic functional properties, such as mucus production, high barrier resistance, activity of the brush border, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and high efficiency in nutrient uptake. These features allow for studies focusing on nutrient uptake and digestion, barrier function, and drug metabolism [195,206,207,208,209], as well as for co-cultures with human commensal bacteria for extended periods (up to weeks) [206,210]. Human intestine-on-a-chip or human gut-on-a-chip (hGoC) have already been used to model invasion or infection by pathogenic entero-invasive E. coli strains into the commensal bacterial biofilm or the host intestinal endothelium [210,211], as well as to model Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium infections [212,213]. Grassart et al. [214] have successfully modeled the impact of flow and peristalsis on the human pathogen Shigella within a 3D colonic epithelium using hGoC technology. The authors observed that Shigella invasion accurately imitates what has been previously reported from clinical data. Shigella was also shown to leverage the intestinal microenvironment by taking advantage of the microarchitecture and mechanical forces to efficiently invade the intestine. This study is the proof-of-concept that we can use hGoCs to gain insights into infection mechanisms of human-restricted pathogens and that such models could provide a viable alternative to animals, particularly where species differences can preclude accurate extrapolation to humans. In addition, some lactic acid bacteria have been used to model the presence or biochemical contribution of probiotics in human microbiota using hGoC models [206,212,215]. Notably, it has been shown that the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG improved intestinal barrier function when co-cultured in the lumen of the intestinal epithelial channel of the hGoC [206], and that the VSL#3® probiotic formulation suppressed villus blunting and the loss of barrier function induced by infection with pathogenic E. coli in this model [210]. Thus, the hGoC approach may also be useful for the discovery of new microbiome-based therapeutics, such as genetically engineered commensal bacteria [216]. Furthermore, by integrating circulating and organ-specific human immune cells into hGoCs, they might be useful for the in vitro development of new mucosal vaccines [217]. Villenave et al. [218] demonstrated that human Enterovirus infection, replication, and infectious virus production can be analyzed in vitro in a hGoC microfluidic device. Since the analysis of Enterovirus infection is difficult in animals because they express different virus receptors than humans, hGoCs may provide suitable in vitro models for enteric virus infection and for investigating the mechanisms of enteroviruses’ pathogenesis.

Integrating gut–liver organ-on-a-chip systems with pathobionts/pathogens and immune cells might allow for future study into the interaction between microbiota, pathogens, and the effect of nutrients in a more complex multi-organ context.

While traditional animal and cell culture models of gut microbiota and infectious diseases have been useful for elucidating some of the mechanisms underlying microbiota and nutrition relationships, the use of non-human (animal) models to mimic the complex interplay between host–microbiota–pathogens and the effects of nutritional pro- and prebiotic interventions may potentially be misleading in light of the numerous interspecies differences. In addition, although some problems of external validity can be overcome by improving the animal models, the problem of species differences can never be overcome and will always undermine external validity and the reliable translation of preclinical findings to humans, emphasizing the need to focus on human-relevant research methods and technologies [37,228]

The feasibility of the envisioned human-based strategy necessarily requires the establishment of an integrated, collaborative strategy to investigate the relationship between nutrition, microbiota, and infectious diseases at multiple levels of complexity (from gene expression to protein, cells, and tissues/organs at the individual and population levels) (Figure 3).

Advanced human-relevant 3D cellular models, high-throughput (“omics” and meta-omics) readouts, and computational models, together with data obtained from the meta-analysis of epidemiological and interventional studies, are among the ideal tools used to investigate the complex relations between nutrition, microbiota, and infectious diseases in a human-biology-based milieu, as well as to develop new microbiome-related therapeutics or to implement personalized nutritional interventions.

Although most of the methodologies and approaches described in this review are still in their infancy, they are already yielding meaningful human-relevant data. In our opinion, the development and application of these approaches should be encouraged, while funding for research focusing on human-centered models, rather than “improved” animal models, should be prioritized.
