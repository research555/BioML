‘Gut health’ and the microbiome in the popular press: a content analysis



Extensive research and important discoveries on the microbiome have led to a growth in media coverage. This study explores how the microbiome has been portrayed in press sources popular among American and Canadian audiences.

Content analysis.

Using the FACTIVA Database, we compiled a finalised data set of (N=830) articles from press sources popular among American and Canadian audiences which were published between 1 January 2018 and 11 October 2019 and which contained at least one of the following search terms: ‘microbiome’, ‘microbiota’, ‘gut health’, ‘healthy gut’, ‘unhealthy gut’, ‘gut bacteria’, ‘probiotic’ or ‘probiotics.’ We performed content analysis on the articles to determine how often ideas of the microbiome were presented as beneficial, in which health contexts, and whether actions could be taken to reap stated benefits. We compared this portrayal of benefits with critical portrayals of the microbiome.

Almost all of the articles (94%) described health benefits associated with the microbiome with many (79%) describing actions which could be taken to reap stated benefits. Articles most often described health benefits in more broad, general context (34%) and most commonly outlined actions related to food/drug (45%) as well as probiotic (27%) intake. Only some articles (19%) provided microbiome-related critiques or limitations. Some of the articles (22%) were focused on highlighting specific research developments, and in these articles, critiques or limitations were more common.

Articles discussing the microbiome published for American and Canadian audiences typically hype the microbiome’s impact and popularise gut health trends while only offering a little in the way of communicating microbiome science. Lifestyle choices including nutrition, taking probiotics, stress management and exercise are often promoted as means of reaping the microbiome-related health benefits. The trend of actionable ‘gut health’ is foregrounded over more evidence-based descriptions of microbiome science.

The term microbiome (derived from the Greek for ‘small life’) encompasses the microbial community that lives in and on our bodies, as well as the genes these microorganisms express and their metabolic activity. Over the past decade, technological advances in genetic sequencing have greatly accelerated our understanding of the human microbiome in health and disease. Fuelled by extensive research, important discoveries about the microbiome have steadily increased resulting in a growth in coverage by the popular media.1–6 Researchers have been examining the roles that diverse microorganisms play in shaping our environments and impacting our health.7 8 This includes exploration of how the microbiome may influence, for example, risk of obesity,9 cancer10 mental health outcomes,11 12 and cardiometabolic and chronic disorders.13 Other research has been investigating the microbiome’s role in childhood asthma14–16 as well as the how the use of antibiotics alters gut microbiota.16–18 Currently, however, there are only a few microbiome-related interventions in use,19 20 and critiques have been made around the hyping21 of gut microbiome’s potential impact in various contexts.1 4 22–27 In particular, while research has indicated benefits for the use of probiotics in the context of paediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhoea,28 critiques have also been raised about the exaggerated benefits attributed to probiotics.29–31

This project analysed portrayals of the microbiome in popular English-language news sources for American and Canadian audiences. We mapped out how often, and for which health topics and conditions, microbiome ideas were portrayed as beneficial. We then determined how often, and which actions were presented in order to obtain stated benefits. Lastly, we examined how often ideas of the microbiome were presented critically—that is, whether microbiome benefits or actions were presented as unproven, uncertain, ineffective or exaggerated.

To examine how the microbiome was portrayed in the popular press, we performed directed content analysis36 on articles published in newspaper sources popular among English-speaking American and Canadian audiences.37 We used the FACTIVA Database to search for and download all articles published on a popular source list between 1 January 2018 and 11 October 2019 (the day of data collection), which contained at least one of the following search terms: ‘microbiome’, ‘microbiota’, ‘gut health’, ‘healthy gut’, ‘unhealthy gut’, ‘gut bacteria’, ‘probiotic’ or ‘probiotics.’ The search terms were chosen to capture microbiome-related media content created for general audiences without excluding the presence of more specific, research-focused content. The terms were finalised after various reviews of sample searches were performed. The time frame was selected as it was observed through FACTIVA searches and analysis on Google trends that the topics of ‘microbiome’ and ‘gut health’ had been steadily and increasingly receiving media attention from 2010 onwards with no apparent deviations. See online supplemental material 1 for search summary and list of sources including article counts.

During coding, articles that were coded as irrelevant were removed, and the finalised total data set resulted in (N=830) articles. Articles were deemed irrelevant if they were duplicates, incomplete (eg, a ‘gut health’ headline embedded in an unrelated article), television show transcripts, or focused exclusively on animal biology or business developments. All articles were coded by two coders who met periodically to discuss any irregularities and reach consensus on disagreements. This process, as outlined and enacted in other research projects,36 40 41 entailed coders being instructed to flag any articles which posed coding ambiguities, and on each meeting collaboratively coding these uncertainties through discussion and consensus. Once all articles had been coded, each coder performed an audit on a sample of articles coded by the other coder to ensure no significant issues were present.

This research was done without patient or public involvement. Patients or members of the public were not invited to comment on the study design and were not consulted to interpret the results. Patients or members of the public were not invited to contribute to the writing or editing of this document for readability or accuracy. Funders had no input on the decision to publish nor the content.

The 830 articles were published in a total of 41 sources of which 143 (17.2%) came from 18 Canadian sources, 244 (29.4%) came from 18 American sources, and 443 (53.4%) came from the 5 sources based in the UK. Of the 830 articles, 439 (52.9%) were published in 2018, and 391 (47.1%) were published in 2019 (before 11 October). In describing the findings, we will use the term ‘microbiome’ as an all-encompassing term for all associated rhetoric.

*Excluding additional 47 articles where probiotics were portrayed as beneficial without mentioning gut health ideas.

There were a few notable distinctions between the articles primarily focused on specific research (n=180, 21.7%) and the remaining articles which did not (n=650, 78.3%). First, as previously mentioned, articles discussing the microbiome in the context of babies/children constituted 25.6% of articles focused on research, but were present in only 8.3% of other articles not specifically focused on research. Both research-focused articles and more general articles described health benefits in relation to the microbiome with similar frequency (90.6% and 87.5%, respectively), and non-research-specific articles detailed microbiome-related actions (80.9%) only slightly more often than research-focused articles (70.6%). Research-specific articles, however, discussed critical perspectives of the microbiome (30.0%) approximately twice as often as general articles (15.7%).

The findings from this research demonstrate the presence of microbiome hype3 25 30 in the popular press of American and Canadian audiences. The overwhelming majority of articles (93.8%) either describe health benefits associated with the microbiome or list health benefits associated with taking probiotics. When detailing health benefits, the vast majority of these articles (89.2%) list actions that can be taken to obtain these claimed benefits. As there is demonstrable public interest in the relationship of the microbiome to one’s health, and with considerable interesting research underway, it is unsurprising that numerous health benefits are detailed in articles. Still, a weakness in the way this science is being communicated is the fact that less than 19% of the articles suggest that current microbiome science or applications are unproven, ineffective, exaggerated or requiring more research. This occurs with even less frequency in general articles where the central focus is not detailing specific research. And, as noted in the introduction, despite the abundance of promising research, there are still few microbiome-related clinical applications ready for use.

Further, in cases where a critique was evident, nearly half (46.8%) portrayed limitations to the microbiome as being simply a case of preliminary research, which may or may not influence how the diverse readership of the popular press interprets the realistic state of the scientific developments.50–54 Specifically, it may give a false impression of a potential application’s readiness, for example, in cases of the microbiome’s influence on autism or mental health.4 The hyping of science, however, typically involves numerous participants21 48 and it is therefore misguided to isolate singular actors as the propagators of information distortion such as the authors of the articles in the popular press. Indeed, extensive research has shown how information dissemination through social media creates an abundance of information accuracy challenges.55–58

This study was limited in its ability to capture and analyse all of the microbiome discourses relevant to audiences. Covering the popular press’s portrayal of the microbiome during a period when the topic was popular has provided insights into how microbiome science is being communicated. Future research could replicate this study in other regions to see whether the same trend persists or whether some press sources, in some contexts, portray the microbiome in significantly different manners. Additionally, other research projects could explore whether these portrayals are similar or different on popular social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter or TikTok.

Microbiome articles published for North American audiences typically popularise gut health trends while only offering a little in the way of communicating the science. It is promising to see cases where some complexities of the research were presented alongside ongoing applications, but the overall number of articles which did this were few. The ongoing communication of accurate science will require a more concerted effort from all of those involved in the process.
