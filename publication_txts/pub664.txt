Altered gut microbiome and autism like behavior are associated with parental high salt diet in male mice

Neurodevelopmental disorders are conditions caused by the abnormal development of the central nervous system. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is currently the most common form of such disorders, affecting 1% of the population worldwide. Despite its prevalence, the mechanisms underlying ASD are not fully known. Recent studies have suggested that the maternal gut microbiome can have profound effects on neurodevelopment. Considering that the gut microbial composition is modulated by diet, we tested the hypothesis that ASD-like behavior could be linked to maternal diet and its associated gut dysbiosis. Therefore, we used a mouse model of parental high salt diet (HSD), and specifically evaluated social and exploratory behaviors in their control-fed offspring. Using 16S genome sequencing of fecal samples, we first show that (1) as expected, HSD changed the maternal gut microbiome, and (2) this altered gut microbiome was shared with the offspring. More importantly, behavioral analysis of the offspring showed hyperactivity, increased repetitive behaviors, and impaired sociability in adult male mice from HSD-fed parents. Taken together, our data suggests that parental HSD consumption is strongly associated with offspring ASD-like behavioral abnormalities via changes in gut microbiome.

According to statistics of the World Health Organization, approximately 1% of the world population is currently diagnosed with ASD, the most common neurodevelopmental disorder1,2. Yet, its etiology is not fully understood. The current consensus is that ASD is likely caused by the combination of genetic, environmental, and neurodevelopmental factors3.

Dietary habits are amongst the most important factors shaping the gut microbiome15,16. A diet rich in salt (i.e. high salt diet, or HSD) for instance, can result in depletion of the gut bacteria Lactobacillus spp.17, which results in T helper cell-mediated immune dysregulation17,18, and cognitive dysfunction19–21. Increased salt intake is a worldwide well-established cause of morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension, cardiovascular diseases as well as kidney failure22. However, HSD has not been fully addressed in the context of gut microbiome-mediated prenatal effects on offspring neurodevelopment. Therefore, we report that 8-week chronic consumption of HSD alters the parental gut microbiome composition. Specifically, we found that HSD was associated with depletion of Lactobacillus spp. and enrichment of Akkermansia in mice fecal samples. We also observed that this altered gut microbiome is transferred to the offspring, which shared the same gut microbial composition with their parents until (at least) their weaning age. Finally, we found that this “inherited” modified gut microbiome is associated with abnormal social behaviors and hyperactivity in adult male mice only, not in females. Together, our results support the notion that ASD-like behaviors can be linked to parental HSD-induced gut dysbiosis.

Male and female wild-type C57Bl/6 mice (3–4 weeks‐old) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, US), and housed at Texas Tech University’ animal facility. Mice were group housed (4–5 same-sex mice/cage) in ventilated cages in a temperature‐controlled room (21–23 °C) with 12:12 h light/dark light cycle (lights on 07:00–19:00), humidity of 40–60%, and food and water available ad libitum. All experiments and procedures were performed observing the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines and following relevant guidelines and regulations approved by the Texas Tech University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Mice were randomly assigned to control or HSD groups and were fed chow supplemented with 0.1% NaCl (Control, Teklad Custom Diet TD-94268) or 8% NaCl (HSD, Teklad Custom Diet TD-180241) respectively for 8 weeks. Both diets contained ~ 23% calories from protein, 62% from carbohydrate and ~ 15% from fat. The HSD groups were also given 1% NaCl in their drinking water whereas the control groups drank regular tap water. After 8 weeks male and female mice were used for behavioral assays while others were paired for breeding. All the experiments were performed in a separate room adjacent to the room where mice were housed.

The open field test was done using a large plastic container measuring 12in width × 18in length × 12in height. Individual mice were placed inside and allowed to freely explore the arena for 5 min. The session was videotaped and then analyzed using Ethovision XT tracking system, which was used to analyze all behavioral tests (Noldus, Leesburg, VA). Several parameters were quantified: Total distance traveled, speed of movement and time spent in the center versus periphery regions. Additionally, the number of rearing events and cumulative grooming time were measured. This test was done on both parents and offspring.

The EPM test was performed using a four-arm plus shaped maze elevated 30 inches from the ground, with two arms with walls and two arms open. The arm length was ~ 20 inches with a 4-inch center square between all four arms. Individual mice were placed in the center part and then were allowed to freely explore for 5 min while the session was videotaped. The time the mouse spent in the closed arms versus the open arms was quantified for detecting avoidance behavior23.

The NOR test was performed in the same plastic container used for OFT. The test consisted of two consecutive sessions, a first session used for familiarization and a second session used as a test for memory acquisition. In the familiarization session, two identical objects were placed in the bottom of the container, equidistant from each other and the side walls. Then a single mouse was placed in the arena and allowed to freely explore for 5 min. After this session, the mouse was returned to its home cage. For the test session one of the identical objects was replaced with a novel unfamiliar one. The test session was performed in two phases. For evaluating short term memory, the mouse was placed inside the container 1 h after familiarization. For long term memory, the mouse was placed inside the container 24 h after the familiarization session. In both phases, each mouse was allowed to explore the objects for 5 min while the session was videotaped. The time each mouse spent exploring the familiar and novel objects was quantified and a preference index was calculated using the following equation PI = [time spent exploring novel object/(time exploring familiar object + time exploring novel object)] × 100%24.

The T-maze test was performed using a T shaped maze, 30 inches elevated from the ground. The total length of the top arm was 44 inches and the bottom arm was 20 inches. All arms had walls. For the test, a single mouse was placed in the outermost corner of the bottom arm and was allowed to explore the whole maze for 5 min while videotaping the session. Working memory was evaluated by quantifying the number of spontaneous alternations between entering the three different arms25.

The 3-chamber sociability test was done in the offspring generation to evaluate possible sociability deficits26. The test was done in a plastic container (15in × 19in × 10in) divided in three separate chambers by two inner partitions which had a single small opening to allow mice to move between chambers. The experiment was performed in two consecutive sessions, the first for training and the second for testing. In the training session, a small metal mesh box was placed in both the left and right chambers. An individual subject mouse was placed in the middle chamber and was allowed to explore the entire container for 5 min, then removed and kept in an empty cage while the container was prepared for the following session (test). For the testing session, an unfamiliar mouse (i.e. not a cage mate) of the same sex was placed inside one of the metal mesh boxes and kept there as “social (S) chamber”. The mesh box in the other lateral chamber was kept empty and was referred to as a “non-social (NonS) chamber”. The subject mouse was then placed back in the middle chamber and allowed to explore for 5 min while videotaping. We then quantified the total time that the subject mouse spent interacting with the metal wire container in either the S or NonS chambers. Interaction was defined as sniffing and/or touching the metal wire container while actively exploring it.

The marble burying test was used to evaluate repetitive behaviors in the offspring27. For the test we used a clean, empty mouse cage and filled it with to 2 inches of regular bedding material. On top of this layer of bedding, 40 small black marbles were placed in a grid-like organized pattern and a photograph was taken. An individual mouse was placed inside the cage and was allowed to explore for 15 min. After the exploration period, the mouse was returned to its home cage and a second photograph was taken. The number of buried and unburied marbles was quantified by two experimenters blind to the mouse treatment, by comparing the before and after photographs. We considered a single marble as buried if at least 75% of its shape was clearly covered by bedding material27.

The urinary pheromone test was performed in the same container used for the OFT. We first collected urine from mice unfamiliar to the experimental groups (i.e. not cage mates) and kept it frozen. Right before the experiment, an aliquot of urine was thawed, a cotton swab was soaked in it and placed at the bottom of the container. Then a single mouse was placed inside and was allowed to explore for 5 min while videotaping the session. We measured the time directly interacting with the swab28.

Colonic fecal samples were collected from the dams of both diet groups before weaning. The fecal samples from the offspring groups were collected before weaning at 2–3 weeks of age (i.e. while they were still housed with their mothers). To reduce stress, mice were placed inside autoclaved plastic boxes where they freely defecated. Feces were then collected and placed in autoclaved cryotubes, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and immediately stored at − 80 °C. DNA extraction from the samples, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of the variable 4 (V4) region of the 16s rRNA gene and sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform were performed by the Molecular Research LP laboratories (MR DNA, Shallowater, TX, USA).

The data obtained from sequencing was processed using the MR DNA data processing pipeline (MR DNA, Shallowater, TX, USA). Sequences shorter than 150 bp, sequences with ambiguous base call and sequences depleted of barcodes and primers were removed. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined by clustering at 97% similarity followed by the removal of chimeras. OTUs were taxonomically classified using BLASTn against a curated database derived from RDPII and NCBI. All samples were run concurrently by blinded experimenters. Raw data have been deposited under the umbrella BioProject: PRJNA713927. Data are publicly accessible at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA713927.

After weaning, female mice from the parental generation were anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by decapitation. Trunk blood samples were rapidly collected in autoclaved tubes, and the serum was separated by centrifugation (3000 rpm for 30 min). Proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-10, IL-17, IL-23, and TNF-α were detected using a LEGENDplex Mouse Inflammation Panel (Biolegend, CA, USA).

All behavioral analysis was done using Ethovision XT software (Noldus, Leesburg, VA). Data analysis and statistical analysis was done using Origin 2017 software (OriginLab Corporation). For determining statistical differences between two groups, paired and unpaired Student’s t-test was used. Whereas difference between multiple groups was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test. Differences between groups were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.

To monitor growth during HSD, we weighed mice weekly. Figure 1a shows that over time, HSD-fed male mice gained significantly less weight than controls, while females did not show any significant difference. On average, control male mice weighed 25.07 ± 0.63 g after 8 weeks of HSD, while HSD-fed male mice weighed 22.56 ± 0.29 g (Fig. 1a,b, n = 22/21 control/HSD males; F(3,82) Value = 22.45, Prob > F = 1.05E−10, ***p = 9.68E−4, q-Value = 5.57). Female mice, however, had comparable body weights (female control weighed 20.93 ± 0.54 g, HSD-fed female weighed 20.2 ± 0.22 g; Fig. 1a,b, n = 21/22 control/HSD females; p = 0.704, q-Value = 1.52).

After our 8-week feeding protocol a subset of mice was paired to breed, control-fed males and females (n = 14 pairs), or HSD-fed males and females (n = 15 pairs). We kept each breeding pair fed with the same food of their feeding protocol until their offspring reached weaning age. We did not observe any significant difference in fertility (Fig. 1c, 92% pregnancy rate in control-fed vs. 100% in HSD-fed pairs, p = 0.37, unpaired T-test, t-score = 1.414), as well as number of pups born per litter (Fig. 1d, 6.64 ± 0.59 pups/litter in control vs. 5.73 ± 0.76 pups/litter in HSD pairs, p = 0.358, unpaired T-test, t-score = 0.941). Overall, these results indicate that 8 weeks of HSD do not significantly impair reproduction in mice.

To investigate the direct effects of HSD on exploratory behaviors and memory function, we performed a series of well-established behavioral assays: open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM), novel object recognition (NOR) test and T-maze alternation test. Figure 2a shows the average total distance traveled in the OFT for all groups, where no significant differences were found (control-fed males n = 9, total distance = 1587.39 ± 104.99 cm; HSD-fed males n = 8, total distance = 1773.04 ± 82.74 cm, p = 0.53, q-Value = 1.94; control-fed females n = 8, total distance = 1637.82 ± 123.31 cm; HSD-fed females n = 8, total distance = 1612.77 ± 61.35 cm, p = 0.99, q-Value = 0.25; F(3,29) Value = 0.73, Prob > F = 0.54). Furthermore, we calculated the percentage of time spent in the center area (%center) of the OFT arena (Fig. 2b) and found no difference between HSD and control-fed mice as well (%center in control males = 53.79 ± 5.05% vs. HSD-fed males = 50.18 ± 3.22%; F(3,29) Value = 2.03, Prob > F = 0.13, p = 0.94, q-Value = 0.79; control-fed females = 47.43 ± 3.92%; HSD-fed females = 38.56 ± 5.55%; p = 0.53, q-Value = 1.90). Similarly, while there was a slight tendency towards HSD-fed groups spending less time in the EPM open arms, the statistical analysis showed no statistically significant difference compared to the control-fed groups (Fig. 2c, time spent in the open arms in control male = 17.5 ± 5.05%; HSD-fed male = 9.2 ± 2.11%, p = 0.38, q-Value = 2.31; control-fed females = 15.7 ± 3.42; HSD-fed females = 11.0 ± 2.58, p = 0.804, q-Value = 1.275; F(3,29) Value = 1.16, Prob > F = 0.34).

In addition, we evaluated working memory using the T-maze alternation test, and spatial memory using the NOR test (both short- and long-term). Figure 2d shows that control and HSD-fed mice displayed a similar performance in the T-maze. On average, the spontaneous alternation in the control-fed male group was 57.15 ± 3.32% versus 55.03 ± 3.31% in the HSD-fed male group (p = 0.98, q-Value = 0.58; F(3,29) Value = 0.58, Prob > F = 0.63). Comparably, the control-fed females showed 50.78 ± 4.33% alternation versus 52.65 ± 3.81% in the HSD-fed group (p = 0.98, q-Value = 0.49). In the NOR test we quantified the time that mice spent exploring the novel object after either 1 or 24 h post-training period (Fig. 2e,f, see “Methods” section for specific details). We first compared this value to the 50% chance between both objects (i.e. 150 out of 300 s total time). Male mice fed with control diet spent on average 187.8 ± 7.35 s interacting with the novel object during the NOR test after 1 h of training (p = 0.00134, One sample t-test), while females spent 167.3 ± 20.1 s which was not statistically different from 50% chance (p = 0.418, One sample t-test). The HSD-fed group did not show significant impairment in either short- or long-term term memory formation, although there was a clear trend to reduced short-term performance in males (Fig. 2e). On average control-fed male mice spent 187.8 ± 7.35 s exploring the novel object 1 h after the training session, compared to 129.01 ± 11.43 s in the HSD-fed group (p = 0.07, q-Value = 3.62; F(3,27) Value = 2.2.71, Prob > F = 0.06). Similarly, female mice fed with HSD spent 140.88 ± 19.86 s exploring the novel object compared to 167.3 ± 20.1 s in the control fed group (p = 0.64 vs. control-fed, q-Value = 1.68). Comparable results were observed 24 h after the training session (Fig. 2f). As done with the 1 h NOR test, we first compared the control value with the 50% chance between both objects. Male mice fed with control food spent on average 194.95 ± 16.13 s interacting with the novel object after 24 h (p = 0.027, One sample t-test), while females spent 202.43 ± 9.21 s interacting with the novel object (p = 0.0074 vs. 50% chance, One sample t-test). When comparing with HSD-fed mice, we found that control-fed male mice spent 194.95 ± 16.13 s exploring the novel object versus 152.88 ± 23.31 s in the HSD-fed male group (p = 0.41, q-Value = 2.22; F(3,29) Value = 2.29, Prob > F = 0.10). Female mice showed comparable results. Control-fed female mice spent 202.43 ± 9.21 s versus 146.20 ± 23.41 s observed in the HSD-fed group (p = 0.18, q-Value = 2.97). Taken together, and consistent with previous reports19, our results show that 8-week of HSD did not significantly alter the measured behaviors in our mice.

Maternal microbiome can transfer to the offspring during birth6. It has also been shown that elevated salt consumption can lead to changes in the maternal gut microbiome composition17,18. Therefore, we reasoned that it is possible that our feeding protocol could be altering the maternal gut microbiome and that this microbiome could be then transferred to the offspring. To test this hypothesis, we collected fecal samples from females in the parental group (i.e. from both control and HSD-fed mothers or dams) and their offspring mice (i.e. at 2–3 weeks old, before weaning). We then performed 16 s rRNA amplicon sequencing (see “Methods” section for details) to obtain an accurate description of their gut microbiome composition.

Overall, our data also suggests that as the maternal gut microbiome is likely transferred to the offspring during the first postnatal weeks, it provides a route for shaping the initial microbial population in the offspring that could be altered according to the maternal diet.

Previous studies have shown that HSD can induce immune system dysregulation in mice19–21. Therefore, we collected trunk blood samples from a group of dams after several weeks in HSD or control diet and measured specific cytokine levels. Blood collection was carried out at the time litters were weaned at postnatal day 28. Figure 4a shows that in HSD-fed mice the IL-17 concentration was not different from control-fed mice. On average we measured 19.68 ± 4.58 pg/ml in control versus 17.33 ± 3.77 pg/ml in HSD-fed mice (control, n = 9, HSD, n = 9, p = 0.60, t-score = 0.39, unpaired t-test). In addition, we measured the concentration of IL-1β, IL-23, TNF-α, and IL-10. Similar to IL-17, neither TNF-α nor IL-10 were different between diet treatments (Fig. 4b–c). We measured 32.37 ± 10.84 pg/ml of TNF-α in control versus 24.04 ± 10.39 pg/ml in HSD-fed mice (control n = 9, HSD n = 8, p = 0.50, t-score = 0.55). IL-10 was 64.91 ± 30.38 pg/ml in control versus 114.83 ± 31.06 pg/ml in HSD-fed female mice (control, n = 6, HSD, n = 8, p = 0.28, t-score = − 1.12). Furthermore, we found that while there was trend towards reduced values, IL-1β and IL-23 were not statistically reduced in HSD-fed dams (Fig. d–e). In fact, the concentration of IL-1β was 156.62 ± 41.35 pg/ml in control versus 78.73 ± 26.04 pg/ml in HSD-fed female mice (control, n = 9, HSD, n = 9, p = 0.13, t-score = 1.60). IL-23 concentration was 156.43 ± 40.00 pg/ml in control and 90.65 ± 27.73 pg/ml in HSD-fed female mice (control, n = 8, HSD, n = 9; p = 0.19, t-score = 1.36). Taken together, these results indicate that while our HSD protocol resulted in altered gut microbiome composition, it did not increase the serum concentration of proinflammatory molecules.

We investigated potential long-term effects of parental HSD on their offspring behavior, focusing on exploration, repetitive and social behaviors. At the time of weaning, we transitioned all offspring mice to control diet and regular water (i.e. no added NaCl) to avoid direct effects of diet on their behavior.

Altogether our results show important sex-dependent long-term effects associated with parental HSD. Specifically, male offspring from HSD-fed parents showed hyperactivity, social preference deficits and increased repetitive behavior. Interestingly, these alterations closely resemble other animal models of ASD36 suggesting the possibility that HSD could be an environmental risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders.

In this study we showed that: (1) the altered parental microbiome is shared with their offspring (likely transmitted during birth and first postnatal weeks), (2) these changes can be detrimental for neurodevelopment, and (3) altered gut microbiome is associated with ASD-like behavioral abnormalities in the offspring adulthood, changes that are only visible in male mice.

Though the initial gut microbiome is essential for normal brain development, how the HSD-associated decrease in Lactobacillus leads to ASD-like behavioral abnormalities, is still unclear. Gut Lactobacillus was found to regulate emotional behavior and GABA expression in mice68. Further, the Shank3 KO mice (established ASD model) has reduced gut Lactobacillus abundance as well as reduced expression GABA receptors in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, changes that were reversed by the probiotic administration of a strain of Lactobacillus spp69. In addition, low levels of Lactobacillus were also associated with reduced levels of hypothalamic oxytocin in mice66. Our results show that the offspring from HSD-fed parents has reduced level of Lactobacillus, most likely passed from their mother. Therefore, we can speculate that low Lactobacillus abundance might hamper the expression of GABA receptors and secretion of oxytocin hormone in the male offspring from HSD-fed parents, which ultimately results in ASD-like behavior. More extensive studies are needed to dissect the mechanism underlying the association between low gut Lactobacillus abundance and ASD-like behaviors.
