Gut microbiome dysbiosis in patients with hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma after extended hepatectomy liver failure

Hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (B-HCC) negatively affects the gut microbiome. This study aimed to investigate the gut microbiome profiles and functions post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) after extended hepatectomy (e-PHLF) to obtain valuable insights, identify potential diagnostic biomarkers, and assist in the treatment of this disease.

B-HCC patients who underwent extended hepatectomy were consecutively recruited and divided into Group A (n=15) and Group B (n=15) based on the presence and absence of e-PHLF, respectively. The relationships between gut microbiota and extended hepatectomy liver failure were explored using 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing data.

Following extended hepatectomy, the α-diversity of Group A was significantly higher than that of Group B (Shannon P=0.034 or Simpson P=0.031), and the β-diversity differed significantly between Groups A and B (P=0.004, R=0.100). At the genus level, 10 bacterial genera (Bacteroides, Pantoea, Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum, Inquilinus, Mycobacterium, Allisonella, Helicobacter, GCA-900066575, IS-44, and Faecalibacterium) were significantly enriched in Group A, whereas five genera (Papillibacter, Scardovia, Turicibacter, Catabacter, and Senegalimassilia) were significantly enriched in Group B. The highly abundant genera Bacteroides, Pantoea, Faecalibacterium, and Turicibacter participated in multiple amino acid metabolism pathways, organic acid metabolism pathways, pyrimidine metabolism pathways, palmitate biosynthesis, and stearate biosynthesis. Redundancy analysis showed that four environmental factors (total bilirubin, international normalized ratio, prealbumin, and albumin) were significantly correlated with intestinal microorganisms. The formation of interaction networks between different gut microbiomes revealed important correlations between the gut microbiome, and there was a significant correlation between the highly abundant gut microbiome and main functions.

The gut microbiota characteristics in B-HCC patients after extended hepatectomy liver failure might allow for the use of non-invasive biomarkers for disease diagnosis and treatment.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with a relatively higher incidence rate in developing countries, including China (1-3). The main causes of HCC in the Chinese population are viral hepatitis or cirrhosis, especially the hepatitis B virus (4,5). Currently, numerous therapeutic approaches have been applied for treating HCC, such as surgical resection, liver transplantation, ablation treatments (3,6), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) (7), radiotherapy (8), and targeted therapy (9). In advanced cases, tyrosine-protein kinase inhibitors (i.e., sorafenib) are considered conventional first-line therapy (10), whereas immune-checkpoint inhibitors are regarded as new treatment options with a limited therapeutic response (11). Surgical treatment is still the most commonly used and effective treatment method for HCC, despite the advances in the treatment mode development and application (12).

The core treatment method for liver cancer is still hepatectomy, despite the dangers of PHLF. Although the relationship between the gut microbiota and liver diseases is widely recognized, there remains a lack of clinical studies exploring the relationship between PHLF after extended hepatectomy (e-PHLF) and the intestinal microbiome. In the present study, we recruited 30 patients with B-HCC who met the inclusion criteria and performed 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing to identify significant differences in gut microbial abundance and composition related to e-PHLF and non-e-PHLF patients as well as multiple environmental factors. Our data might help reduce the incidence rate of e-PHLF and improve therapeutic outcomes. We present the following article in accordance with the MDAR reporting checklist (available at https://atm.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/atm-22-1958/rc).

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in 2013). The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital (No. KY2019009) and informed consent was taken from all the patients.

All patients who were initially diagnosed with B-HCC (Child-Pugh Class A) and only treated with extended hepatectomy at the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital (Nanning, China), from September 2020 to May 2021 were recruited in this study. Patients with a history of alcohol addiction, drug allergy, chronic infectious diseases, metabolic diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver, malignant tumors in sites other than the liver, gastrointestinal disease, or diabetes were excluded from the study. None of the participants received any pro-gastrointestinal prokinetic agents, acid suppressants, probiotics, or antibiotics within 4 weeks before surgery.

Our analysis cohort included 30 patients with (Group A, n=15) or without (Group B, n=15) e-PHLF according to the International Study Group of Liver Surgery (ISGLS) (33). Groups A and B were further divided into pre-operation (Ebo.PHLF and Enbo.PHLF, respectively) and post-operation (Eao.PHLF and Enao.PHLF, respectively) groups. Fecal samples were collected at 1 d pre-hepatectomy and 5 d post-hepatectomy, and were immediately stored at −80 ℃.

Bacterial DNA was extracted from each fecal sample using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method and used for library construction. The V3–V4 region of the bacterial small-subunit 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the primer pair, 341F (5'-CCTAYGGGRBGCASCAG-3')/806R (5'-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3'), as well as and universal sequencing primers. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were purified using the Genejet Gel Extraction kit (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The amplicon libraries were constructed using the TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Sample Preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The quality of the library was assessed using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) and the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Novaseq6000 platform.

Quality filtering and analysis of the original FASTQ file were performed using FLASH 1.2.7 (http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/FLASH/) (34) and Qiime 1.9.1 (http://qiime.org/scripts/split_libraries_fastq.html) (35). Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained using Uparse 7.0.1001 (http://www.drive5.com/uparse/), according to a sequence identity of >97%, and were used to classify bacteria at the genus level (36). Subsequent analyses of α- and β-diversity were performed using OTU normalized data at the phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species levels. Statistical differences in bacterial composition between the groups were assessed using an analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) with the weighted UniFrac. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) method was performed to identify differentially-represented biomarker(s) between Groups A and B. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed to identify any associations between the microbial composition and environmental factors. PICRUST2 (37) was applied to functional information from the Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes system to predict metabolic pathways based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. The read abundance data for all predicted pathways were converted into relative abundance (%). The co-occurrence network pattern displayed any relationships in the gut microbiome, and also between gut microbiota and different functions. The relationship between gut microbiome and function was investigated using Spearman’s rank-order correlation.

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Differences between groups were identified using Fisher’s exact test and t-test. Analysis of α- and β-diversity was performed using QIIME 1.9.1 and R (version 2.15.3). LEfSe combines the standard tests for statistical significance (Kruskal-Wallis test and pairwise Wilcoxon test) with LDA. The threshold for the logarithmic LDA score of the discriminative features was set at 3.0. The Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was used for comparisons between groups using R 2.15.3. A permutation test at P<0.05 was used to select a set of environmental factors that significantly affected the microbial distribution. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. The co-occurrence network pattern, RDA, and Spearman correlations were depicted using R 3.6.2, and any corrections were performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

The demographic and clinical characteristics of Groups A and B pre-hepatectomy, along with the operation time and intraoperative bleeding volume, are summarized in Table 1. Except for the liver failure severity grading (P<0.001), no other indices were significantly different between the two groups.

Different microbial taxa were reflected by OTUs. In total, 890 OTUs were observed in Ebo.PHLF vs. Enbo.PHLF; 1,186 in Eao.PHLF vs. Enao.PHLF; 1,522 in Eao.PHLF vs. Ebo.PHLF; and 1,357 in Enao.PHLF vs. Enbo.PHLF (Figure 1A). In order to understand the differences in microbial community structure between different groups, alpha diversity was measured using the Shannon and Simpson indices. The gut microbiota of Eao.PHLF indices were all higher than those of Enao.PHLF (P=0.034 and P=0.031, respectively), but there were no significant differences between Ebo.PHLF and Enbo.PHLF (Figure 1B). As shown in Figure 2A, β-diversity was based on the weighted UniFrac and was represented by principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), which showed that Ebo.PHLF vs. Enbo.PHLF, P=0.081 and R=0.051; Eao.PHLF vs. Enao.PHLF, P=0.004 and R=0.100; Eao.PHLF vs. Ebo.PHLF, P=0.002, R=0.180; and Enao.PHLF vs. Enbo.PHLF, P=0.001, R=0.220. Overall, these results revealed differences in the gut microbial structure and abundance between Eao.PHLF and Enao.PHLF.

The top 10 bacterial abundances at the phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels in Ebo.PHLF, Enbo.PHLF, Eao.PHLF, and Enao.PHLF are shown in Figure S1 & Figure 2B. At the phylum level, the top 10 bacterial members in Ebo.PHLF, Enbo.PHLF, Eao.PHLF, and Enao.PHLF were identical, with some proportional differences: Firmicutes (56.32–47.54%), Bacteroidetes (7.37–24.27%), Proteobacteria (11.31–23.12%), Verrucomicrobiota (0.14–5.30%), Actinobacteriota (2.40–7.97%), Fusobacteriota (0.26–3.15%), unidentified bacteria (0.35–1.60%), Euryarchaeota (0.06–0.91%), Acidobacteriota (0.03–0.28%), and Chloroflexi (0.03–0.25%). The dominant bacteria in Eao.PHLF (21.15%) and Enao.PHLF (7.37%) were Bacteroidota.

In addition, the postoperative values in high-abundance species were not significantly different from the preoperative values, except for those of Faecalibacterium. Thus, the postoperative alterations in bacterial taxa might be reliable microbial markers for detecting the occurrence of liver failure. We also found an interaction network between differential bacteria in Eao.PHLF vs. Enao.PHLF and Ebo.PHLF vs. Enbo.PHLF, as well as in the top 30 bacteria (Figure S2B).

Analysis of the functional capacity of the gut microbiota in Eao.PHLF vs. Enao.PHLF predicted 57 pathways related to the differential gut microbiome at the genus level. As shown in Figure 5 and Table 2, the microbial metabolic pathways mainly included multiple amino acid metabolic pathways, organic acid metabolism pathways, pyrimidine metabolism pathways, palmitate biosynthesis, and stearate biosynthesis.

The relationship between the environmental factors and different microbial compositions was analyzed in Eao.PHLF vs. Enao.PHLF. For bacteria and Eao.PHLF vs. Enao.PHLF, the RDA axes 1 and 2 accounted for 42.1% and 26.85% of the total variation, respectively. The permutation test at P<0.05 showed that total bilirubin (TBIL), international normalized ratio (INR), prealbumin (PA), and albumin (ALB) were associated with differential bacterial compositions in Eao.PHLF vs. Enao.PHLF. Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Pantoea were positively correlated with TBIL, INR, and ALB, but negatively correlated with PA. Turicibacter was negatively correlated with TBIL, INR, and ALB, but positively correlated with PA (Figure 6A).

In Eao.PHLF vs. Enao.PHLF, 15 different gut microbiota and the top 30 functional groups were well suited to display the interaction between the microbiome and various functions (Figure 6B). In particular, high-abundance species, including Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Pantoea, and Turicibacter, were found to play a significant role in the association between major metabolic pathways, including multiple amino acid metabolic pathways, organic acid metabolism pathways, pyrimidine metabolism pathways, palmitate biosynthesis, and stearate biosynthesis, suggesting their central role in the Eao.PHLF vs. Enao.PHLF microbiome (Figure 6C).

The gut microbiome is considered a “hidden organ” that regulates human health, including liver function. It seems to play a complex role in the progression of liver diseases, and thus, identifying any alterations in intestinal microbial composition might help to establish novel therapeutic targets (38). Extended hepatectomy is a well-established risk factor for PHLF. Previous study has explored the correlation between liver diseases and gut microbiota; however, information on any changes in the intestinal flora of B-HCC patients with or without PHLF is still limited (39). In our study, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify differential gut microbiota in Eao.PHLF vs. Enao.PHLF that could be used as non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment in B-HCC patients with e-PHLF.

Our study had some limitations that should be noted. Firstly, the number of patients involved was small, and thus, our findings need to be confirmed in a more extensive cohort. Secondly, we only used 16S rRNA gene sequencing data, and hence, metagenomics needs to be involved for further investigation and functional analysis. Lastly, we only identified associations between e-PHLF and the gut microbiome, without providing direct causal evidence. Therefore, research in isolation and cultivation strains as well as animal models will be beneficial to elucidate the mechanism of intestinal bacteria in e-PHLF.

In this study, we analyzed the changes in the composition and diversity of gut bacteria in B-HCC patients with extended hepatectomy, and identified specific microbiotas that could be used as diagnostic biomarkers for e-PHLF. Overall, our data might assist in the development of novel strategies for minimizing the occurrence of e-PHLF.
