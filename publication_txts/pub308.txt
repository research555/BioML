Influence of maternal breast milk ingestion on acquisition of the intestinal microbiome in preterm infants



The initial acquisition and early development of the intestinal microbiome during infancy are important to human health across the lifespan. Mode of birth, antibiotic administration, environment of care, and nutrition have all been shown to play a role in the assembly of the intestinal microbiome during early life. For preterm infants, who are disproportionately at risk of inflammatory intestinal disease (i.e., necrotizing enterocolitis), a unique set of clinical factors influence the establishment of the microbiome. The purpose of this study was to establish the influence of nutritional exposures on the intestinal microbiome in a cohort of preterm infants early in life.

Principal component analysis of 199 samples from 30 preterm infants (<32 weeks) over the first 60 days following birth showed that the intestinal microbiome was influenced by postnatal time (p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.13), birth weight (p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.08), and nutrition (p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.21). Infants who were fed breast milk had a greater initial bacterial diversity and a more gradual acquisition of diversity compared to infants who were fed infant formula. The microbiome of infants fed breast milk were more similar regardless of birth weight (p = 0.049), in contrast to the microbiome of infants fed infant formula, which clustered differently based on birth weight (p < 0.001). By adjusting for differences in gut maturity, an ordered succession of microbial phylotypes was observed in breast milk-fed infants, which appeared to be disrupted in those fed infant formula. Supplementation with pasteurized donor human milk was partially successful in promoting a microbiome more similar to breast milk-fed infants and moderating rapid increases in bacterial diversity.

The preterm infant intestinal microbiome is influenced by postnatal time, birth weight, gestational age, and nutrition. Feeding with breast milk appears to mask the influence of birth weight, suggesting a protective effect against gut immaturity in the preterm infant. These findings suggest not only a microbial mechanism underpinning the body of evidence showing that breast milk promotes intestinal health in the preterm infant but also a dynamic interplay of host and dietary factors that facilitate the colonization of and enrichment for specific microbes during establishment of the preterm infant microbiota.

The initial acquisition and early development of the intestinal microbiome during infancy are important to human health across the lifespan [1–3]. Several factors influence the assembly of the intestinal microbiome during infancy. Mode of birth [4], antibiotic administration [5], environment of care [6], and nutritional exposures, and most notably breastfeeding [7] have all been shown to play an important role in acquisition of the intestinal microbiome. Exposure to breast milk during infancy appears to be particularly important in shaping the microbiome [8]. Among preterm infants, gestational age at birth and postnatal age at observation have also been shown to be relevant to the characteristics of their microbiome [9]. We know from clinical studies that exclusively breastfed full-term infants harbor specific health-promoting bacteria (“pioneer” bacteria) that are associated with improved immune status [8, 10]. We also know that the microbiota of breast- vs. formula-fed infants have a more profound effect on neonatal enterocyte genes that influence host protection and development [10]. What is not known is the impact of ingested expressed breast milk from mothers delivering prematurely on the composition of the preterm infant’s intestinal microbiome.

Recognizing that breast milk influences initial bacterial colonization and that MBM given to preterm infants can prevent NEC, we analyzed the influence of different forms of infant nutrition on the initial colonization process in 30 preterm infants. Few longitudinal studies evaluating the influence of nutrition on the preterm infant’s intestinal microbiome have been conducted, and to our knowledge, no study has evaluated the influence of PDHM on the early acquisition of the intestinal microbiome and how this differs from MBM and infant formula. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the composition of the intestinal microbiome of 30 preterm infants born <32 weeks of gestation for a period of approximately 6 weeks after birth who had been exposed to different nutritional regimens.

This study included three groups of 10 preterm infants born prior to 32 weeks of gestation (n = 30). The infants were grouped based on a predominant diet of MBM, PDHM, or IF. Stool samples were collected daily while the infant was hospitalized, and weekly samples were analyzed for microbiome compositional differences using 16S rDNA-based sequencing.

As shown in Fig. 1, 40% of the variance in microbiome composition is explained by the first three principal components (Bray-Curtis PCA, which best explained the variance in the data among the metrics tested; see “Methods” section). In Fig. 1a, the clustering in microbiome samples based on diet are shown, where the majority of the MBM samples cluster separately from the IF samples. Figure 1b shows that the birth weight of the infant at the time of birth also contributes to the clustering of the microbiome, with infants born less than 1000 g (ELBW) grouped separately from infants born greater than 1000 g (VLBW). MBM samples cluster together regardless of birth weight, whereas IF samples formed two clusters by birth weight and gestational age. Figure 1c illustrates that postnatal week of life also appears to have a dominant role in determining microbiome composition that is largely independent of diet, as most samples after the first 3 weeks of life (“late”) clustered together along PC1 (18% of variance) separate from all of the samples within this period (“early”). This clustering is further supported based on unweighted UniFrac-based analyses of microbiome composition (Fig. 2).

Following the initial PCA analyses that highlighted the importance of the infant’s age following birth (i.e., week of life) with regard to diet in our analyses, we sought to identify the differences in diversity (as assessed using Shannon indices; listed in Additional file 1: Table S2) over time in the microbiome between the different infant feeding groups. To account for the non-independence of the samples given that multiple samples were collected from the same infant over time, we used a linear mixed-effects modeling approach (similar to [20]) in order to control for the non-independence of the samples and account for different trajectories based on gestational age of the infants. All three nutrition groups exhibit a significant increase in bacterial diversity over postnatal time (Fig. 3a and Additional file 1: Table S3), though the groups are especially distinct with regard to the trajectories with which they increase in diversity from birth over the 60-day period. Bacterial diversity levels started more simply but rapidly increased to higher ultimate diversity levels in IF- and PDHM-fed samples compared to matched MBM-fed infant samples that exhibited a more measured initial increase in diversity. Further, variance and confidence intervals for the models of PDHM- and IF-fed infants were notably high. Adjusting for gestational age better accounted for the differences in trajectories for all nutritional groups (Fig. 3b), that is, there was a 13–579% reduction in overall variance with almost no variance (0.0001) observed in random effects models for MBM infants diversity trajectories, as well as both strong correlations to the model fit lines and much lower confidence intervals for both PDHM- and IF-fed infants (Fig. 3c). This suggests again that gestational age (or gut maturity) had as much influence on the diversity of the microbiome as any dietary regimen.

We also observed that infant formula-fed infants appear to be most susceptible to differences in gut maturity compared to MBM-fed infants. Stratification of the groups based on birth weight or birth gestational age and week of life [early <3 weeks vs. late >3 weeks] suggested that microbial diversity for both IF-fed babies and to a lesser extent PDHM-fed babies were significantly influenced by gut maturity in late samples, whereas MBM-fed babies exhibited no significant differences in bacterial diversity (Additional file 2: Figure S2).

As seen in Fig. 4a (and Additional file 1: Table S3), the preterm infant gut is overwhelmingly comprised of species from Bacillales and Lactobacillales until approximately 28–30 weeks of adjusted gestational age, particularly in IF-fed infants, and most strikingly in IF (and to a lesser extent PDHM)-fed ELBW infants that retain high levels of Lactobacillales during the entire period monitored. The infants fed MBM have a greater initial diversity in their microbiome that is most strongly influenced by the presence of a variety of phylotypes that include lower levels of Bacillales and Lactobacillales, in favor of Clostridia, and Enterobacteriales as early as 26 weeks of adjusted gestational age.

Furthermore, we employed linear effect size feature selection (LEfSe; [21]) to identify specific taxa that were significantly associated with either MBM or IF diets (Fig. 6). Enterobacteriales (specifically the Citrobacter) and select Clostridiales (specifically Clostridium, Ruminococcus, and Negativicoccus) were identified as the best discriminators of MBM-fed infants. For IF-fed infants, Lactobacillales (specifically Streptococcus), Bacillus, and a distinct Clostridiales (Anaerococcus) were associated with this group. The negative correlations in taxa relative abundance observed above (Additional file 3: Figure S3) between Citrobacter and Bacillus likely reflect diet-driven differences in these infant microbiomes. Together, these analyses indicate that there are at least a handful of signature taxa that characterize each nutritional regimen once a threshold of gut maturity is achieved.

We know that initial colonization of the newborn gut influences the development of intestinal host defense [22, 23] and appropriate development may have a profound effect on immune health during infancy and throughout life [24]. This is in part because intestinal immune health is immature at birth and develops in conjunction with the initial colonization process. A disruption in colonization and development of intestinal host defense may account for the increase in allergy and immune-mediated morbidity (i.e., autoimmune disease) in developed countries over the last half century [25].

The studies reported here suggest that expressed MBM has a significant impact on initial colonization of the preterm infant’s intestine and differs from other forms of neonatal nutrition. Moreover, this work suggests that the association of nutrition and microbiota may be key for maintaining intestinal health and in turn the prevention of NEC in this patient population. However, to demonstrate a direct association, further analyses are needed that employ a combination of isolates of specific species and in vitro techniques that we have pioneered (e.g., a fetal human small intestinal cell line (H4 cells) [42], fetal intestinal organ cultures [43], fetal intestinal xenografts [44], and organoids [45]), which could help to determine if these species specific breast milk-stimulated bacteria inhibit the intestinal inflammatory response. These observations should provide possible new probiotic protocols in combination with expressed breast milk that can be used in clinical trials and then possibly incorporated into routine care of the preterm infant.

The preterm infant intestinal microbiome is influenced by postnatal time, gestational age, birth weight, and nutritional exposures. Feeding with MBM appears to mask the influence of birth weight, suggesting a protective effect against gut immaturity of the preterm infant early in life. Further study is needed regarding the influence of feeding with PDHM or IF on acquisition of the intestinal microbiome, which based on our results appears to occur in a gestational age dependent manner. These findings not only suggest a microbial mechanism underpinning the body of evidence showing that breast milk promotes intestinal health of the preterm infant, but also the dynamic interplay of host and dietary factors that facilitate the colonization of and enrichment for specific microbes during establishment of the preterm infant intestinal microbiota.

The infants included in this study were an otherwise healthy population of preterm infants born prior to 32 weeks of gestation. The cohort of infants was carefully assembled such that there were three groups of 10 infants that differed only on their nutritional exposures of MBM, PDHM, and IF. Inclusion in one of the three groups required that the infant be fed 100% MBM, 100% IF, or the hospital’s PDHM protocol. Within the three groups of infants, other than nutritional history, there were no statistically significant differences in gestational age, birth weight, or mode of delivery. Neonatal morbidities such as incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), sepsis, or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) were also used as exclusion criteria for selection of this cohort and thus were also not significantly different between the study groups. The considerations given to study design and cohort assembly in this research resulted in our ability to evaluate the influence of diet on the preterm infant intestinal microbiome over time. These results are shown in Table 1. The study design is shown in Additional file 4: Figure S1 along with accompanying sample metadata in Additional file 1: Table S1.

All study procedures followed a protocol that was approved by the Partner’s Human Research Committee (IRB) for Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital (Protocol #2012-P-002453). All infants were born at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA, and cared for in a single-center Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Fecal samples were collected from preterm infants born prior to 32 weeks of gestation from birth until discharge or 60 days of life, whichever came first. Briefly, diapers with fecal samples were collected daily by the bedside nurse, placed in a specimen bag, and stored at 4 °C for no more than 24 h. Samples were processed daily, which involved extraction of fecal material from infant diapers using sterile procedures, and immediately frozen at −80 °C degrees until analyzed. The nutritional intake of the infants was prospectively monitored but never influenced by this observational study. When infants who were fed predominantly 100% MBM, 100% IF, or the standard hospital’s PDHM protocol were identified, their fecal samples were selected for analysis in this study. Following the hospital protocol, infants who were fed PDHM transitioned to IF after they achieved full enteral feeding (defined as >140 cc/kg/day). In addition, infants on this protocol weighing less than 1000 g at birth were required to exceed 1000 g in weight prior to transitioning from PDHM to IF.

Adjusted gestational age is calculated by adding postnatal day to gestational age at birth. For example, an infant born at 24 weeks who is now 16 days old has an adjusted gestational age of 26 weeks and 2 days, and an infant who is born at 26 weeks who is now 2 days old has an adjusted gestational age of 26 weeks and 2 days. Adjusted gestational age, sometimes called corrected age or post conceptual age, is often used to give a more accurate assessment of the overall maturity of the preterm infant and to compare across infants regardless of gestational age at birth.

Samples were stored at −80 °C until the time of analysis. At the time of analysis, DNA was isolated from approximately 200 mg of fecal material using a commercially available kit that included a bead-beating step (MO-Bio, Carlsbad, CA). Isolated DNA from these samples (n = 221) was then arrayed into 96-well plates, quality determined (agarose gel), quantity normalized (by nanodrop and/or PicoGreen), and stored at −20 °C until further processing. The V4–V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using 515 F (5′- CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG -3′) and 806R (5′- CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGT -3′) with unique Golay-barcoded primers (on the reverse primer) and sequencing adapters as described in the Earth Microbiome Project (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/; [46]). To construct sequencing libraries, amplicons were purified and pooled to equimolar concentrations (PicoGreen), then sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq sequencer (paired-end 250-bp reads with v2 500 cycles kit).

For estimates of alpha diversity (within sample) and taxa relative abundance, samples were rarefied to 2145 sequences to allow for inclusion of all samples, while beta-diversity (between sample) metrics were rarefied to 6945 sequences (191 total samples) to allow for greater discrimination of microbiome composition. Alpha diversity metrics—i.e., Shannon index (H′)—were computed within QIIME using default parameters and plotted using phyloseq [52]. Principle component analyses (PCA) were completed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distance matrices [53] to facilitate comparisons of presence/absence patterns between samples; Bray-Curtis matrices best explained the variance of the samples (highest % variation explained by the top three PCA coordinates), though weighted and unweighted UniFrac metrics [51, 54] (among others) were also examined.

Infant microbiome characteristics were assessed for their significance using the R software package (version 3.2.4; http://www.r-project.org/). Normally distributed variables (i.e., Shannon index) were statistically tested by an unpaired t test for two independent groups or a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple independent groups. Changes in diversity over time were evaluated by linear mixed-effects modeling in R using the nlme::lme package (v3.1-128; [55]). The infant was included as a random effect for both the intercept and the slope of the estimated fit for analyses of postnatal day and adjusted gestational age, while birth gestational age was also included in models based on postnatal days [nlme formulas − adjusted gestational age, ~1 + AdjSampleGestAge | InfantID; postnatal day, ~1 + SamplePNDay | InfantID + 1 | BirthGestAge]. Non-normally distributed variables (e.g., UniFrac, Bray-Curtis PCA) were statistically tested using PERMANOVA test followed by a Mann-Whitney U test for two independent groups or a Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple independent groups. Similar to diversity measures, significance of taxa relative abundance was determined using linear mixed-effects modeling as a function of adjusted gestational age using Calypso (http://bioinfo.qimr.edu.au/calypso/) [LME formula − relative taxa abundance = InfantID + AdjSampleGestAge + StudyGroup]. We sought to minimize the prevalence of zeros by summarizing taxa differences at the class level (<10% of values) and minimize the influence of the remaining zeros by transforming the datasets using arcsin square root methods (similar to [9, 56]) prior to building the LME models of relative taxa abundance. There are recent methods that explicitly address zero-inflated datasets (i.e., ZIBR [57]); however, the requirements for samples at the same timepoints in every condition were incompatible with our cohort even after imputation of missing samples [<30% of samples able to be used over a narrow range in adjusted gestational age (32–34 weeks)]. Perhaps, with a larger cohort of infants and relaxed tolerance of such datasets in future versions of the software, these limitations can be overcome.
