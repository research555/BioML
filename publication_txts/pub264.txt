COVID-19 severity is associated with population-level gut microbiome variations



The human gut microbiome interacts with many diseases, with recent small studies suggesting a link with COVID-19 severity. Exploring this association at the population-level may provide novel insights and help to explain differences in COVID-19 severity between countries. We explore whether there is an association between the gut microbiome of people within different countries and the severity of COVID-19, measured as hospitalisation rate. We use data from the large (n = 3,055) open-access gut microbiome repository curatedMetagenomicData, as well as demographic and country-level metadata. Twelve countries were placed into two groups (high/low) according to COVID-19 hospitalisation rate before December 2020 (ourworldindata.com). We use an unsupervised machine learning method, Topological Data Analysis (TDA). This method analyses both the local geometry and global topology of a high-dimensional dataset, making it particularly suitable for population-level microbiome data. We report an association of distinct baseline population-level gut microbiome signatures with COVID-19 severity. This was found both with a PERMANOVA, as well as with TDA. Specifically, it suggests an association of anti-inflammatory bacteria, including Bifidobacteria species and Eubacterium rectale, with lower severity, and pro-inflammatory bacteria such as Prevotella copri with higher severity. This study also reports a significant impact of country-level confounders, specifically of the proportion of over 70-year-olds in the population, GDP, and human development index. Further interventional studies should examine whether these relationships are causal, as well as considering the contribution of other variables such as genetics, lifestyle, policy, and healthcare system. The results of this study support the value of a population-level association design in microbiome research in general and for the microbiome-COVID-19 relationship, in particular. Finally, this research underscores the potential of TDA for microbiome studies, and in identifying novel associations.

Despite the vast advances made in researching COVID-19 over the first two years of the pandemic, many of the mechanisms underpinning its severity and inter-individual variations in disease course are incompletely understood. This made it difficult to predict the likely severity within a given population and to plan patient flow at a regional and national level. Here, we explore the link between variations in the gut microbiome between countries and COVID severity. This is important as the gut microbiome is amenable to manipulation at the population level, potentially providing a novel intervention in future outbreaks and pandemics.

We hypothesise that there will be significant differences in microbiome composition between countries based on COVID-19 severity grouping that will be evident with standard analysis as well as TDA. We expect to find specific microbiome signatures to be associated with such groups of low and high severity. Specifically, we hypothesise that TDA will find more complex associations above and beyond those results from standard analysis. Finally, we expect to be able to discern the effects of relevant confounders.

This study used an open microbiome data source, curatedMetagenomicData (cMD) accessed through BioConductor (Pasolli et al., 2017). This dataset used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Because of its highly conserved nature, this technique now represents the standard application to the investigation of the microbiome (Gupta et al., 2019).

This filtering yielded 3,055 healthy gut microbiome samples from 12 countries. These were Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Great Britain, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, United States of America.

For each of these countries, COVID-19 severity data was obtained from Our World in Data (https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data), using hospitalisations as the preferred metric representing the number of COVID-19 patients in hospital on a given day. We chose severity to be operationalised by hospitalisations as it is the measure most likely to reflect the hypothesised immune-modulating effects of the microbiome, as opposed to factors relating to public policy or the healthcare system. These would have more influence on metrics of cases, test-positivity-rate, ICU beds, or fatality rates.

Finally, country-level confounding variables were collected that could present relevant confounders in the association between the microbiome and COVID-19 severity. The first of these is the proportion of over 70-year-olds in the population, as the older population is more at risk of severe COVID-19 (Damayanthi et al., 2021). The second includes two measures of wealth and industrialisation level: the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Human Development Index (HDI). These three measures were chosen as there is previous evidence that they are associated with COVID-19 fatality differences between countries which suggests potential relevance to COVID-19 severity in general (Sorci et al., 2020). Additionally, both age and wealth influence the microbiome (Bowyer et al., 2019; Badal et al., 2020), meaning there is potential for influence on the relationship between the microbiome and COVID-19, as well.

Standard microbiome analysis was performed in R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) using the curatedMetagenomicData (3.2.3), phyloseq (1.38.0), and microbiome (1.16.0) packages. Unsupervised Machine Learning with TDA was performed in Python 3.1.4 in a Jupyter Notebook environment, using mainly the pandas (1.2.4), NumPy (1.19.5), and tmap (1.0) libraries and seaborne (0.11.1) and matplotlib (3.3.4) for visualisations. All code is available on GitHub (via thesharmalab-team/microbiome_covid).

The composition of the gut microbiome by phylum was investigated using bar plots to observe differences in the overall relative abundance of phyla between the COVID-19 groups.

A permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was adopted to identify the top genus-level taxa which significantly differ between the COVID-19 groups. This further allows for the overall significance testing between the microbiome composition and the COVID-19 groups (permutations = 999).

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is an unsupervised machine learning tool based on algebraic topology and differential geometry (Carlsson, 2009). This means that it analyses the topological structure, or shape, of high-dimensional data without sacrificing complexity. TDA has many attributes that make it attractive for microbiome research, particularly its robustness to noise and sensitivity to signal. This enables it to detect even small and non-linear effects, as demonstrated in a previous study which showed that it outperformed standard microbiome tools (Liao et al., 2019). That study combined the TDA algorithm Mapper (Singh et al., 2007) with a modified version of the Spatial Analysis of Functional Enrichment algorithm (SAFE) (Baryshnikova, 2016) into a single library, tmap, for integrated stratification and association analysis of population microbiome data. This library is also used in this study.

The procedure used to implement tmap in this study is as follows. The first step is the optimisation of the cover ratio, which includes hand-tuning the parameters of overlap and resolution, as well as the minimum number of samples required to form a node. The cover ratio determines how sparse versus dense the graph network representation of the microbiome data will be. Based on these, the final Mapper network graph is calculated. Here, hand-tuning resulted in using a minimum number of samples of 7, resolution of 100 and overlap of 1.1. Then, all microbiome taxa and metadata variables are enriched using the SAFE algorithm. This is then used for metadata stratification, meaning the comparison of enrichment for groups. The final step is co-enrichment analysis, in which pairwise co-enrichment is calculated and a strict 0.5th percentile significance cut-off applied.

Table 1 shows the severity of COVID-19 by total hospitalisations and hospitalisation per 100,000 before the commencing of the vaccination programme.

This includes hospitalisation per 100,000 and the number of microbiome samples (Frequency) which are the basis of the grouping into low and high severity. Confounding factors are also included for each country: proportion over 70, GDP and HDI. These were obtained from the COVID-19 Dataset from Our World in Data.

Presented in Table 2 are the demographic factors for the cMD dataset (Gender, Age Group, and BMI) observed for the high and low Covid-19 grouping.

These are gender, age group, and BMI. These values were obtained from the cMD Dataset.

In assessing the relative abundances of phyla, an increase in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria and a decrease in Firmicutes and Actinobacteria is shown in the high group in comparison to the low group (Figure 2).

Extending from the overall differences in phyla abundances between the high and low groups (Figure 2), differences in top genus-level taxa were explored and observed in Figure 5. A noticeable higher proportion of Eubacterium rectale dominates the low group contrarily to the Prevotella copri in the high group. Overall multiple species of the Ruminococcus genus prevail in the low group. Both groups include the genus Bacteroides although distinct species are associated with them. The second most abundant genus-level taxa associated with the high and low group are Escherichia coli and Bifidobacterium adolescentis, respectively.

The analysis with TDA Mapper yields a graph network of the microbiome data that contains 1,323 nodes and 11,258 edges, with 1,125 (63.18%) samples lost.

Looking at the SAFE enriched scores of the metadata, it shows that both country-level metadata, namely proportion over 70 and GDP, as well as individual-level metadata, namely adult age and normal BMI were more highly enriched than the covid severity grouping (Figure 9).

This study is the first to apply a population-based indirect association approach to the association between the gut microbiome and COVID-19 severity, supported by the use of unsupervised machine learning with Topological Data Analysis. The study successfully elucidated significant differences between countries with low and high COVID-19 severity. We have detected microbiome signatures at the genus level which dominate the severity groups, as well as the influence of various confounding factors influencing this relationship. Microbiome composition varies significantly with geographical location, which is associated with a diverse range of diseases (Sun et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021; Romano et al., 2021). Overall, our results support the complex association between the gut microbiome and COVID-19 severity.

Additionally, as previous studies have demonstrated antiviral activity of specific probiotic strains in several respiratory viruses, including other coronaviruses and COVID-19, special attention should be paid to more targeted approaches (Baud et al., 2020; Bozkurt and Bilen, 2021b). The need for strain-level studies is supported by the finding that different strains of the same species can have differential effects on T cell differentiation López et al., 2011. This includes individual- and population-level studies at the strain level, as well as targeted case-control studies and RCTs. However, the largest effect of probiotics may be exerted when delivered as a public health intervention. As this study suggests, a more anti-inflammatory microbiome profile may be a contributor to fewer hospitalisations from COVID-19 - with effects not only for the individual but for the whole country. Less pressure on the healthcare system could mean potentially fewer excess deaths due to cancelled routine appointments and planned surgeries as has been observed especially for cancer patients during the pandemic (Maringe et al., 2020; Riera et al., 2021). The microbiome is a particularly accessible treatment target for population-level interventions, as it can be modulated through oral supplements or diet. Similar to how foods, such as flour and salt, and other products, such as toothpaste, have been fortified to successfully prevent birth defects (Brown et al., 2011), iodine deficiency (Andersson et al., 2010), and caries (Twetman et al., 2003), respectively, such everyday products could be fortified to improve the microbiome.

The findings of this study suggest an association between the microbiome of country populations at baseline and the severity of COVID-19 experienced during the pandemic, as measured by hospitalisations. Specifically, anti-inflammatory bacterial taxa including Bifidobacteria and Eubacterium rectale were identified as protective. We also find evidence that characteristics of countries, such as the proportion of over 70-year-olds, as well as GDP and Human Development Index, influence this association between the microbiome and COVID-19 severity. Future studies should aim to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of wealth, policy, and population characteristics on the microbiome and on hospitalisations. These findings were made possible by a unique study design of indirect association using open-access population-level data. As our findings both support and expand upon individual-level findings, this study highlights the unique capabilities of such population-level studies for understanding diseases and finding novel treatment avenues, especially when considering the microbiome which is a particularly accessible target. Finally, the use of an unsupervised machine learning tool, Topological Data Analysis, strengthened and expanded findings from conventional microbiome analysis, particularly through its ability to account for nonlinear relationships and the effect of confounders. This validates TDA as a valuable tool for microbiome analysis, particularly for microbiome-disease associations.
