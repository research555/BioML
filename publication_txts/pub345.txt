Correlation Between the Gut Microbiome and Immunotherapy Response in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review of the Literature

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease associated with dysbiosis within the gastrointestinal tract. Characteristic taxonomic shifts of microbial populations are observed in disease progression and remission; however, despite similarities, there are many differences among individuals presenting with IBD including IBD subset, clinical course, and response to therapy. Much is still unknown about how these taxonomic shifts interact with immunotherapy and how genetic variants contribute. In this systematic review, we aimed to compile information on the interactions of the gut microbiome with immunotherapy in the course of disease and treatment of IBD patients. This systematic review was conducted as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the PubMed database was methodically screened for literature search including keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms for relevant articles.

The quality appraisal was completed using the Cochrane Tool, Newcastle-Ottawa checklist, and the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) checklist, as appropriate, and 11 relevant articles were included in this systematic review. Our review concludes that although there are characteristic taxonomic shifts between diseased and healthy patients, genetic variants are an important consideration in the predictive quality of disease and treatment decisions. The comparison between interactions of microbial populations and treatment in addition to the role of genetic variants may provide insight into treatment non-responders. Due to our limitations in current knowledge including the complexity of the microcosm, ethnic genetic variations among human populations, and our focus on relevant articles published in English over the past six years, we may have missed relevant studies. Future studies should focus on the comparison between Western and other cultural populations as well as further implementation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in clinical predictability.

One of the major functional components of the gastrointestinal system is the delicately balanced microbiota within it. Dysbiosis, the unfavorable alteration of this commensal, is linked to several human pathologies [1,2]. This imbalance has been implicated in chronic inflammation, including autoimmune disease in the form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [3]. The two subsets of IBD are different in that ulcerative colitis (UC) continuously affects the large intestine and rectum with epithelial inflammation and superficial ulcers, while Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) unevenly affects both the large and small intestines with full-thickness ulceration [3,4]. The understanding of the microbiome and its role in human health largely still lacks elucidation, however, the use of innovative technologies is improving our understanding [5]. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified novel genetic variants associated with differing traits such as early-onset CD (CTLA-4) [6,7].

The gut microbiome is seemingly involved in more than macromolecular digestion, as the pathogenic role of dysbiotic inflammation has been linked to other comorbidities such as mental illness, including depression [23,24]. Inflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins such as interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated through meta-analysis showing an increased incidence of depressive symptoms [23]. Co-morbid depressive symptoms predict poor disease course in IBD and are inconsistently improved by psychological treatments, inferring that disease progression including co-morbid depression may stem from the effects of treatment on gut flora [23,25]. Immunomodulators have shown meaningful changes in microflora populations with clinical improvement but more needs to be done to understand the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the gut microbiome to explain why these treatments may work in some patients but remain ineffective or partially effective in other patients. This systematic review explores the current literature on the association between immunotherapy and the microbiome of IBD patients.

Methods

There are some limitations to this study as only work published in the English language in the past six years involving human subjects was evaluated. We may have missed studies published in other languages outside of this time frame, which may impact the data available to us. Both the genetic constitution and dietary habits of the human population have been shown to impact the development of IBD and gut microbial communities, therefore, we may have missed other valuable studies published in different languages which may assess this topic in different cultural populations. This study focused on the involvement of human subjects, however, exclusively animal models not included here may provide further insight into disease process and treatment.

In this systematic review, we aimed to compile information on the interactions of the gut microbiome with immunotherapy in the course of disease and treatment of IBD patients. After thoroughly reviewing the studies, we found that although there are characteristic taxonomic shifts between diseased and healthy patients, genetic variants are an important consideration in the predictive quality of disease and treatment decisions. Despite genetic and dietary factors, the characteristic shifts in microbial populations were similar among the studied Asian and Western groups. Furthermore, the bioavailability of some treatments may be impacted by existing intestinal microbes; while intestinal microbial populations may change directly or indirectly in the course of treatment.

The juxtaposition between the interaction of microbial populations and treatment in addition to the existence of genetic variants may provide insight into why some patients do not respond fully to therapy. We believe that further categorization of microbial changes between diseased and healthy states will improve our therapeutic potential and prevention of both gastrointestinal and multi-system diseases. Limitations in our current knowledge including the non-bacterial components of the gut microcosm and the complexity of both the metagenomic gut composition and genetic variants of IBD need further clarity to improve our clinical predictive tools. Our study is necessary for furthering the need for specific characterization of microbial changes in IBD processes and treatment. Future studies should focus on the comparison between Western and other cultural populations as well as further implementation of GWAS in clinical predictability.
