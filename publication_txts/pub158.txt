Next steps after 15 stimulating years of human gut microbiome research

Gut microbiome research has bloomed over the past 15 years. We have learnt a lot about the complex microbial communities that colonize our intestine. Promising avenues of research and microbiome‐based applications are being implemented, with the goal of sustaining host health and applying personalized disease management strategies. Despite this exciting outlook, many fundamental questions about enteric microbial ecosystems remain to be answered. Organizational measures will also need to be taken to optimize the outcome of discoveries happening at an extremely rapid pace. This article highlights our own view of the field and perspectives for the next 15 years.

Gut microbiome research has bloomed over the past 15 years. However, many fundamental questions about enteric microbial ecosystems remain to be answered. This article highlights our own view of the field and perspectives for the next 15 years.

The study of commensal microbial populations in the intestine of humans and other animals started to draw attention already in the 1960s, including the role of gut microbes in host health using gnotobiotic animal models (Dubos and Schaedler, 1960; Savage and Dubos, 1968). After discovery of the 16S rRNA molecule in the 1980s (Woese et al., 1980) and the advent of high‐throughput sequencing methods in the 2000s (Weinstock, 2012), gut microbiomes gained a lot of attention again during the last 2 decades. After all, these microscopic organisms influence our health and the development of infectious and chronic diseases, which is of interest to anyone (Wilkinson et al., 2021). Research projects on gut microbiomes have reached unprecedented scales, for example, archives of microbial diversity around the globe and sequencing one million of human metagenomes. Microbiome research is heading towards a bright future! In 15 years from now, molecular analysis of microbiomes will be implemented in clinical routines to help diagnose diseases and develop personalized pharmaceutical and nutritional therapies. All intestinal microbes (prokaryotes, fungi, viruses) and their niches in the gut will be known, and therapies based on customized synthetic communities will be possible. The way to this ideal scenario is, however, steep and with serpentines (Box 1). In other words, several fundamental steps must be taken prior to reaching this goal, some of which are detailed in the next sections (Fig. 1).

Cultivation‐free approaches have refashioned microbiome research and became first available to many researchers worldwide when high‐throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing started to be affordable in 2007–2010 (Hamady and Knight, 2009). Nowadays, shotgun metagenomics is standard for accurate profiling of gut microbiomes (Quince et al., 2017), especially when analysing stool (the processing of mucosal samples is more challenging). Efficient taxonomic and functional profilers as well as assembly based approaches for metagenomics have been developed (Segata et al., 2012; Li et al., 2015; Nurk et al., 2017; Kang et al., 2019; Milanese et al., 2019; Beghini et al., 2021), which have permitted to achieve remarkable results already: the identification of disease‐ and condition‐associated biomarkers in very large datasets (Zeevi et al., 2015; Lloyd‐Price et al., 2019; Thomas et al., 2019; Asnicar et al., 2021); the characterization of single microbial strains showing that the gut microbiome of each individual is unique (Schloissnig et al., 2013; Franzosa et al., 2015; Truong et al., 2017; Van Rossum et al., 2020); the assessment of microbial transmission from mothers to infants during the first phases of life (Koenig et al., 2011; Ferretti et al., 2018; Korpela et al., 2018; Laursen et al., 2021; Walter and Hornef, 2021); the observation of thousands of yet‐uncultured and previously neglected microbial species (Almeida et al., 2019; Nayfach et al., 2019; Pasolli et al., 2019). However, as standardized sample preparation protocols are now available and latest cutting‐edge technologies enable sequencing at a depth of 5–10 GB for ca. USD 100 (for projects involving at least a few hundred samples), the bottleneck is now the computation of raw sequencing data and downstream interpretation (Quince et al., 2017).

New technical breakthroughs are to be expected within the next 15 years, but their paths are difficult to predict. Long‐read and portable sequencing approaches are already being implemented (Tedersoo et al., 2021). If the field turns towards intensive use of such technologies, computational tools will need to be completely rethought. Moreover, when other omics (metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics and metabolomics) reach the popularity and standardization of metagenomics, they will enable a much deeper understanding of gut microbial functions, but new analytical strategies for multi‐omics data integration will be needed. It is also very likely that single‐cell technologies become more effective in surveying thousands of strains within any given microbiome, opening completely new venues in the molecular understanding of microbiomes (Hatzenpichler et al., 2020). All in all, the promise of microbiome‐based personalized medicine will come true only if future technological developments are coupled with substantial advances in the computational and quantitative fields (e.g. statistics).

Human gut microbiome research already offers so many promises for the near future; what would it be if the ecosystem were fully characterized! Many gut bacteria are still unknown, not to mention interactions between them. For the ones that have been cultured or we know exist, so many genes are still of unknown function or fully uncharacterized. This weakens the power of multi‐omics approaches substantially due to low annotation rates. Estimates about the cultured fraction of gut microbiomes vary depending on studies (e.g. the host species considered, and the method used for estimation). In short, we can cultivate more than a minority (30–60% of sequence‐based diversity) (Thomas and Segata, 2019; Hitch et al., 2021a), but a lot of work is still ahead of us. Similar to gnotobiology, pioneering anaerobic cultivation studies date back from the 1960s (Attebery and Finegold, 1969; Moore and Holdeman, 1974). However, methods of identification have greatly improved, and so many isolates have been lost over the decades due to local storage only (see the section below about ‘Infrastructural needs’). The field has now realized the need to use again anaerobic cultivation to obtain isolates; projects on the gut microbiome from different host species have been published and more are ongoing (Lagkouvardos et al., 2016; Seshadri et al., 2018; Forster et al., 2019; Zou et al., 2019; Wylensek et al., 2020; Groussin et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021).

Finally, while bacteria have attracted most of the attention because they are dominant members of gut microbial communities, other microbes will need to be studied more intensively to obtain a less biased view of microbe‐host interactions. For instance, archaea (e.g. methanogens) are also important ecosystem members, the diversity of which is still incomplete (Borrel et al., 2020; Youngblut et al., 2021). The role of fungi has also been highlighted (Bacher et al., 2019; Lemoinne et al., 2020; van Tilburg Bernardes et al., 2020). The most difficult task will be to comprehensively assess the diversity of host‐associated viromes (Virgin, 2014; Moreno‐Gallego et al., 2019). Among viruses, those preying on bacteria, that is, bacteriophages (or briefly phages), are of particular interest due to (i) their role as regulators of microbial communities (Shkoporov and Hill, 2019; Fujimoto et al., 2020; Lourenco et al., 2020; Spriewald et al., 2020), and (ii) their potential clinical use, particularly against multi‐drug resistant (MDR) bacteria (further detailed below in the section ‘Clinical microbiome‐based applications’). As in the case of bacteria, the majority of phages in the human gut have not yet been isolated. For instance in contrast to the wealth of knowledge about double‐stranded (ds) DNA‐phages, which numerically dominate phage collections and genomic databases, very few (+) single‐stranded (ss) RNA‐phages have been isolated and there is a complete absence of (−) ssRNA‐phages. This contrasts with the high diversity of RNA phages observed by metagenomics (Krishnamurthy et al., 2016; Callanan et al., 2020). A future challenge will be to decipher the specific environmental conditions that favour RNA‐ over dsDNA‐phages for the same host. Oxygen could be one major driver, as many phages may have adapted to the anaerobic lifestyle of their host in the intestine (Hernandez and Vives, 2020). Anaerobic culture conditions have so far not been extensively used for the isolation of gut‐derived phages (Hodges et al., 2021).

Disease‐associated disturbances in gut microbiomes have very often been expressed at the level of genera and higher taxonomic levels. This contrasts with the fact that multiple strains of a given species can drastically differ functionally (Karcher et al., 2020; Sorbara et al., 2020), albeit this is not a universal rule. It is thus obvious that common methods to characterize gut microbiomes at the molecular level must aim towards a higher resolution. Shotgun metagenomic approaches already allow precise strain‐level analyses (Karcher et al., 2020; Van Rossum et al., 2020; Hildebrand, 2021). Soon, full‐length, high‐throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing combined with sequence variant analysis will do as well (Karst et al., 2021), although this works only for certain taxonomic groups. Nonetheless, it will take a while until workflows are fined‐tuned and the expertise spreads to end‐users. High‐quality, habitat‐specific atlas of molecular microbial diversity will be very helpful to help interpreting data at the strain level (Almeida et al., 2021). Moreover, landmark‐studies assessing the precision of bioinformatic tools used to establish strain‐level metagenomic catalogues will have to be performed using mock communities of realistic complexity (Meziti et al., 2021). Also, the extent to which all the sequence‐based strain diversity reported translates into functional differences of relevance for the ecosystem will have to be clarified.

Finally, easily implementable protocols that allow tailored genetic manipulation of a wide variety of anaerobic gut commensals are also direly needed and will generate further breakthroughs in microbiome research (Lim et al., 2017; Whitaker et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2019; Ramachandran and Bikard, 2019). Being able to knockout‐specific genes in their native host is an obstacle that prevents proof‐of‐concept studies on the role of microbial functions in host health. For strain‐specific, targeted gene manipulations within bacterial communities, bio‐engineered phages equipped with gene‐editing modules (e.g. CRISPR‐Cas) will likely become a very useful toolbox (Yosef et al., 2017; Tagliaferri et al., 2020). Advances in synthetic biology will also certainly help investigating yet‐unknown gut microbial functions observed by metagenomics (McCarty and Ledesma‐Amaro, 2019).

The physiology of nearly all human organs is influenced by gut microbes and their products (e.g. metabolites), fuelling the hopes of patients and physicians for novel treatment approaches with a significant clinical impact. The field needs to multiply efforts to reach practices that are up to the promises of microbiome‐based diagnostics and interventional strategies using or targeting the microbes themselves.

Considering the current antibiotic crisis, phage treatments have re‐gained much interest in the past 15 years, and they can also be used experimentally to modulate complex microbial communities. However, while clinicians and surgeons long for rapid official approval to help fighting deadly infections (Moelling et al., 2018), regulatory and legal bodies are slow, explaining the ever‐growing number of compassionate phage therapies (McCallin et al., 2019). Besides natural phages, those developed by genome engineering and forward genetics (Dedrick et al., 2019) will facilitate efficient and safe use in clinical settings. Phage engineering will leverage research and applications towards tailored modulation of the gut microbiota, which represents a major reservoir of MDR (Hsu et al., 2020; Tavella et al., 2021). We are already capable of constructing hybrid phage particles with a standard genomic backbone coupled with exchangeable tail fibres to be able to transduce any bacterial host (Yosef et al., 2017; Yehl et al., 2019). Further development of this technology in coming years will allow functional re‐programming of selected bacteria in the gut. Although phages are highly (bacterial) host‐specific, cascading events on other microbial community members affecting metabolomes and eventually (mammalian) host functions can occur (Hsu et al., 2019). A paradigm shift is at the front door: phages can directly interact with mammalian cells (Bichet et al., 2021; Bodner et al., 2021). Hence, future research and applications will need to integrate this tripartite system by investigating long‐term co‐existence and evolution of phages and bacteria and by exploring potential ‘off‐target’ effects of phages (Wahida et al., 2021).

In microbial ecosystems, diversity is usually a good attribute. Similarly, as any scientific method is somewhat biased in one way or the other, it is good to nurture a certain diversity in methods and ways to implement them in different labs. However, this is without doubts that gut microbiome research has been parasitized by artefact findings due to the misuse of methods and misinterpretation of data. As implied above, diversity is meaningful and strict harmonization must not be the goal to avoid that findings are all biased the same way. Nevertheless, initiatives that help generating high‐quality protocols via comprehensive comparisons of both wet‐lab and in silico procedures in microbiome research will continue being needed, from sampling to data analysis (Costea et al., 2017; Meyer et al., 2021). This should be accompanied by education efforts to spread the knowledge from expert labs to a broad spectrum of end‐users.

Importance of the availability and re‐use of materials is not restricted to molecular work. Future breakthroughs in microbiome research will come from the return to cultivation work and the use of isolates. However, infrastructural measures to help facilitating the archiving and accessibility of strains are badly needed. Programmes have been launched to collect and conserve existing diversity before it is lost (Bello et al., 2018; Rabesandratana, 2018). Such projects also help extend our horizon to populations outside the Western world to obtain a more comprehensive landscape of gut microbiome diversity. However, international collections of isolates are chronically underfunded considering the Hercules work of having to accommodate thousands of strains isolated worldwide, including the large‐scale projects mentioned above. This badly harms the field on a mid‐ to long‐term perspective and will require multi‐layer solutions (from funding agencies to scientific journals) as mentioned above for data management.

A lot has happened in the field of gut microbiome research during the last two decades. The journey has, however, only started. Some selected hot‐topics are present in Box 2. Promises are many in terms of potential applications, but expectations are correspondingly high. The field has gained a lot of attention, and it is now time to consolidate and deliver. An exciting time to be a microbiome scientist!
