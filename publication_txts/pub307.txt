Organ-level protein networks as a reference for the host effects of the microbiome

Connections between the microbiome and health are rapidly emerging in a wide range of diseases. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of how different microbial communities are influencing their hosts is often lacking. One method researchers have used to understand these effects are germ-free (GF) mouse models. Differences found within the organ systems of these model organisms may highlight generalizable mechanisms that microbiome dysbioses have throughout the host. Here, we applied multiplexed, quantitative proteomics on the brains, spleens, hearts, small intestines, and colons of conventionally raised and GF mice, identifying associations to colonization state in over 7000 proteins. Highly ranked associations were constructed into protein–protein interaction networks and visualized onto an interactive 3D mouse model for user-guided exploration. These results act as a resource for microbiome researchers hoping to identify host effects of microbiome colonization on a given organ of interest. Our results include validation of previously reported effects in xenobiotic metabolism, the innate immune system, and glutamate-associated proteins while simultaneously providing organism-wide context. We highlight organism-wide differences in mitochondrial proteins including consistent increases in NNT, a mitochondrial protein with essential roles in influencing levels of NADH and NADPH, in all analyzed organs of conventional mice. Our networks also reveal new associations for further exploration, including protease responses in the spleen, high-density lipoproteins in the heart, and glutamatergic signaling in the brain. In total, our study provides a resource for microbiome researchers through detailed tables and visualization of the protein-level effects of microbial colonization on several organ systems.

The gut microbiome is emerging as a critical component of human health. It has been shown that the microbial communities colonizing our bodies play important roles in the immune development of infants (Milani et al. 2017) and the regulation of the innate immune system (Thaiss et al. 2016). Further, a dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been correlated with many diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Sartor and Wu 2017), diabetes (Tilg and Moschen 2014), obesity (Bouter et al. 2017), cardiovascular disease (Ahmadmehrabi and Tang 2017), and mental health disorders (Nguyen et al. 2018). Microbial production or modification of metabolites such as bile acids, choline derivatives, vitamins, and lipids provide some insight into the underlying host-microbe interactions in these diseases (Nicholson et al. 2012). However, many mechanisms mediating these disease states remain unknown.

Here, we sought to further detail the protein effects of microbiota colonization occurring both inside and outside of the GI tract as a reference for microbiome researchers interested in a given host protein, organ system, or protein network. Associations of highly ranked proteins were constructed into protein–protein interaction networks for the brain, spleen, heart, small intestine, and colon, as well as a global network. While the brains and gastrointestinal tract of GF mice have been characterized in several studies, other organs such as the heart and spleen may be of interest given the emerging roles of the microbiota in atherosclerosis (Karlsson et al. 2012) and immune development (Chung et al. 2012). We hypothesized that applying methods for improved accuracy in quantitative proteomics (Ting et al. 2011) would further define the influence of the microbiota in each of these organs. With this, we hope to reveal microbiota-induced changes that could underlie disease states. Our results validate a body of literature in the field, provide visualization tools for contextualizing the organism-wide effects of microbial colonization, and identify several new host-microbiota associations for further investigation.

To determine the protein-level consequences of microbial colonization, three biological replicates of five different tissues (brain, small intestine, colon, spleen, heart) were analyzed from conventionally raised or GF mice. Multiplexed proteomic analysis of tissue homogenates resulted in the quantification of 7752 proteins overall, of which 4663 were quantified across all samples. These 4663 proteins were used for downstream analysis. A separate pilot study of the brain tissue resulted in the quantification of 6203 proteins.

Colonization state of the mouse appeared to have larger impacts on organs in direct contact with the gut microbiota, namely, the small intestine and colon. The GI organs analyzed had an average of 210 proteins associated with colonization state while the three organs outside of the GI tract averaged 52. The brain yielded the lowest number of associated proteins with only 22. GI tract organs also displayed a higher percentage of interconnectivity, with an average of 71% of associated proteins within GI organs having a moderate-confidence connection to another associated protein within the organ, while organs outside the GI tract averaged 39% (Fig. 1). We hypothesize that the interconnectivity and number of associations with colonization is related to the direct contact of GI organs with microbiota. However, it is possible that including a higher portion of intestinal tissue may have influenced these results.

Our networks provided support for previously reported broad-scale effects on GI organs, as well as abundance shifts from specific transcripts or proteins. As shown in a previous proteomic study (Lichtman et al. 2016), the small intestine and colon displayed distinct changes as a result of microbial colonization. One example of this was the larger portion of proteins associated with GF status within the small intestine (66%) than in the colon (42%) (Fig. 1).

Other studies identified similar results at a pathway and individual protein level. After a literature search for protein or transcript differences within GF models, we identified seven publications with related findings (Supplemental Table S3). In brief, changes in xenobiotic metabolism were reported in the GI, liver, and kidney, both at the transcriptional level (Fu et al. 2017) and the protein level (Kuno et al. 2016). Our networks also highlighted changes in glutamate-related proteins which were previously reported at the transcriptional level (El Aidy et al. 2013). We also report the regulation of innate immune proteins including the antimicrobial peptide REG3G (Larsson et al. 2012) and the regulation of NNT (Mardinoglu et al. 2015), which will be discussed further below.

Functional enrichment analysis of GI tract organs resulted in stronger and more diverse associations with colonization status than organs outside the GI tract. Several enrichments emerged with potential links to redox shifts in the small intestine. These included disulfide bonds, oxidoreductase activity, NADP, and xenobiotic metabolism through cytochrome P450s (Figs. 2,
3). Functional differences in the colon highlighted pancreatic secretion, immunoglobulins, proteins of the heat shock protein 70 family, digestion, and stress as the functions increased in conventional mice (Figs. 2,
3). GF colons had enrichments for transporter activity, Calycin, fatty-acid binding, metalloproteases, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling (Fig. 2). Together, these results may indicate stress response as an important factor mediating host-microbiota interactions in the colon and redox states influencing interactions of the small intestine.

The networks associated with the brain and the heart displayed fewer interconnected proteins. Only 34% and 27% of proteins had a connection within the heart network and brain network, respectively. However, a group of primarily GF-associated proteins that included APOA1 and APOE was found among the heart proteins (Fig. 1). These results may suggest changes in lipid profiles in the heart: increased high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and chylomicrons in GF compared to conventional mice. The brain showed limited functional enrichments (Supplemental Table S2). However, both RASGRF1 and RASGRF2 were increased among conventional mice. These proteins may be of interest given implications in glutamatergic excitatory synaptic signaling and in facilitating long-term potentiation leading to enhanced memory, learning, and synaptic plasticity (Drake et al. 2011; Schwechter et al. 2013).

One prominent finding from our generalized network was a significant increase in NNT in all conventional tissues. This protein is a key regulator of generalized biosynthetic processes and is related to glutamate synthesis (Mardinoglu et al. 2015). Statistically, NNT was among the strongest relationships found within all organs analyzed (π = 3.8, 4, 2.3, 7, and 3.7 for small intestine, colon, spleen, heart, and brain, respectively). We also identified subnetworks related to mitochondrial glutamate metabolism and mitochondrial respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase, with most of the related proteins down-regulated in the small intestine of conventional mice (Fig. 3). In addition, proteins relating to the mitochondrial reduction of glutathione, GLUD1, and GLS had confirmed associations with previous transcriptomic analysis (Supplemental Table S3). While this subnetwork was largely derived from small intestine proteins, there was evidence that this system may also be affected in the brain through AMT, which is involved in the mitochondrial metabolism of glycine.

Next, we assessed the 150 top- and bottom-ranked proteins associated with GF status from the multinomial regression and created a protein–protein interaction network (Fig. 4C). Of interest was a cluster of proteins related to redox states in mitochondria. Several proteins including ECSIT, NDUFS4, NUBPL, NDUFA11, NDUFB6, NDUFA8, and ATPAF1 are all related to mitochondrial complex 1 of the electron transport chain. Other evidence of the organism-wide impact of microbial colonization on mitochondria included shifts in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS23, MRPL50, MRPS17, MRPL49, and MRPL17) and proteins related to mitochondrial heat shock response (HSPD1, HSPE1, SOD2, LONP1). The data presented here suggest that microbial colonization may have organismal-level impacts on mitochondrial function.

To encourage user interaction with our data, we created a web-based display of our results projected onto a 3D model of a mouse. This interactive display allows for user-guided exploration of the protein and pathway-level associations with colonization status. To access the model, users should access the ‘ili web server (https://ili.embl.de/), then drag-and-drop the provided texturization file (Supplemental File S1) and a supplemental table for either the proteins (Supplemental Table S4) or pathways (Supplemental Table S5) identified in this study. With this tool, users can search for proteins and pathways of interest and project the association scores onto all the organs analyzed in this study.

The pathway-level visualizations help to summarize and explore the gene set enrichment analyses. On a per-organ basis, an association with conventional or GF status for each functional category was calculated by comparing the statistical strength of gene set enrichments (Supplemental Table S2). These association scores have been summarized in an ‘ili-compatible file in Supplemental Table S5. Pathway association scores ranged from 12.90 (highly associated with conventional status) to −7.25 (highly associated with GF status). We demonstrate the use of this tool to visualize the associations with “Oxidoreductase” in Figure 5B.

Our multiorgan analysis was utilized to generate protein interaction maps and 3D visualization tools that researchers can use to understand organ-specific and organism-wide changes that may underlie host-microbiome interactions. From our networks, we can identify common themes found from previous analyses of GF tissue. For example, we found changes in innate and adaptive immune responses to microbial colonization (Larsson et al. 2012), changes in the glutamine and glutamate pathway (El Aidy et al. 2013; Mardinoglu et al. 2015), and changes in xenobiotic degradation pathways (Kuno et al. 2016; Fu et al. 2017; Kindt et al. 2018). This study contributes to the field by moving toward an organism-wide understanding of host-microbiome interactions. Here, we incorporate new statistical and visualization tools for multiorgan analysis and include understudied organs from outside of the GI tract. As roles for the microbiome are expanding into immunity (Thaiss et al. 2016), cardiovascular disease (Ahmadmehrabi and Tang 2017), and mental health disorders (Nguyen et al. 2018), defining the influence of the microbiome on these tissues may be of importance. Indeed, our networks provided several putative organism-level roles for the microbiome.

There are likely many unknown mechanisms mediating host-microbiota interactions. Our detailed maps and visualization tools for understanding the organ-level impacts of microbial colonization give insight into the unique and common protein-level changes occurring throughout mice. These networks suggest changes throughout the mice related to mitochondrial dysfunction and redox states. Though fewer changes were found in organs apart from the GI tract, our protein networks of the spleen, brain, and heart may provide insight for researchers establishing connections between the microbiota and diseases related to these organ systems. We hope these networks and visualization tools may be useful in the microbiome research community to help dissect the specific effects that microbial communities have in a given organ system, protein, or protein network of interest. In total, we view our study as a step toward better understanding the role of the microbiota in health and disease.

Three male GF C57BL/6 mice were kept under GF conditions in a Park Bioservices isolator in Georgia State University's (GSU's) GF facility, and three male conventional C57BL/6 were kept in regular housing at GSU's animal facility. At 5 mo of age, mice were euthanized and organs were collected followed by immediate snap-freezing. All mice were bred and housed at Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, under institutionally approved protocols (IACUC # A14033).

All organ proteome methods were performed as previously described (Lapek et al. 2018). Snap-frozen organs (stored at −80°C beforehand) were suspended in PBS and homogenized using a Mini BeadBeater (Biospec). Our final analysis contained three biological replicates of each colonization condition per organ, and no technical replicates were collected given strong correlation observed between biological replicates in our past work (Lapek et al. 2018). Organ homogenates were lysed in 1 mL of buffer composed of 75 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich), 3% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 mM NaF (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM beta-glycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Sigma-Aldrich), and Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitors (1 tablet per 10 mL, Roche) in 50 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 8.5 (Villén and Gygi 2008). To ensure full lysis, homogenates were passed through a 21-gauge syringe 20 times. Insoluble debris was then pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 rpm. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and an equal volume of 8 M urea in 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.5 was added to each sample. Samples were then vortexed and further lysed through two 10-sec intervals of probe sonication at 25% amplitude.

Peptides were labeled with 10-plex TMT reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (Thompson et al. 2003; McAlister et al. 2014) as previously described (Wang et al. 2011a). TMT reagents were reconstituted in dry acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich) at 20 µg/µL. Dried peptides were resuspended in 30% dry acetonitrile in 200 mM HEPES, pH 8.5, and 7 µL of the appropriate TMT reagent was added to peptides. Reagents 126 and 131 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used to label peptide aliquots composed of an equal concentration of every sample within all mass spectrometry (MS) runs. These composite samples acted as a reference within all mass spectrometry runs for data normalization purposes described later. Remaining reagents were used to label samples in random order with no bias regarding animal of origin, organ, or colonization status. This randomization was performed to prevent known batch-effects in mass spectrometry experiments (Brenes et al. 2019). The brain samples were analyzed as a pilot experiment before the other organs. For brains, all procedures were performed as above, though the TMT experiment was separate from other organs. Within the brain TMT experiment, one channel, 129C, consisted of a 50-µg average of all peptides from brain samples. Labeling was carried out for 1 h at room temperature and was quenched by adding 8 µL of 5% hydroxylamine (Sigma-Aldrich). TMT-labeled peptides from each of the organ samples were acidified by adding 50 µL of 1% TFA and subsequently combined into a composite sample per TMT 10-plex experiment. During the pilot experiment with the brains, the pooled samples were desalted and fractionated using a Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) per the manufacturer's instructions. For the larger study, samples were pooled per 10-plex experiment, desalted with C18 Sep-Paks, and further fractionated as described below.

Data acquisition methods were performed as previously described (Lapek et al. 2018). Sample fractionation, excluding the brain experiment, was performed by basic pH reverse-phase liquid chromatography with concatenated fractions as previously described (Wang et al. 2011a). Briefly, samples were resuspended in 5% formic acid/5% acetonitrile and separated over a 4.6 mm × 250 mm C18 column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on an Ultimate 3000 HPLC fitted with a fraction collector, degasser, and variable wavelength detector. The separation was performed over a 22% to 35%, 60-min linear gradient of acetonitrile in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 0.5 mL/min. The resulting 96 fractions were combined as previously described (Wang et al. 2011a). All fractions were dried under vacuum and resuspended in 5% formic acid/5% acetonitrile and analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC)-MS2/MS3 for identification and quantitation.

MS3 analysis was performed using synchronous precursor selection (SPS) enabled to maximize TMT quantitation sensitivity (McAlister et al. 2014). A maximum of 10 MS2 precursors was specified for the SPS setting, which were simultaneously isolated and fragmented for MS3 analysis. Higher-Energy Collisional Dissociation fragmentation was used for MS3 analysis with a normalized collision energy of 55%. Resultant fragment ions (MS3) were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000 with a low mass cut-off of 110 m/z. AGC for MS3 spectra was set to 1 × 105 with a maximum ion injection time of 100 ms. Centroided data were collected, and MS2 ions between the range of 40 m/z below and 15 m/z above the precursor m/z were excluded by SPS.

Data were processed using Proteome Discover 2.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS2 data were searched against UniProt mouse databases (downloaded 7/2/2018 and 5/11/2017 for the brain analysis and other organs, respectively) using the SEQUEST algorithm (Eng et al. 1994). A decoy search was also conducted with sequences in reverse order (Peng et al. 2003; Elias et al. 2005; Elias and Gygi 2007). A precursor mass tolerance of 50 ppm (Beausoleil et al. 2006; Huttlin et al. 2010) was specified and 0.6 Da tolerance for MS2 fragments. Static modification of TMT 10-plex tags on lysine and peptide n-termini (+229.162932 Da) and carbamidomethylation of cysteines (+57.02146 Da) were specified. Variable oxidation of methionine (+15.99492 Da) was also included in search parameters. Data were filtered to 1% peptide and protein level false discovery rates with the target-decoy strategy through Percolator (Käll et al. 2007; Spivak et al. 2009).

TMT reporter ion intensities were extracted from MS3 spectra for quantitative analysis, and signal-to-noise values were used for quantitation. Spectra were filtered and summed as previously described (Lapek et al. 2017b). Data were normalized in a multistep process, whereby they were first normalized to the pooled standards (TMT-126 and -131) for each protein and then to the median signal across the pooled standards from all experiments (Lapek et al. 2017a). An average of these normalizations was used for the next step. As the brain samples did not contain a composite bridge channel for normalization, raw signal/noise ratios were normalized by the average signal of the given protein divided by the median of all protein averages. To account for slight differences in amounts of protein labeled, these values were then normalized to the median of the entire data set and reported as final normalized summed signal-to-noise ratios per protein per sample.

Bioinformatic analysis was performed in Python (version 3.5.1), and records are available online in Jupyter Notebooks (https://github.com/rhmills/Germ-free-organ-proteomics). To prevent statistical artifacts generated due to the various methods of dealing with missing values, only proteins with quantification in all samples were used. A Student's t-test with unequal variance was performed through the package, SciPy (https://www.scipy.org). For ranking purposes, we evaluated associations with colonization state through π-score, which accounts for both fold-change and P-value (Xiao et al. 2014). A statistical cutoff of |π| > 1 was chosen based on previous work (Tran et al. 2019). This statistical measure corresponds to a significance level of α ∼ 0.05 and allowed for moderate stringency while including an adequate number of proteins for protein network construction and functional enrichment analysis.

Songbird (Morton et al. 2019) was used to implement the multinomial regression analysis with organ, mouse, and colonization status used in the regression formula. Model parameters were as follows: 10,000 epochs, batch size of 5, differential prior of 1.0, learning rate of 0.001, gradient clipping size of 10, and proteins with >5 counts were included. As the brain tissue was processed as an independent pilot study, we could not include this data as part of the multinomial regression analysis given the independent normalization used in each experiment.

The 3D mouse model was generated as described previously (Quinn et al. 2019). In brief, MRI images were acquired at the UCSD Center for Functional MRI from a euthanized 8-wk-old female C57BL/6 mouse with a Bruker 7T/20 MRI scanner using a quadrature birdcage transceiver. MRI parameters were as follows: 3D FLASH protocol with TE/TR = 6 ms/15 ms and matrix size 128 × 64 × 156, field of view prescribed to match the body size. InVesalius (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-27857-5_5) was used to trace individual organs in each MRI slice to generate the 3D model. The model was then processed with Blender (https://www.blender.org/) for smoothing.

Pathway-level association scores were determined by comparing the −Log10(Benjamini–Hochberg corrected P-values) for each functional enrichment in Supplemental Table S2. The statistical strength of the functional enrichment in GF tissue was subtracted from the statistical strength of the functional enrichment in conventional tissue. The following formula summarizes the calculation:
