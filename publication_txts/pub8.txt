Demystifying the manipulation of host immunity, metabolism, and extraintestinal tumors by the gut microbiome

The trillions of microorganisms in the gut microbiome have attracted much attention recently owing to their sophisticated and widespread impacts on numerous aspects of host pathophysiology. Remarkable progress in large-scale sequencing and mass spectrometry has increased our understanding of the influence of the microbiome and/or its metabolites on the onset and progression of extraintestinal cancers and the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Given the plasticity in microbial composition and function, microbial-based therapeutic interventions, including dietary modulation, prebiotics, and probiotics, as well as fecal microbial transplantation, potentially permit the development of novel strategies for cancer therapy to improve clinical outcomes. Herein, we summarize the latest evidence on the involvement of the gut microbiome in host immunity and metabolism, the effects of the microbiome on extraintestinal cancers and the immune response, and strategies to modulate the gut microbiome, and we discuss ongoing studies and future areas of research that deserve focused research efforts.

The gut microbiome (and its collective genomes, namely, the microbiome) is composed of trillions of bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, and other microeukaryotic colonizers.1 It is estimated that 3 × 1013 bacteria reside in the human gut, which is close to the number of cells in the human body.2 Four primary microbial phyla, including Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, comprise 98% of the gut microbiome in healthy adults, of which Firmicutes (60–80%) and Bacteroides (15–25%) are the dominant bacterial species. The diversity and density of microbial species increases longitudinally from the stomach to the colon, where the microbiome community (over 1013 microbial cells) is the most abundant and metabolically exuberant.3 Shockingly, the human microbiome contains over 3 million genes,4 a staggering number, especially when one considers that there are only 20,000–25,000 genes in the human genome.5 Approximately 60–80% of the gut microbiome cannot be cultivated under laboratory conditions; thus, much of the genome sequences of these species remain unknown. One of the culture-independent approaches is the reestablishment of metagenome-assembled genomes from human gut microbiomes, which has identified ~2500 previously unknown species and increased the diversity of the known bacterial repertoire to more than 4500 species.6 Another study used a similar research method to identify nearly 2000 uncultured candidate bacterial species, substantially increasing the bacterial phylogenetic diversity.7 Additionally, over 7000 microbial genomic structural variants (SVs) have been identified thus far in the human gut microbiome, and they have shown an association with disease risk factors. For example, a variant region in Anaerostipes hadrus encodes the biosynthesis of butyrate to decrease the risk of metabolic disease in the host, potentially explaining the difference in body weight between individuals carrying such microbial SVs and those who do not.8

The mammalian intestine serves as a fertile ground where host–microbiota interactions occur. The gut commensals that establish harmonious relationships with the host are essential for the development and appropriate function of the immune system via metabolite-independent mechanisms. The gut microbiome is an effective stimulator of the immune response in the gut.36,37 However, environmental exposure and genetic deficits in combination with gut dysbiosis potentially contribute to the manifestation of host immunity disorders and various inflammatory diseases.38–40 Correspondingly, immune signals induced by the gut microbiome in turn function as a powerful weapon to modulate gut commensals41,42 and to protect against pathogen invasion.43 It is essential to understand the perplexing and reciprocal interaction between the gut microbiome and host immune system, especially effects on the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Treg cells), T helper 17 (Th17) cells, and T helper 1 (Th1) cells that account for the majority of effector T (Teff) cells in the gut and immunoglobulin A (IgA)-producing B cells, as well as group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s).

Certain intestinal anaerobic bacteria, specifically the members of the Clostridium genus, such as cluster IV (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii44) and cluster XIVa (Anaerostipes butyraticus45 and Roseburia intestinalis,46) harbor the capability to convert indigestible carbohydrates into fermentation products, including SCFAs (particularly acetate, propionate, and butyrate).47 The concentration of SCFAs varies longitudinally in the intestine, with a peak level in the cecum and proximal colon.48

SCFAs (especially butyrate) can be absorbed into colonocytes via passive transport, SLC5A8-dependent transit, or the recognition of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs or GPRs) to function as energy sources.48 They are also transferred through the portal vein to the liver, and a residual amount that is unextracted and unmetabolized by the liver reaches the systemic circulation to regulate peripheral organs.48 Below, we unveil the intricate and dynamic interaction among SCFAs, the host immune system, and metabolism, which is instrumental in ameliorating the corresponding deficits and contributing to host homeostasis (Supplementary Table 1).

SCFAs can act on various immune cells in the gut to inhibit inflammation through multiple mechanisms (Fig.
1). The differentiation of anti-inflammatory forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3)+ Treg cells can be modulated by SCFAs.49 Initially, by acting through GPR43 (also known as free fatty acid receptor 2, FFAR2), propionate stimulates interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing Foxp3+ Treg cell differentiation and thus protects against experimental colitis.50,51 SCFA-mediated GPR43 signaling also elicits NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the resulting IL-18 secretion to control barrier integrity52,53 and was recently revealed to protect against gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GvHD).54 Similarly, butyrate binds GPR109A on intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, fostering an IL-10-rich and class 1A aldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh1a)-rich environment, which boosts Treg cell development while inhibiting proinflammatory Th17 cell expansion.55 Second, butyrate is well recognized as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, and the suppressive effect of butyrate on HDAC occurs in part by tightly binding to Zn2+ in the active site of HDAC.56 Butyrate increases the acetylation of histone H3 at the Foxp3 promoter and at the enhancer conserved noncoding sequence 1 (CNS1), ultimately eliciting robust gene expression and functional maturation.57,58 Butyrate derived from commensal bacteria Clostridium exerts epigenetic control over transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), a process mediated by its HDAC-inhibitory activity and through transcription factor specific protein binding on the core promoter, which drives TGF-β1 expression in IECs and the subsequent convergence of Treg cells in the intestine.59 Moreover, TGF-β in conjunction with retinoic acid (RA) generated from Aldh1a2-expressing DCs facilitates the development of Foxp3+ Treg cells.60 Through this process, the Foxp3 gene intronic enhancer CNS1 is endowed with a combined location for the RA receptor, supporting RA-mediated Foxp3+ pTreg cell development.61 Furthermore, symbiont Bifidobacterium infantis (B. infantis) is sufficient to enhance the number of CD103+ DCs and potentiate their capability to generate RA in the gut.62 Further studies are required to address what additional intestinal cell types or transcription factors respond to SCFA-mediated HDAC-inhibitory activity to orchestrate intestinal immunity. Collectively, these results demonstrate the profound function of SCFAs in the development of Treg cells.

SCFAs act through multiple distinct mechanisms to modulate the activities of intestinal macrophages. For example, the suppressive effect of butyrate on HDAC3 drives anti-microbial gene expression, further boosting anti-microbial peptide (AMP) production, such as S100A8/A9/A12 and lysozyme, consequently bolstering enteropathogen clearance.73 Similarly, the exposure of bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages to n-butyrate abrogates the release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory cytokines, including nitric oxide (NO), IL-6, and IL-12, by enhancing acetylation of the promoter regions of these corresponding genes and reducing subsequent gene transcription.74 Additionally, treating colonic macrophages with butyrate decreases the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) protein.75 Butyrate triggers a metabolic shift in macrophages from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism, which is dependent on the upregulation of Arg1 expression75,76 and the inhibition of HDAC3 activity,73 thereby favoring macrophage polarization towards an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype.73,76 Conversely, antibiotic-mediated gut dysbiosis and SCFA depletion may facilitate the expansion of proinflammatory Th1 cells through the activation of proinflammatory macrophages, contributing to susceptibility to infection.75 These findings highlight that the SCFA-mediated anti-inflammatory function is partially dependent on M2 macrophages. However, whether these SCFA-mediated functional alterations in intestinal macrophages are GPR-dependent remain unclear.

IECs function as gatekeepers of the innate immune system and affect the intestinal microenvironment following the identification of and response to microbial-derived SCFA irritation (Fig.
2).77 SCFAs participate in regulating the colonic metabolic state to foster an intestinal environment conducive to commensals. Under gut homeostatic conditions, the butyrate-mediated activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ, nuclear receptor primarily synthesized in IECs) promotes the mitochondrial β-oxidation of SCFAs as well as oxidative phosphorylation in colonocytes, thereby maintaining a local hypoxic microenvironment. The obligate anaerobic SCFA-producing bacteria thrive while the overgrowth of facultative anaerobic enteric pathogens such as Escherichia coli (E. coli, a surrogate marker for dysbiosis) and Salmonella is suppressed in such conditions.78,79 Simultaneously, PPAR-γ activation suppresses Nos2 expression in IECs as well as the production of inducible NO synthase (an enzyme that produces NO) and nitrate (a crucial energy source for facultative anaerobic pathogens).80 Additionally, Bacteroides-derived propionate has been shown to confer colonization resistance to pathogens in a PPAR-γ-independent manner, suggesting the functional redundancy present in SCFAs. Indeed, propionate facilitates the cytoplasmic acidification of Salmonella and disrupts the intracellular pH homeostasis of pathogens, thereby limiting pathogen expansion.81 Indeed, the functional metabolic capabilities of certain commensals confer protection against pathogen infection, which is attributable to the intracellular acidification of pathogens mediated by SCFAs.82 High concentrations of SCFAs and the acidic environment reverse or counteract the competitive advantage that O2 and NO3 respiration provide to facultative anaerobes such as Enterobacteriaceae.82 Conversely, antibiotic treatment elicits gut dysbiosis and SCFA exhaustion, which further inhibits the PPAR-γ signaling pathway and induces metabolic reprogramming. This reprogramming shifts colonocytes towards anaerobic glycolysis and away from oxidative metabolism, which markedly elevates the levels of oxygen and nitrate as well as lactate in the gut lumen, thus driving Enterobacteriaceae expansion.78,83 Moreover, elevated levels of Salmonella (family Enterobacteriaceae) utilize virulence factors to induce neutrophil transepithelial migration, contributing to the depletion of Clostridia and diminished concentrations of SCFAs. This negative feedback loop creates an environment that is more conducive to pathogen colonization.79 These findings have unveiled a causal interplay between microbiota-derived SCFAs and metabolism in the gut epithelium, setting the stage for the development of microbial and metabolite-based drugs for clinical translation and, potentially, therapies targeting PPAR-γ.61

SCFAs have also emerged as an important regulator of a physio-chemical barrier to support the integrity of the gut mucosal barrier by stimulating AMPs and mucus generation by Paneth cells and goblet cells, respectively (Fig.
2).84 By acting through specific GPCRs, SCFAs potentially activate NLRP6 to facilitate intestinal goblet cells to secrete Mucin2.85–87 Clostridia-derived butyrate alleviates GvHD by potentiating IEC proliferation and apical junctional protein expression through HDAC inhibition.88 Butyrate elicits anti-inflammatory IL-10 receptor-α subunit by activating STAT3 and inhibiting HDAC, which increases the production of colonic Mucin2 and tight junction proteins and consequently protects against LPS leakage and inflammation.89,90 Butyrate also binds to GPR43 on IECs to generate AMPs such as RegIIIγ and β-defensin by activating mTOR and STAT3.91 The synergistic effect between butyrate-induced AMP cathelicidin and mucus formation confers to the host an optimal innate response against amebic colitis.92 Butyrate activates the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in IECs, thereby protecting the intestinal barrier from damage caused by Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxins.93 In the setting of dietary fiber deficiency, the gut microbiome preferentially utilizes mucins or polysaccharides as energy sources, which undermines the permeability of the internal mucus layer and compromises the spatial separation between gut commensals and the intestinal lamina propria, thus predisposing the gut to the invasion of pathogen C. rodentium, indirectly proving the importance of SCFAs in the intestinal chemical barrier.94–96 Total SCFA levels were found to be dramatically diminished in a high-fat diet (HFD) group (fat 40% energy) than in low-fat or moderate-fat diet groups, supporting the significance of a high-fiber diet and low-fat diet in keeping adequate SCFA levels and long-term fitness.97 Notably, the exposure of stem cells to a high concentration of butyrate by mucosal injury results in butyrate-mediated HDAC inhibition and impaired stem cell function, which potentially exerts detrimental impacts on intestinal regeneration and wound repair in a colitis model.98 However, stem cell proliferation is also impeded when in contact with potentially pernicious components in the lumen because of this appropriately inhibitory action of butyrate.98 Moreover, oral administration of inulin exacerbates αIL10R-induced colitis, which is largely attributable to the enrichment of butyrate-producing bacteria and elevated levels of cecal butyrate, indicating that the overproduction of SCFAs may exert detrimental effects on the host.99

Collectively, SCFAs are considered the most abundant microbiome-derived metabolites in the gut lumen and are endowed with the robust capacity to dampen intestinal inflammation, protect against pathogen invasion and maintain barrier integrity largely by activating GPCRs or inducing their suppressive effects on HDACs to further influence gene expression.

Compelling and accumulating evidence has addressed both the association and the causality between microbiota-derived SCFAs and metabolic disorders in animal models of obesity or metabolic diseases.100,101 Additionally, fecal SCFA levels are significantly decreased in healthy young adults following long-term (6 months) HFD.97 Dietary fiber facilitates significant enrichment of a select group of SCFA-producing strains in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, the higher the abundance and diversity of SCFA-producing bacteria are, the more improvement observed in the hemoglobin A1c levels of the subjects, which can be partly attributed to the SCFA-mediated increase in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) production.47 However, this study is not sufficient to highlight the causal metabolic links between certain SCFAs and type 2 diabetes. Some methodologies, such as genome-wide genotyping, gut metagenomic sequencing, and fecal SCFA level analysis, are powerful when utilized in conjunction with one another and demonstrated that butyrate is capable of improving insulin response, while deficiencies in the generation or utilization of propionate enhance the risk of type 2 diabetes.102

SCFAs also exert beneficial effects on host metabolism and weight control by increasing energy expenditure and lipid oxidation. In mice with HFD-induced obesity, the administration of butyrate leads to remarkable decreases in body weight, mainly driven by higher energy expenditure and increased catabolism. Such an effect is associated with the increased expression of genes that regulate metabolism (such as Pck1) and the significantly decreased activity of HDAC3, which is involved in promoting obesity.113 Butyrate administration shifts enterocyte metabolism from glycolysis towards fatty acid utilization, thereby mitigating the development of endotoxemia and atherosclerosis in mice.114 Acetate also serves as a microbial metabolic signal to activate the immune deficiency innate immune pathway in enteroendocrine cells in the Drosophila model, thereby facilitating the production of the endocrine peptide Tachykinin, which is imperative for optimal lipid metabolism.115 Interestingly, the thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue is drastically impaired in mice treated with antibiotics, a phenotype that is counteracted by gavage of butyrate, providing a novel avenue through which to demonstrate the correlation between the gut microbiome and its metabolites with thermoregulation.116 It remains to be investigated whether these benefits from SCFA oxidative metabolism will be reflected in humans. Intriguingly, the lactate produced by exercise enters the gut through the circulatory system and specifically enhances the growth of Veillonella, which can catabolize lactate into propionate, thereby enhancing the host’s athletic performance.117 Therefore, SCFAs exert beneficial effects on host metabolism and ameliorate metabolic disorders, largely by modulating dietary behavior and energy expenditure in the host, indicating the significance of SCFAs in the gut–brain axis.

SCFAs can enter the systemic circulation to facilitate additional crosstalk between the extraintestinal tissues and the gut. Specific examples include the following.

Hence, the benefits of SCFAs on the host are not limited in the gut, as they can disseminate into the bloodstream and thus communicate with multiple cells in target tissues in a GPCR-dependent manner or by suppressing HDAC activity. Notably, the effects of microbially derived SCFAs are potentially context-dependent. SCFAs are generally beneficial during homeostasis while exerting deleterious effects in the context of inflammation. Additionally, the dose, duration, and host genetics are the determinants of whether intestinal SCFAs trigger physiological or pathological effects.32,99,111

Certain aspects of the gut microbiome can convert food components (TRP) into indole-containing catabolites that can modulate the immune system in an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-dependent manner, contributing to intestinal and systemic homeostasis (Supplementary Table 2).

Humans obtain TRP, which is an essential aromatic amino acid, mainly from a protein-rich diet (including eggs, tuna fish, meat, cheese, beans, and nuts).134 In the gastrointestinal tract, TRP is catabolized mainly through three pathways.135–138 Initially, more than 90% of dietary TRP is metabolized into kynurenine (Kyn) in immune cells and epithelial cells in an enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1)-dependent manner.135,136 Then, specific intestinal flora convert TRP into indole and indole derivatives as endogenic physiological AHR agonists.137 Ultimately, TRP metabolites such as serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) are generated in enterochromaffin cells through TRP hydroxylase 1.138

First, it is well recognized that microbially TRP metabolites, namely, indole and its multifarious derivatives, play central roles in ameliorating intestinal inflammation and conferring protection against carcinogenesis in an AHR-dependent manner. Diminished expression of AHR in intestinal tissues has been revealed in patients with IBD.135 Studies using AHR-deficient mice have also revealed that impaired AHR signaling correlates with diminished levels of IL-22-producing ILC3s and consequently culminates in a worsening of colitis.139 Interestingly, alpinetin (an AHR agonist)-mediated AHR activation modulates miR-302/DNMT-1/CREB signaling, thereby increasing Treg differentiation and conferring protection against colitis.140 Additionally, IEC-specific AHR deletion contributes to dysfunctional Wnt-β-catenin signaling, which largely impairs the differentiation of ISCs into IECs due to unrestricted ISC proliferation, rendering mice susceptible to inflammation-induced colonic tumorigenesis.141 This phenotype could subsequently be rescued via treatment with AHR agonists.141 These results highlight the importance of AHR in intestinal homeostasis. Studies using CARD9 (caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9, an IBD susceptibility gene)-knockout mice have also displayed an impaired immune response to pathogen Citrobacter, along with decreased levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and insufficient IL-22 production by ILCs.135 Further deciphering the mechanisms, the enhanced susceptibility of CARD9−/− mice to IBD is primarily attributed to the inability of their microbiome to convert TRP into AHR agonists, indicating that CARD9 affects the dynamic composition of the gut microbiome as well as TRP metabolism.135 In contrast, this adverse phenotype can be counterbalanced by colonization with Lactobacillus strains that can metabolize TRP into AHR agonists or by supplementing the diets of mice with AHR ligands.135 Intriguingly, overexpression of cytochrome p450 family proteins such as Cyp1A1 in mice stimulates the depletion and inactivation of natural AHR ligands, exhibiting decreased levels of AHR-dependent ILC3s and Th17 cells, as well as a failure to withstand enteric infection, which can be reversed by dietary AHR ligands.142 Some studies underscore the functional immunoregulatory capabilities of certain microbially TRP metabolites. For example, the gut commensal L. reuteri facilitates the catabolism of dietary TRP into AHR agonist indole-3-lactic acid (ILA). The subsequent AHR signaling in CD4+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) lowers the expression of transcription factor T helper-inducing POZ/Krüppel-like factor (also known as ZBTB7B) and further triggers RUNX3 expression, thereby contributing to the development of immunoregulatory T cells (CD4+ CD8αα double-positive IELs) to prevent intestinal inflammation (Fig.
3).143 Thus, the intricate and dynamic TRP metabolite-AHR crosstalk can modulate intestinal immunity through parallel mechanisms. Independent of AHR, microbial-derived indole-3-carboxaldehydecan elicit a protective type I IFN-dependent signaling response in IECs to protect against intestinal inflammation resulting from myeloablative chemoradiation and acute GvHD.144

Furthermore, gut microbial-derived indole derivatives are also endowed with additional far-reaching functions, including strengthening the intestinal barrier integrity and conferring resistance against enteric pathogens (Fig.
3). Lactobacillus reuteri metabolizes TRP into indole-3-aldehyde (IAId) that activates IL-22-producing ILC3s in an AHR-dependent manner, thereby exerting colonization resistance against mucosal Candidiasis.137 Mdo-miRNA7267-3p, a newly identified plant-derived exosomal microRNA, boosts AHR-dependent production of IL-22 by ILC3s by accelerating indole-3-carbaldehyde (also known as indole-3-aldehyde, I3A) production, ultimately strengthening barrier function.145 Additionally, independent of AHR, indole facilitates the expression of apical junction proteins involved in the maintenance of IEC structure and function.134 In addition, indole participates in reinforcing colonization resistance against enteric pathogens by downregulating the expression of their virulence repertoire146 and mitigating their invasiveness.147 Peptostreptococcus russellii, a novel commensal bacteria, harbors gene clusters involved in converting TRP into indoleacrylic acid (IA), which enhances the differentiation and expression of goblet cell-associated genes such as Muc2, ultimately leading to decreased susceptibility to intestinal injury.148,149 A similar mechanism has been demonstrated for indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) in mice fed a HFD.150 IPA also diminishes intestinal mucosal permeability and suppresses inflammation in a pregnane X receptor- and TLR4-dependent manner.151 Both in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that IPA inhibits the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and decreases their intracellular TRP level.152 Gut symbiont Clostridium sporogenes (C. sporogenes) produce IPA in mice following intestinal colonization.13 Notably, an intact fldC gene is essential for C. sporogenes-mediated IPA generation. Mice colonized with fldC mutant C. sporogenes fail to generate IPA and exhibit enhanced intestinal permeability and an increased number of circulating myeloid and lymphoid cells.13 The results of this study demonstrate the significance and necessity of specific microbial genes in microbial metabolite production and host immunity.

Aberrant alterations including active IDO1, increased levels of Kyn and diminished IAA are observed both locally in the gut and systemically in patients with IBD, potentially reflecting metabolic reprogramming from microbial to host-dominant metabolism under pathological conditions.135,136 Notably, IDO1-mediated generation of the endogenous AHR ligand derived from TRP potentially induces intestinal inflammation.153,154 Mechanistically, a class of oxazole-containing compounds derived from the diet, environment and gut microbiome boosts the formation of TRP-derived metabolites (such as Kyn) in response to activated IDO1 and consequently activates AHR in IECs, which suppresses the CD1d-mediated generation of IL-10 by IECs and induces IL-13- and IFN-γ-producing invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell-mediated inflammation in the gut.153 Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the role of environmental oxazolone-like molecules in intestinal immunity. Questions regarding what alternative or redundant intestinal immune cells respond to the IDO1-AHR axis and the functional modulation of IDO1-mediated responses in additional animal models remain to be investigated.155

The microbially derived TRP metabolites can enter the circulatory system and thus exert immunoregulatory effects on anatomically remote organs, including the brain, liver, and pancreas (Fig.
4). In pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), the relative abundance of TRP and indole lactate are negatively associated with the risk of MS.156 In particular, a protective role of TRP metabolite components in CNS inflammation has been observed in an animal model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that can replicate many of the characteristics of MS. TRP deficiency or specific deletion of AHR in astrocytes drives the recruitment of peripheral inflammatory cells to the brain and further potentiates the pathogenic and neurotoxic activities of astrocytes, thus amplifying local inflammation.157,158 Microbially derived TRP metabolites can cross the BBB and further regulate the immune activity of microglia and astrocytes through AHR-driven mechanisms.157,159 Gut microbiome-derived TRP metabolites such as indole-3-sulfate, IPA, and IAId signal through AHR in astrocytes to negatively modulate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation through the suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2), thereby mitigating CNS autoimmunity.158,160 Moreover, AHR interacts with the genes that encode the proteins vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) and TGF-α, suppressing the transcription of the former while potentiating that of the latter. In this manner, AHR activation in microglia dampens the responsiveness of neighboring astrocytes to CNS inflammation.157,159

The suppressive effect of microbially produced indole derivatives on the hepatic inflammatory response has drawn much attention recently. For example, indole suppresses NF-κB activation while activating NLRP3 signaling in Kupffer cells to counteract LPS-induced hepatic inflammation in mice.161 IAA directly diminishes fatty acid- and LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine (such as TNF-α and IL-1β) generation in macrophages by suppressing the NF-κB pathway and abrogating the recruitment of cells to chemokines.162 In a mouse model with alcoholic liver disease (ALD), administration of IAA boosts AHR-dependent IL-22 production by ILC3s and further maintains the expression of regenerating islet-derived protein III-gamma (REG3G, C-type lectin involved in epithelial barrier integrity), thereby dampening the translocation of bacteria to the liver as well as ALD progression.163 Collectively, these encouraging findings describe the long-distance regulation of immune cells in extraintestinal organs by gut microbiome-derived TRP metabolite signaling through AHR.

Gut microbial TRP metabolites participate in the modulation of anorectic hormone generation and glucose and insulin-associated metabolism. Both patients and animal models with metabolic syndrome display gut microbiome deficiencies in converting TRP into indole and its derivatives as AHR agonists.164,165 Administration of AHR agonists or a Lactobacillus strain that naturally generates AHR ligands restores AHR signaling to increase GLP-1 secretion, ultimately ameliorating metabolic syndrome.164 In addition, intestinal IDO1 deletion or inhibition improves insulin sensitivity in obese mice, which is largely attributable to the rewiring of TRP metabolism from Kyn production towards a microbiome-dependent production of indole derivatives and IL-22, providing support for the notion that gut microbiome-derived AHR agonists are responsible for shaping metabolic homeostasis.154 Indeed, colonic enteroendocrine L cells increase GLP-1 secretion following a short exposure to physiological levels of indole, but this phenotype is suppressed during prolonged exposure.166 TRP-derived indole generated by the gut microbiome suppresses the expression of the miR-181 family in white adipocytes in mice to ameliorate HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance, highlighting a novel mechanism in the gut–fat axis.165 By acting through AHR in hepatocytes, I3A attenuates cytokine-induced lipogenesis, offering promise for gut microbially derived TRP metabolites to treat metabolic disease by targeting lipid metabolism.162

It has been established that certain bacteria (such as Clostridial species) possess TRP decarboxylase, which converts TRP into the neurotransmitter tryptamine.167 The microbiome-derived tryptamine serves as a ligand for the gut epithelium-expressed serotonin receptor 4 (also known as 5-HT receptor 4, 5-HT4 receptor), contributing to heightened intracellular cAMP levels and increased fluid secretion into the gut to accelerate gastrointestinal motility,168,169 indicating therapeutic potential in gastrointestinal motility disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Collectively, similar to SCFAs, TRP metabolites generated by gut commensals are commonly endowed with the capacity to stimulate anti-inflammatory pathways, maintain intestinal barrier integrity, and ameliorate metabolic disorders. Certain metabolites, such as 5-HT and tryptamine, function as neurotransmitters to effectively modulate the gut–brain axis.

The liver metabolizes cholesterol into primary bile acids that are retained in and released from the gallbladder into the small intestine where they can be utilized to dissolve dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins. The large proportion of primary bile acids are assimilated in the ileum and recycled back to the liver; a small proportion (~3%) enter the large intestine in which they are easily deconjugated and thus converted by the gut bacteria into secondary bile acids that exert pleiotropic effects on host immunity.172

One of the essential immunoregulatory functions of secondary bile acids is to augment gut barrier function through multiple mechanisms, including maintaining intestinal barrier integrity and inhibiting pathogen colonization. As an example, deoxycholic acid (DCA), one of the secondary bile acids, downregulates prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis in a farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-dependent manner, thereby accelerating intestinal crypt regeneration and wound repair.173 Supplementation with a mixture of lithocholic acid (LCA, another secondary bile acid) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is favorable for maintaining gut barrier integrity through activation of the FXR-FGF15 pathway.174 Additionally, several studies have revealed that specific bacterial-derived secondary bile acids favor an intestinal microenvironment that is detrimental for pathogen colonization. The archetypal example is Clostridium scindens (C. scindens), which harbors a beneficial metabolic function enabling the 7α-dehydroxylation of primary bile acids into DCA, conferring resistance to pathogen C. difficile expansion. Antibiotic-mediated disruption of specific microbiota such as C. scindens leads to the accumulation of primary bile acids, thereby increasing spore germination of C. difficile.175,176 Consistently, a recent study provides correlative support for the notion that DCA reduces pathogen burden, and it has been shown that oral administration of DCA is responsible for inhibiting Campylobacter jejuni-induced colitis in mice by suppressing the expression of proinflammatory genes in IECs.177 In addition, both DCA and LCA are similarly shown to decolonize pathogen C. difficile, albeit by a distinct mechanism that DCA and LCA potentiate the activity of TRP-derived antibiotics secreted by the known DCA and LCA producers C. scindens and C. sordellii.178 Notably, whether microbiota-derived LCA exerts a beneficial or harmful part in pathogen intestinal colonization remains elusive. Indeed, it was recently reported that LCA is conducive to certain biological processes in Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), including the formation of long chains and increased biofilm formation, thereby promoting the expansion of VRE.179 These studies provide pivotal information regarding how secondary bile acids may signal to other pathogens and host cells, which offers promise for the rational design of clinical translation based on microbiota-derived metabolites. In fact, oral administration of UDCA is therapeutically efficacious in a case of patient with C. difficile infection (CDI)-associated pouchitis.180 However, the utilization of live C. scindens appears to offer advantages over exogenous administration of metabolites, as C. scindens exerts a two-pronged approach to suppress pathogens, namely, enhancing secondary bile acids while simultaneously diminishing primary bile acids.61

Despite the beneficial effects on gut barrier function, the carcinogenic effects of secondary bile acids and the underlying mechanisms have become the focus of microbial metabolomic analyses. A meta-analysis integrated with eight studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients receiving fecal metagenomic sequencing revealed the increased generation of secondary bile acids from CRC metagenomes.181 Similarly, DCA is significantly elevated in patients with multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas.182 A HFD induces a remarkable increase in DCA, and tauro-β-muricholic acid triggers aberrant proliferation and DNA damage in Lgr5-expressing (Lgr5+) cancer stem cells by inhibiting intestinal FXR, thereby accelerating CRC progression.183 Furthermore, the onset and development of primary HCC is also modulated by secondary bile acids through multiple distinct mechanisms, such as DNA damage, inflammation-associated tumorigenesis, hepatotoxicity,184,185 and favoring an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by diminishing the accumulation of hepatic NKT cells.186–188 Thus, secondary bile acids show distinct phenotypic effects on the host, including triggering tumorigenesis while maintaining intestinal barrier function.

There is growing awareness that, in addition to SCFAs, microbial fermentation of dietary fiber (especially polysaccharides and oligosaccharides) can produce considerable levels of succinate, which is classically considered the precursor of propionate in microbial metabolism and an intermediate in tricarboxylic acid cycle as well as a crucial ligand for GPR91 (also known as SUCNR1)14 (Fig.
5).

Microbially generated succinate is increasingly recognized to benefit the host as an orchestrator of metabolic homeostasis. For example, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), a commonly used antidiabetic agent, drive significant enrichment of Bacteroidetes and induce a functional shift in the intestinal microbial metabolome, particularly enhancing succinate generation. In this manner, the treatment of HFD mice with DPP-4i improves glucose homeostasis.189 Analogous to the properties of propionate, succinate is sufficient to activate IGN in obese mice by enhancing the activity of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (the rate-limiting enzyme in IGN), thereby leading to the amelioration of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance and the modulation of body weight.174,190 In addition, elevated circulating levels of succinate in mice swiftly drive thermogenic respiration in brown adipose tissue, a function that protects against diet-induced obesity and hyperglycemia by initiating UCP1-dependent thermogenesis and supporting the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-mediated oxidation.191,192

Notably, inconsistent with the above point of view, data obtained from human prospective studies revealed that obesity and impaired glucose homeostasis correlate with increased systemic concentrations of succinate concomitant with the elevated levels of succinate-producing microbiome and diminished levels of succinate-consuming bacteria.193 Therefore, whether succinate potentially acts as a detrimental metabolic product derived from microbiota in humans or whether disrupted gut microbiome and aberrant intestinal permeability under obesity conditions may contribute to elevated succinate are topics that require further investigation.

Succinate has recently attracted great attention because of its role in immune modulation. As an example, succinate in mice elevated by the administration of longan polysaccharide may boost host immune function in the context of stress, which can be attributed to favorable alterations in the intestinal immunity index such as IgA, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TGF-β.194 Similarly, the elevated succinate levels resulting from polyphenols in combination with HFD exert inhibitory effects on the growth and proliferation of colon cancer cells as well as angiogenesis.195

However, data from patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) have revealed that increased succinate in serum and the intestine as well as elevated expression of its receptor SUCNR1 in the gut participate in the deterioration of intestinal inflammation and fibrosis in CD patients.201 LPS induces remarkably elevated levels of succinate, which can exacerbate inflammation. Succinate fortifies the transcription factor HIF-1α, supporting the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β by macrophages.202 Moreover, SDH-mediated mitochondrial oxidation of succinate triggers a metabolic reorientation that shifts mitochondria away from ATP synthesis and towards ROS generation, thereby supporting a proinflammatory state.203 Further comprehensive studies are needed to identify the functional regulatory effects of succinate on intestinal immunity and inflammation.

Lactic acid (lactate), another microbial metabolite derived from the diet and commonly found in milk, harbors a wide array of metabolic and immune properties, including serving as HDAC inhibitors, an essential energy source for cell renewal, and signaling molecules14 (Fig.
5).

Oral administration of lactate derived from L. helveticus elicits the dendrite extension of gut CX3CR1+ cells into the intestinal lumen to bind antigens in a GPR31-dependent manner, triggering an intensive antigen-specific immune response against Salmonella infection.204 Similarly, the administration of L. lactis to infected neonatal mice effectively diminishes the infectious burden of intestinal pathogen Vibrio cholerae and consequently enhances survival, which is largely attributed to the local abundance of lactic acid.205 These results have revealed that lactate-mediated immunomodulation in the gut can provide support for decolonizing intestinal pathogens. In addition, the increased lactate levels owing to supplementation with lactate-producing bacteria-type symbionts such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus stimulates ISC-mediated epithelial development by Wnt/β-catenin signals in Paneth cells and intestinal stromal cells.206 Notably, mice with deletion of GPR81 display impaired ISC-mediated epithelial development, indicating that lactate favorably orchestrates the gut barrier function in a GPR81-dependent manner.206 In contrast, in Drosophila with a null mutation in Peptidoglycan recognition protein-SD, excessive lactate generated from overgrown L. plantarumin activates the intestinal NADPH oxidase Nox and thus boosts ROS production, ultimately contributing to intestinal injury and intestinal dysplasia associated with aging.207 This example highlights that the beneficial or detrimental effects of lactate are potentially dependent on the dose, experimental model, and host immunocompetence.

The above-mentioned metabolites are not all-encompassing; however, high-resolution mass spectrometry and metabolomics are advancing rapidly, which confers an additional lens through which other bacterial-derived metabolites involved in a myriad of diseases can be identified (Fig.
5).208

One of the most pronounced examples is desaminotyrosine (DAT), which is a bacterial metabolite derived from flavonoids and produced by the gut commensal C. orbiscindens. This metabolite is sufficient to boost type I IFN production by amplifying IFNAR and STAT1 signaling, thereby conferring protection against influenza infection.209 Treating BM-derived macrophages with DAT triggers IFN-stimulated gene transcription and diminishes viral RNA levels in these cells following poliovirus as well as oral reovirus infection.210,211 These results highlight the causal role of bacterial-derived metabolites in combating viral infection. Similarly, ascorbate is considered a bioactive microbial metabolite related to CD and can induce T cell apoptosis by targeting the energy metabolism of activated effector CD4+ T cells.212 In addition, circulating metabolites such as mevalonate and dimethylglycine, which are produced by a consortium of 11 rare bacteria (predominately Bacteroidetes) isolated from healthy individuals feces, seem to potentiate the systemic development of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells, thereby combating the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) and enhancing ICI-mediated anti-tumor immunity in mice with melanoma.43,213 This groundbreaking research has demonstrated that rare microbiome members potentially harbor profound effects on host immunity. Another microbial metabolite is urolithin A (UroA), derived from polyphenolics abundant in fruits, which can upregulate epithelial tight junction proteins through activation of AHR-NRF2-dependent pathways, enhancing barrier function and ameliorating intestinal inflammation.214 Recently, in a phase I clinical trial, short-term oral supplementation of UroA in elderly people who lack exercise is safe and exerts an instrumental effect on improving skeletal muscle health and decelerating aging, which is largely attributable to the capability of UroA to activate mitochondrial autophagy.215

Notably, certain microbial metabolites appear to detrimentally impact host immunity. For example, spermine, putrescine, and histamine suppress NLRP6 inflammasome activation and reduce subsequent IL-18 secretion, thereby impairing gut epithelial barrier integrity.216 Similarly, microbiome-derived 1,2-propanediol strengthens virulence factor expression in pathogens, supporting the intestinal colonization and expansion of pathogens such as C. rodentium.217

Imidazole propionate, produced by type 2 diabetes-associated bacteria as a metabolite of histidine, is heightened in type 2 diabetes and impairs glucose tolerance and insulin signaling, a process achieved by inhibiting insulin receptor substrate (IRS) in a p38g/p62/mTORC1-dependent manner.218 In a similar vein, the gut microbiome that harbors tyrosine phenol-lyase can catabolize dietary tyrosine into the precursor phenyl sulfate. Subsequently, the increased circulating levels of phenyl sulfate exert deleterious effects on the kidneys via damaging podocytes, accelerating glomerular basement membrane thickening and inducing proteinuria.219 These results suggest that therapeutically targeting the microbiota responsible for these metabolic pathways can ameliorate symptoms of metabolic disease.

In summary, in addition to common microbial metabolites, a myriad of novel small molecules or catabolites that are generated by the gut microbiome function as chemical messengers to transmit microbial-derived signals to various parts of the host, contributing to the dynamic interaction between the gut microbiome and humans and exerting instrumental or detrimental effects on the outcomes of multiple disorders, such as intestinal inflammation, autoimmune disease, metabolic diseases, and tumors. Further comprehensive studies are warranted to unravel the roles of these additional metabolites and the underlying mechanisms.220

In addition to the modulation of microbiome-derived metabolites on host immune and metabolism, the gut microbiome also establishes fine-tuned communications with the host immune system (especially CD4+ T cells) through multiple metabolite-independent mechanisms, as described below and depicted in Fig.
6.

CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells have been extensively identified as an indispensable component that is responsible for immune tolerance to nonpathogenic antigens as well as exerting suppressive effects on pathogen-induced tissue damage mediated by Teff cells.40,221–224 Foxp3+ Treg cells are substantially enriched in intestinal lamina propria,225–227 and they are composed of thymus-derived Treg cells that impede Teff cell-induced inflammation in the host222 and peripherally differentiated Treg (pTreg) cells that confer immunological tolerance to nonpathogenic antigens.40 More precisely, Foxp3+ Treg cells in the gut can be subclassified into at least three subsets based on their expression of RAR-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt), GATA3, zinc-finger protein Helios, and the receptor neuropilin 1 (Nrp1)222,223,228,229 (Table
1).

Altogether, these results emphasize the significance of Treg cells in enabling the development of a harmonious coexistence among the host, the trillions of noninvasive, symbiotic microorganisms that comprise the microbiome, and normal dietary antigens. There is considerable overlap in the responses of Treg cells to Clostridium, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides, suggesting that dynamic interactions between these promising, unconventional probiotics and Treg cells also hold promise for the utilization of various beneficial commensals to target immune system deficits in patients.

RORγt+ Th17 cells, a subpopulation of CD4+ Teff cells, account for 30–40% of the T cells in intestinal lamina propria and are induced in response to TGF-β and IL-6 or IL-21.257 The physiological condition of the Th17 cells is largely dependent on the surrounding cytokine environment. For example, Th17 cells that are differentiated in a setting that includes TGF-β and IL-6 confer protection against extracellular pathogenic infection and support the intestinal barrier integrity in certain scenarios.155 Commensal-specific Th17 cells also secrete type 2 cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13 to aid in repairing acute injury in the mucosa.258

Hence, in accordance with the existing reports, epithelial adhesion is pivotal in the process of bacteria-induced Th17 cells. The question of which specific microorganisms are sufficient to stimulate the development of potentially pathogenic or homeostatic Th17 cells still needs to be thoroughly investigated. How to differentiate the Th17 cells that facilitate gut barrier function from those that are implicated in pathogenic proinflammatory responses is another unanswered question.

The capability of the gut microbiome to manipulate the induction of Th1 cells has also drawn much attention recently. For instance, Klebsiella species, which usually reside in the oral cavity, can ectopically colonize the gut and preferentially elicit a proinflammatory Th1 response via either IECs or DCs.282 TLR and IL-18 signaling from IECs to the CD11b− CD103+ DC subset contributes to Klebsiella-mediated Th1 cell induction and increased expression of IFN-γ.282 In addition, microbial-derived products also participate in modulating proinflammatory Th1 cell induction. Bilophila wadsworthia (B. wadsworthia) has the capacity to convert deconjugated taurine into sulfite, which is utilized for its energy metabolism. The subsequent proliferation of B. wadsworthia triggers a proinflammatory IFN-γ-producing Th1 cell response and exacerbates colitis in IL-10−/− mice.283 Intriguingly, as a pathway of self-modulation, Th1 cells can also generate IL-10 to convert proinflammatory Th1 cells into T cells with regulatory activity,284 and signals from the microbiome-derived SCFAs potentially manipulate such a Th1 response, which may confer unique opportunities for therapeutic intervention in Th1-driven immune diseases.64

IgA is the most abundant secretory immunoglobulin isotype at mucosal surfaces. Polymeric IgA interacts with the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) on the basolateral surface of the gut epithelium and is further transported to the apical surface in a transcytosis-mediated manner. IgA is secreted into the intestinal lumen through proteolytic cleavage of the secretory component of pIgR.285 Noncanonical NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) signaling in DCs is required for pIgR expression in IECs and IgA secretion.286 Generally, most secreted IgA (sIgA) is produced in a T cell-dependent manner.287 Specifically, bacterial antigen stimulates the migration of IgA+ B cells from Peyer’s patches (PPs) to the intestinal stromal layer where IgA+ B cells produce IgA and secrete it into the intestinal lumen.288 CCL28 indirectly promotes IgA secretion by stimulating the homing of IgA antibody-secreting cells (ASCs).289 Gut PCs can also generate IgA through a T cell-independent mechanism. For instance, endoplasmic reticulum stress in IEC elicits the expansion and activation of peritoneal B1b cells in a T cell-independent and microbiota-independent manner, leading to an intensive barrier-protective IgA response.290

Interestingly, the IgM antibody isotype partially compensates for IgA deficiency. Furthermore, there is an intriguing probability that varying microbiota engender qualitatively different IgA responses. That is, under the condition of IgA, potentially pathogenic microbes potentially induce compensatory IgM responses, while commensals such as B. fragilis potentially display a pathway that particularly elicits IgA rather than compensatory IgM.303–305

The modulation of the gut microbiome in the innate immune system seemingly extends far beyond classic innate immune cells. ILCs that are deficient of any antigen-specific receptors serve as a newly discovered arm of the innate immune system, and their phenotype and functional plasticity are elicited by different transcription factors.306,307 ILC3s, a subset of ILCs, converge in the intestinal tract and lymphoid tissues and establish considerable communication with the gut microbiome and immune cells to form a finely tuned network between the individual and its commensals that support and maintain gut homeostasis.308 ILC3s modulate local processes through which mononuclear phagocytes in the lamina propria capture commensal-associated antigens.

ILC3s, considered the best-characterized ILC lineage, have become a focus of the immune field because of their diversified functions in modulating the delicate balance between immune tolerance to nonpathogenic antigens and swiftly and vigorously withstanding potential pathogenic stimuli, which is largely attributed to their interaction with intestinal immune cells and the gut microbiome. Additional studies are warranted to provide a more in-depth characterization of the biological behavior of ILC3s and the influence of relevant cytokines (including IL-23, IL-1β, IL-22) on ILC3.336

In 2018, over 18.1 million individuals were newly diagnosed with cancer, affecting 9.6 million lives globally; thus, cancer can be considered the single most significant obstacle to extending life expectancy.337 The global burden of cancer is anticipated to rise as increasing populations are exposed to risk factors. Epidemiologic studies support that genetic susceptibility,338 environmental factors,38,339–341 metabolic disorders,342 and/or chronic infection343 contribute to the onset of cancer. As our understanding of the gut microbiome grows, we have recently come to appreciate intriguing evidence suggesting that the gut microbiome plays a momentous role in tumorigenesis and progression, especially extraintestinal neoplasms, such as hepatocellular carcinoma,32 mammary cancer,33 pancreatic cancer,344 and melanoma.35 We seek to summarize the latest data demonstrating alterations in the intestinal microbiota of patients with the above-mentioned extraintestinal cancers (Table
2).

Pancreatic cancer has emerged as the seventh leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The incidence of pancreatic cancer has risen annually, and ~458,918 new cases have been diagnosed worldwide in 2018. This type of cancer is interrelated with the gut microbiome and has an extremely unfavorable prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of merely 9%.337,345 The onset and development of pancreatic cancer is partially influenced by certain risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and chronic pancreatitis, all of which have been identified to be associated with gut dysbiosis.102,126,345,346 Consequently, gut dysbiosis has been postulated to facilitate the development of pancreatic cancer by extraintestinal mechanisms.

Tumor stroma-producing pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) have been well established to play a central role in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment.350 The assumption that the gut microbiome facilitates tumor progression by activating PSC merits further experiments and exploration. Further studies are warranted to address whether successful modulation of the gut microbiome potentially enhances the therapeutic effect of pancreatic cancer. Additional human studies are required prior to clinical application.

Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, and HCC accounts for ~90% of all primary liver cancer cases.362 Liver cancer incidence is rising faster than any other cancer in both men and women. It is estimated that in the United States, there will be ~42,030 new liver cancer cases and 31,780 deaths in 2019.363 HCC is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, with its poor prognosis (overall ratio of mortality to morbidity is 0.95) in part due to the absence of early specific symptoms as well as the lack of effective and accurate diagnostic biomarkers.364 The overall median survival of untreated patients with HCC is 4 months, ranging from 2 months for advanced cancer to 14 months for early-stage cancer.365

Gut dysbiosis is a pivotal stepexpress interleukin-10 receptor and in the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC. This dysbiosis is facilitated by various pathways, including the production of tumor-accelerating and SASP-accelerating metabolites such as DCA derived from the dysbiotic microbiome, the increase in hepatic contact with microbiome-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) such as LPS and the reduction in the accumulation of CD8+ T cells and NKT cells in the hepatic microenvironment, as well as consistent hepatic exposure to tumor-promoting cytokines such as IL-25. The utilization of inhibitors to target such microbial-derived metabolites or gut-derived detrimental cytokines represents a potential therapeutic intervention.

Breast cancer occurs in mammary gland epithelial tissue, and it is the most common malignant neoplasm among women. There are ~3.86 million newly diagnosed female breast cancer cases in America in 2019.397 Because of the extensive use of mammography for breast cancer screening as well as the improvement of personalized medication,398 the overall 5-year relative survival rate of female breast cancer patients in America has reached 90.3%, but international differences vary widely and are as low as 66.1% in developing countries.399 Hereditary factors such as a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer and genetic mutations (in BRCA1, BRCA2, and other novel susceptibility genes for breast cancer, such as SNX32, ALK and BTN3A2) are responsible for 5 to 10% of breast cancer cases.337,400 Its rising incidence is attributed to nonhereditary risk factors that are closely associated with menstruation of an inappropriate duration, reproduction, and supplementation with exogenous hormones, as well as stress.337,401 Notably, there is a strong and significant positive correlation between obesity and the incidence of breast cancer; the risk of breast cancer increases by 12% with every 5-unit increase in body mass index.402

Collectively, the gut microbiome potentially affects carcinogenesis through its far-reaching impacts on estrogen metabolism, energy metabolism, and the anti-tumor function of the immune system.

The alterations in the gut microbiome also potentially contribute to distal effects on other extraintestinal tumors, such as lung carcinoma, prostate cancer, and melanoma, through modulation of systemic metabolism/immune. For example, a consortium of 11 bacterial strains, including B. rodentium, establishes anti-tumor immunity and confines melanoma growth when inoculated into GF mice.35 There are discrepancies in the intestinal microbial composition and metabolic functions between patients with and without prostate cancer;437–440 for instance, the aberrant metabolome of individuals with prostate cancer is characterized by the presence of high levels of bacteria associated with carbohydrate metabolism pathways while lacking bacteria associated with folate production.437 Compared with male patients with prostate cancer, men without prostate cancer are characterized by higher α-diversity in the gut microbiome.438 There are measurable differences in the gut microbiome composition between prostate cancer patients undergoing oral androgen receptor axis-targeted therapies and those who are not.438 The knowledge and understanding of the effects of the gut microbiome on the occurrence and development of lung carcinoma is extremely limited. A clinical trial has shown an immediate association between gut microbiome and lung cancer. That is, Bacteroides, Veillonella, and Fusobacterium are increased in fecal samples in lung cancer patients compared to healthy individuals.441 Gut dysbiosis potentially triggers lung cancer proliferation through diminished levels of butyrate.441 Bacterial alterations have also been revealed in lung cancer tissues, although their significance remains indistinct. Streptococcus and Prevotella are enriched in pulmonary tumor tissue,442 and the genera Veillonella and Megasphaera can potentially serve as biomarkers for lung cancer with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity.443 However, whether it is a causative agent or a bystander to some additional process remains unclear. Mechanically, the local pulmonary microbiome activates IL-17-producing Vγ6+Vδ1+ γδ T cells through Myd88-dependent IL-1β and IL-23 secretion, thus promoting inflammation-associated lung adenocarcinoma.444 With improvements in tumorigenesis models and more advanced detection techniques for bacteria and their proteins, as well as microbial-derived metabolites, the significance of such microbiomes will become clear. As described below, changes to the gut microbiome influence the response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), melanoma, and lung carcinoma, as well as HCC.

The immune response of T cells is modulated partly by negative regulatory pathways (also known as immune checkpoints). Two such checkpoints, PD-1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA-4, also known as CD152), have attracted widespread attention. Under pathological conditions, CTLA-4 and PD-1, which are expressed on activated T lymphocytes, bind to the corresponding ligand B7 molecule on APCs and PD-L1 expressed on the tumor cells, contributing to an inhibitory immune signal that refines the activity of T cells and assists tumors in evading immunosurveillance.445,446

The above studies in both preclinical models and human cohorts provide us with evidence that the microbial composition of the gut may have predictive clinical value for the therapeutic effect of ICIs. The potential confounders that may influence the research findings may also account for the phenomenon that specific microbiome signatures conducive to immunotherapy vary widely across the cohorts even in identical tumor backgrounds.458,460 The composition of the human microbiome is unique in each individual, and heritability accounts for merely 1.9% of the variation observed in distinct microbial communities. However, over 20% of interindividual microbiome variability is associated with environmental factors.467 Geographical- and ethnic-related characteristics, including sociodemographic, lifestyle, and dietary habits, are thought to partly explain these interindividual differences in gut microbiota composition.468,469 With regard to lifestyle, sleep deprivation can promote metabolic diseases by affecting gut microbial composition.470 Exercise appears to accelerate the production of microbial-derived SCFAs, along with an abundance of beneficial A. muciniphila and a decreased level of proinflammatory Proteobacteria.471–473 Chronic stress seems to dramatically alter the composition of the gut microbiome, with the expansion of inflammation-promoting bacteria as well as increased intestinal permeability.474 High-throughput in vitro screens of over 1000 marketed drugs against 40 representative human gut bacterial strains have revealed that 24% of host-targeted non-antibiotic drugs suppress the growth of at least one strain, indicating that the gastrointestinal side effects of these drugs potentially result from their effects on the gut microbiome.475 Non-antibiotic drugs, particularly proton-pump inhibitors,476 antidiabetic drugs such as metformin,477 antipsychotics,475 and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs478 are all determinants of interindividual heterogeneity in the composition and function of the gut microbiome. In addition, the microbiome in the intestinal mucosa differs from that in stool both quantitatively and compositionally.479 It is likely that misleading conclusions would be drawn if fecal microorganisms were considered to reflect the types of microorganisms in the gut, so it is essential to explore noninvasive techniques to collect samples from the gut mucosa. Moreover, sampling and analysis of the gut microbiome allows only a single time point to be studied, which means that differences in species or metabolite presence and/or abundance over time are neglected.480 Thus, the standardization of timing and intervals for microbiome profiling as well as microbial sampling sites could resolve some differences in the findings of various studies. Differences in collection, storage, sequencing, and analysis pipelines as well as experimental conditions can also explain these discrepancies.481 Microbial signals are intrinsic to every cohort but are functionally correlative, implying that function rather than specific bacterial species preferably describe and predict treatment effects.481 The search for microbial signals as predictors of tumor immunotherapy response requires in-depth investigation of microbial function and the integration of RNA-sequencing with metabolomics analysis to confirm the underlying pathways implicated in therapeutic efficacy. The synergistic effects between microbial structure (cell surface antigen, nucleic acids, and so on) and therapeutic efficacy warrant further exploration.481

Efforts are currently underway to identify optimal bacterial consortia and modulate the gut microbiome through accumulating experience from trials targeting nonmalignant disease or animal models with cancers, thereby potentiating therapeutic efficacy. Could a therapeutic answer to malignant tumors reside in the human gut? Could probiotics, FMT, or prebiotics become novel anti-tumor agents? An objective evaluation of the evidence is needed to determine whether the gut microbiome can be considered as a potential path forward for cancer treatment (Table
3).

FMT is defined as the transmission of the gut microbiome derived from healthy donors to unhealthy recipients through the digestive tract route, which aims to reestablish gut homeostasis or to provide a new balance in order to abrogate or ameliorate disease.482 FMT has been recognized as a standard treatment for recurrent CDI by official guidelines with a nearly 90% cure rate.482,483 Researchers are also increasingly realizing the potential of FMT in other noncancerous diseases, such as IBD,484–486 IBS,487 liver disease,488 and neuropsychiatric disorders.489 Hence, knowledge obtained from FMT in these diseases is also emerging evidence to indicate that FMT can be potentially employed in the management of cancer.

In principle, to make FMT more feasible in cancer therapy (including ICIs), several pivotal parameters should be taken into account. Initially, selection of an ideal donor remains a crucial issue, as preliminary evidence suggests that the gut microbiome profile of a donor is the determinant of the response rate to ICIs in mice with cancer.43,457 Several clinical trials in which FMT is being explored in cancer patients receiving ICI therapy are ongoing (NCT03353402 and NCT03341143), which take advantage of fecal materials from complete responder donors.490 However, as long as we can identify the microbiome that is conducive to cancer immunotherapy, clinicians should take advantage of balanced fecal microbiomes from healthy donors rather than dysbiotic microbiomes from patients.501 Recently, a randomized double-blind controlled trial indicated that the metabolic characteristics of donors can be delivered to the recipient to some extent, so the selection of metabolic conditions in donors should be considered one of the factors through which FMT can be optimized.502 Actually, a consensus on which particular bacterial species or the combination of bacteria are the optimal option for immune-potentiating effects has not been reached and warrants further investigation.43,457,458,460,461 Notably, low levels of bacterial taxa that coexist with the much more abundant species are potentially functionally pivotal.43,503 An additional method is implicated in an autologous FMT of fecal materials that need to be collected and preserved before an individual is sick, which necessitates large-scale fecal banking facilities. How to preserve FMT materials remains a methodological challenge. Frozen fecal products harbor lower bacterial diversity and are correlated with clinical efficacy in comparison to fresh material.504,505 The practice of preparing material for FMT in ambient air profoundly influences the viable microbial content, with disproportionately diminished levels of anaerobic commensals and thus a reduced capacity for the biosynthesis of pivotal anti-inflammatory metabolites.505 Clinical practice should take into account the administration methods of fecal microbiota when necessary. The routes of fecal infusion include oral administration (through nasogastric/nasojejunal tube or oral capsules), enema, and colonoscopy. FMT-mediated clinical efficacy for IBS patients is considered to vary with the administration route, with an increase in likelihood of improvement in colonoscopy or nasojejunal tube administration in contrast to multiple-dose oral encapsulated FMT.506 Nevertheless, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) indicated that there was no significant difference in the response rate to FMT between oral encapsulated products and delivery through colonoscopy, with oral capsulized FMT displaying decreased rates of minor adverse events and increased patient adherence.507 However, some questions remain unanswered, such as the optimal dose and interval for FMT, which may vary among different cancer populations.

Even with a greater understanding of the molecular targets and biological significance of gut microbiome-derived metabolites, a wide array of pivotal parameters should be taken into account if we are to attempt to bridge current findings to therapeutically relevant contexts. Exogenous administration of microbiome-derived metabolites appears to be therapeutically feasible. As an example, an oral formulation of B. fragilis-derived PSA called SYMB-104 has passed preclinical testing and is being explored in patients with IBD.61 Indeed, treatment of autism spectrum disorder mice with candidate microbial metabolites, such as 5-aminopentanoic acid and taurine, ameliorates behavioral abnormalities and modulates neuronal excitability in the brain.16 Together, these results have shed light on the therapeutic potential of microbiome-derived molecules in animal models. Nevertheless, similar to all oral therapeutics, a considerable challenge is that metabolites are potentially assimilated or degraded before reaching the desired tissues and cells, triggering spontaneous side effects.61 Further studies are warranted to examine their long-term safety in humans.

Probiotics are considered live microorganisms that putatively provide the host with health benefits when administered in adequate amounts. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium are frequently found in multitudinous products such as dietary supplements or drugs.508 It is at the forefront of the field to determine and exhibit the therapeutic or preventive effectiveness of probiotics in a broad range of diseases (such as sepsis in infants,509 infant colic,510 diarrhea,511 CDI,512 and infectious disease induced by pathogen Staphylococcus aureus513 as well as phenylketonuria,514) rather than attempting to enrich beneficial bacteria-derived metabolites. Theoretically, the stable engraftment of metabolites producing bacteria in the gut confers a long-term therapy choice, as a few front-loaded bacterial doses can supersede routine and repeated administration of a purified molecule to patients. Probiotics can transfer physiological concentrations of a molecule straight to the host, which eliminates the need for exogenous administration of high-dose chemical compounds and concomitant off-target effects.61 Interestingly, supplementation with pasteurized beneficial A. muciniphila exhibits a much more desirable therapeutic effect on ameliorating metabolic disorder compared to supplementation with live A. muciniphila.28 It remains unclear why pasteurized bacteria appear to be more advantageous in alleviating metabolic syndrome. Due to the infrequency of large, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in distinct clinical scenarios and human subpopulations, clinical data from other studies are of variable quality, and some publications may exhibit bias towards studies harboring positive outcomes.388

Another strategy for microbiome-based therapies is to utilize synthetically engineered microorganisms with modified bacterial functions or introduced entire new genes. An engineered EcN can express and secrete Phe-metabolizing enzymes that are activated in the gut anaerobic environment and metabolize Phe into excreted Hippurate, thus treating phenylketonuria in both monkeys and mice models. This strain has been employed in clinical trials currently underway to determine the effective dose in the human body.514 Similarly, another engineered probiotic, EcN, facilitates the conversion of NH3 into l-arginine to mitigate hyperammonemia symptoms. This strain has been moved into a phase 1 clinical study and has exhibited secure and dose-dependent metabolic activity in vivo, indicating its therapeutic potential in hyperammonemia disorders, including urea cycle disorders and hepatic encephalopathy.528 A Bacteroides strain modified to harbor a gene cluster conducive to using porphyrin has the capacity to colonize stably in mice with a porphyran-supplemented diet, which effectively confers a unique metabolic niche for the exogenous microbiome and presents a potential strategy to potentiate the efficacy of the target strain.524 Nevertheless, certain obstacles remain prior to the implementation of engineered bacterium therapy in clinical practice. As a form of gene therapy, the imminent risk is that the microbiome has the potential to transfer human genes to additional bacteria in the host, thus triggering unpredictable consequences. Additional evidence will emerge as the current set of clinical trials wraps up in the next few years.529

Individualized dietary modification is an ideal strategy to maintain healthy physiology in the host. HFD correlates with increased Alistipes, Prevotella, and reduced α-diversity,97,530 while a high-fiber diet is associated with enhanced butyrate-producing bacteria.527 The effects of additional dietary types on specific gut microbiomes have also received much attention. For example, a ketogenic diet (KD) emphasizes the consumption of very low CHO consumption (5 to 10% of total caloric intake) and is sufficient to enhance ketone production. KD was initially developed as a therapeutic intervention for refractory childhood epilepsy.531 The enrichment of Akkermansia and Parabacteroides associated with KD can mediate neuroprotective and anti-seizure effects.532,533 A high salt diet potentially worsens colitis in mice and accelerates the occurrence of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, which is associated with alterations in gut immune homeostasis and gut microbiome composition, including a reduced relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio.279,534 Such alterations have also been revealed to exert impacts on the immune response and metabolism in mice and humans. Considering these results, dietary modulation represents an additional avenue through which cancer treatment can be improved.181,535

A promising role of prebiotics in inhibiting cancers in a microbiome-dependent manner has been consistently demonstrated across studies of animal models. For example, administration of inulin-type fructans participates in restoring the gut microbiome and AMP expression, thereby leading to prolonged survival and subdued cancer proliferation and cachexia in leukemia mice.518 In another mouse model with liver cancer receiving inulin-type fructans (ITFs), the proliferation of liver cancer cells is counteracted through ITF-fermented propionate generation.539 Astoundingly, long-term consumption of dietary soluble fibers (such as inulin, pectin, and fructooligosaccharide) that have long been regarded as “prebiotics,” actually triggers cholestasis and icteric HCC in 40% of T5KO dysbiotic mice as well as in additional dysbiotic mice model deficiency in TLR4 or NLRC4. Furthermore, such HCC is not observed in GF- or antibiotic-treated mice but can be transmissible to healthy WT mice. The depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria or inhibition of gut fermentation results in a significant reduction in gut SCFA and protection against such HCC, revealing that gut dysbiosis exerts a decisive role in the onset and development of HCC.32 Therefore, in the context of gut dysbiosis, long-term supplementation of inulin or/and butyrate potentially leads to a more disconcerting microbial composition and function that confers a hazard to the health of the host. Although this study was conducted in mice and failed to be directly analogized to humans, it indeed backs up the underlying implications that, in patients with gut dysbiosis, enrichment of foods with prebiotic fibers may be unsound due to their dysregulated fermentation. Single prebiotics fail to provide metabolic benefits for the balanced growth of the overall intestinal community. The conditions that determine whether prebiotics play a beneficial or detrimental part in the host may partly depend on particular application scenarios and the real demand of customers. Further studies are warranted to comprehensively analyze the pleiotropic impacts of prebiotics on the host.

The intricate and diverse characteristics of the gut microbiome enable it to be an appealing target for therapeutic manipulation in diverse settings. The microbiome exerts effects on the host—in particular, it profoundly influences tumorigenesis and the development of various tumors through microbiome-derived metabolites or via direct modulation of immune and metabolism in the host. Elevating our understanding of how the microbiome and its metabolites affect host immunity will advance our capacity to provide well-founded microbial-based therapeutics.
