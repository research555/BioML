Gut dysbiosis is associated with poorer long-term prognosis in cirrhosis







Gut dysbiosis is common in cirrhosis.

To study the influence of gut dysbiosis on prognosis in cirrhosis.

The case-control study included 48 in-patients with cirrhosis and 21 healthy controls. Stool microbiome was assessed using 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequencing. We used modified dysbiosis ratio (MDR): [Bacilli (%) + Proteobacteria (%)]/[Clostridia (%) + Bacteroidetes (%)]. Patients with MDR more the median made up the group with severe dysbiosis, others did the group with non-severe dysbiosis. The follow-up period was 4 years.

The mortality rate of patients with severe dysbiosis was significantly higher than that of patients with non-severe dysbiosis (54.2% vs 12.5%; P = 0.001). The presence of severe dysbiosis was independent risk factors for death [hazard ratio = 8.6 × (1.9-38.0); P = 0.005]. The abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (P = 0.002), Proteobacteria (P = 0.002), and Lactobacillaceae (P = 0.025) was increased and the abundance of Firmicutes (P = 0.025) and Clostridia (P = 0.045) was decreased in the deceased patients compared with the survivors. The deceased patients had a higher MDR value than the survivors [0.131 × (0.069-0.234) vs 0.034 × (0.009-0.096); P = 0.004]. If we applied an MDR value of 0.14 as the cutoff point, then it predicted patient death within the next year with a sensitivity of 71.4% and a specificity of 82.9% [area under the curve = 0.767 × (0.559-0.974)]. MDR was higher in patients with cirrhosis than in health controls [0.064 × (0.017-0.131) vs 0.005 × (0.002-0.007); P < 0.001], and in patients with decompensated cirrhosis than in patients with compensated cirrhosis [0.106 × (0.023-0.211) vs 0.033 × (0.012-0.074); P = 0.031]. MDR correlated negatively with prothrombin (r = -0.295; P = 0.042), cholinesterase (r = -0.466; P = 0.014) and serum albumin (r = -0.449; P = 0.001) level and positively with Child–Turcotte–Pugh scale value (r = 0.360; P = 0.012).

Core Tip: The mortality rate of patients with severe dysbiosis was significantly higher than that of patients with non-severe dysbiosis. The abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, Proteobacteria, and Lactobacillaceae was increased and the abundance of Firmicutes and Сlostridia was decreased in the deceased patients compared with survivors. The abundance of Bacilli, Enterococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae was higher and the abundance of Clostridia was lower in those who died during the first year of follow-up compared with those who survived this year. The abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Proteobacteria was higher in those who died in 2nd-4th years of follow-up compared with survivors.

Microbiota are stable ecological communities of microorganisms in certain habitats[1]. Recently, the human microbiota has attracted the attention of researchers. Previous studies have shown that its composition varies in different diseases, and it has been hypothesized that the pathology of the human microbiota (dysbiosis) can participate in the pathogenesis of these diseases[2].

Identifying a solution to these two problems is the aim of the present research.

We used the CDR as a basis but flipped the equation such that the “bad” bacteria were in the numerator and the “good” bacteria were in the denominator. Therefore, our modified dysbiosis ratio (MDR) increased with aggravation of dysbiosis, which was less confusing in its interpretation. We considered Proteobacteria and Bacilli as “bad” bacteria since they are responsible for bacterial translocation as well as the development of secondary infections[3,8-10] and their contents increase in cirrhosis[4,5]. We used the dominant taxa in healthy individuals, Clostridia and Bacteroidetes, as “good” bacteria. These taxa are strict anaerobes; therefore, they do not undergo bacterial translocation and do not cause extraintestinal secondary infections in cirrhosis[3,8-10]. Clostridia predominate in the American population, where the Western diet is widespread, whereas Bacteroidetes are more common in the Asian population, where the Eastern diet is widespread[4,5]. Thus, the total accounting of these taxa is also intended to reduce the effect of diet on the value of the MDR. The abundance of Clostridia has been found to decrease with the development of cirrhosis[4,5]. The changes in Bacteroidetes abundance in cirrhosis appear to vary across different studies[4-6].

Thus, the pathogenesis- and evidence-based MDR was calculated as follows: [Bacilli (%) + Proteobacteria (%)]/[Clostridia (%) + Bacteroidetes (%)].

In this case-control prospective study, 113 consecutive patients with cirrhosis were admitted to the Department of Hepatology of Clinic for Internal Diseases, Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Sechenov University (Moscow, Russia) and screened for inclusion. The study procedures were explained to potential participants, and written informed consent was obtained before enrollment. The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sechenov University in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (№03-16).

The severity of liver disease was determined using the Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) scoring system[11], in which class A was defined as compensated cirrhosis and classes B and C were defined as decompensated cirrhosis.

The morning after admission, a stool sample was taken into a sterile disposable container and immediately frozen at -80 °C[12].

After amplification, the PCR product was purified using AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, United States). Then, a second round of PCR was performed to attach specific adapters and enable multiplexing of the samples. To begin, 5 μL of the first PCR product was added to the reaction after ball cleaning with primers containing Illumina indices (Nextera XT Index v2 Primers; San Diego, CA, United States) and adapter sequences as well as 2 × KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix. The amplification products were also purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). The concentrations of the prepared libraries were then measured using a Qubit 2.0 fluorimeter (London, United Kingdom) and quantitative PCR. The quality of the libraries was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA, United States). The libraries were mixed in equal proportions and diluted to the required concentration to be run on a MiSeq (Illumina) device. Pair-end readings of 300 + 300 nucleotides were obtained. Reads were trimmed from the 3’-tail with Trimmomatic (Illumina) and then merged into a single amplicon with the MeFiT tool[13,14]. We did not perform operational taxonomic unit picking; instead, we classified amplicon sequences with the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier and RDP database[15].

The patients were contacted by phone every 3 mo to confirm that they were alive. If there was no answer, we contacted the patient’s relatives by phone to find out if the patient was alive or dead. If it was not possible to contact them, we studied patient electronic medical records in the United Medical Information and Analytical System of Moscow, in which death registration data are entered. The follow-up period was 4 years.

Statistical analysis was performed with STATISTICA 10 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, United States) and SPSS Statistics (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, United States) software. The data are presented as medians (interquartile ranges). Differences between continuous variables were assessed with the Mann-Whitney test because many variables were not distributed normally. Fisher’s exact test was used to assess the differences between categorical variables. Survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox regression test. A Cox regression model was constructed to assess the influence of various factors on patient survival and hazard ratios (HRs). Correlations between variables were computed using Spearman’s rank correlation. P values ≤ 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.

Participants with cirrhosis and healthy controls were comparable in age [51 (40-59) vs 46 (42-54) years; Р = 0.489], body mass index [24.6 × (22.7-27.7) vs 26.3 × (25.1-29.0) kg/m2; Р = 0.110], and sex distribution (male/female: 23/25 vs 8/13; Р = 0.313).

If we used a CDR value of 15 as the cutoff point, then it predicted patient death within the next 4 years with a sensitivity of 68.8% and a specificity of 62.5% [AUC = 0.684 × (0.522-0.845); Figure

Translating scientific developments into clinical practice is a rather difficult task. The study of the gut microbiome in various diseases is becoming mainstream in modern science, but thus far, it has no applications in clinical practice. It is hindered by the high cost of sequencing the fecal microbiome and the shortage of bioinformatics specialists.

New studies are needed to evaluate how various methods (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, and fecal transplantation) can correct dysbiosis by analyzing the MDR and how this correction can improve the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis.

In conclusion, we were able to improve the CDR as well as show that gut dysbiosis is associated with poor prognosis in cirrhosis. Thus, we have developed a methodological apparatus and scientific basis for the correction of gut dysbiosis in such patients.

Gut dysbiosis is common in cirrhosis.

The aim is to study the influence of gut dysbiosis on prognosis in cirrhosis.

The objectives include the development and test of a modified dysbiosis ratio (MDR) to distinguish between patients with cirrhosis and healthy controls, patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, deceased and surviving patients.

The case-control study included 48 in-patients with cirrhosis and 21 healthy controls. Stool microbiome was assessed using 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequencing. We used MDR: [Bacilli (%) + Proteobacteria (%)]/[Clostridia (%) + bacteroidetes (%)]. Patients with MDR more its median made up the group with severe dysbiosis, others did the group with non-severe dysbiosis. The follow-up period was 4 years.

The mortality rate of patients with severe dysbiosis was significantly higher than that of patients with non-severe dysbiosis. The presence of severe dysbiosis was independent risk factors for death. The deceased patients had a higher MDR value than the survivors. MDR was higher in patients with cirrhosis than in health controls and in patients with decompensated cirrhosis than in patients with compensated cirrhosis.

Gut dysbiosis is associated with a poorer long-term prognosis in cirrhosis.

A larger study involving non-included patient populations should be provided to confirm the findings. New studies are needed to evaluate how various methods (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, and fecal transplantation) can correct dysbiosis by analyzing the MDR and how this correction can improve the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis.
