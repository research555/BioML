Ketogenic Diet: A Dietary Intervention via Gut Microbiome Modulation for the Treatment of Neurological and Nutritional Disorders (a Narrative Review)

The ketogenic diet (KD) has been important in treating epilepsy since the 1920s. The benefits of KD further expanded to other neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s diseases, autism spectrum disorder, and nutritional disorder (obesity). Although the therapeutic efficacy of KD has been generally accepted, there is limited knowledge about its underlying mechanism of action, particularly its effect on our gut microbiome. Gut dysbiosis has been proposed to be involved in those diseases, and KD can promote gut microbiota remodeling that may assist in recovery. This review explores the therapeutic applications of KD, the roles of the gut microbiome in neurological diseases and obesity, as well as the effect of KD on the gut microbiome. The present information suggests that KD has significant roles in altering the gut microbiome to improve disease symptoms, mainly by incrementing Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes (B/F) ratio and reducing Proteobacteria in certain cases. However, current gaps call for continued research to understand better the gut microbiota profile altered by KD.

The ketogenic diet (KD) was first introduced by Dr. Russel Wilder in 1921 and is characterized by a high fat, moderate protein, and a low carbohydrate diet [1]. The classic KD is based on a gold standard ratio of fats to a combination of proteins and carbohydrates in 4:1 [1,2]. In this dietary plan, fat contributes 90% of calories, while protein and carbohydrate give 6% and 4% calories, respectively [3]. This dietary approach was extensively used for treating epilepsy before antiepileptic agents were introduced in 1938 [1]. Eventually, various forms of less restrictive ketogenic diets (KDs), including medium-chain triglyceride diet, modified Atkins diet, and low glycaemic index treatment, with different fat to protein to carbohydrate ratios, have been introduced to accommodate the diverse lifestyles and for improved tolerance [4].

Meanwhile, KD significantly impacts gut microbiota, leading to changes in metabolite levels and mediating therapeutic effects [8]. The gut microbiome is vital in affecting health and diseases [9,10,11,12]. Diet or diet-based therapies (e.g., KD and low FODMAP diet) are among the most vital modifiable factors regulating the gut microbiome composition [13]. Our enteric nervous system acts as our second brain, which depends on serotonin neurotransmitters similar to our central nervous system. The brain–gut axis communicates bi-directionally, in which the intestinal microbiota is likely to influence neurotransmission in the central nervous system and vice versa [14]. Since the therapeutic dietary plan can affect microbial composition and diversity, targeting the gut microbiome could potentially help treat diseases and enhance overall health. Recently, the advantages of the KD have been expanded from epilepsy to other neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and autism spectrum disorder, and nutritional disorders such as obesity [15,16]. Additionally, increasing evidence suggests that gut microbiome dysbiosis is associated with the pathophysiology of epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, autism spectrum disorder, and obesity [17]. Hence, it is anticipated that KD could render beneficial effects by improving and restoring the gut microbiome to a premorbid state. The present review aims to explore the recent therapeutic applications of the KD. This review will also discuss the effects of KD on the modulation of gut microbiome composition and the potential mechanisms that contributed to the therapeutic outcomes.

The effectiveness of KD in treating epilepsy in children has been demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial conducted by Neal et al. (2008) [18]. In the trial, 54 epileptic children allocated to the KD group showed a clinically significant reduction by 75% in the mean percentage of baseline seizures compared to the 49 epileptic children in the control group three months after diet intervention. KD has also proven to be effective in adults; a study involving 23 individuals with epilepsy demonstrated 39% of them achieved ≥50% reduced seizure frequency, 22% of them showed <50% reduction or inconsistently ≥50% decrease in seizure frequency [19].

In addition, animal model studies have been conducted to explore the mechanisms behind KD on modulation of the gut microbiome. A mice model experiment demonstrated that KD induced a vital modification in the gut microbiome, mainly causing an increase in abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Parabacteroides spp., with reduced alpha diversity. These modifications of the gut microbiome resulted in changes at the metabolite level, particularly the reduction in gamma-glutamyl amino acid in the colon lumen and blood, accompanied by the rise in the GABA to glutamate ratio in the brain leading to the protection against 6 Hz seizures and reduction in the spontaneous seizure in Kcna1 knockout mice mimicking epilepsy. Furthermore, they depleted the gut microbiota by using mice reared germ-free or providing antibiotics to determine the importance of gut microbiota in affecting the seizure. Consequently, the mice with depleted gut microbiota exhibit decreased seizure threshold even with the introduction of KD. However, the seizure threshold increased when antibiotic-treated mice fed with KD were administered Akkermansia muciniphila and Parabacteroides merdae [8] (Table 1). In general, the findings of this study suggest that gut microbiota indeed play an important role in seizure protection in addition to KD.

Alzheimer’s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, is the most common type of dementia. The cause is poorly understood, and there is no cure and lack of effective treatment or preventative strategies for this devastating disorder [27,28]. Thus far, Alzheimer’s disease can only be diagnosed clinically and confirmed pathologically by detecting amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of tau proteins. Research has been revolving around investigating the role of β-amyloid peptides in regard to the development and prevention of this disease [27]. The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease consist of the accumulation of senile amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. β-amyloid peptides are commonly found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in which a higher percentage of them are identified as amyloid-β 40 (Aβ40) and a small percentage of them are amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42) [29,30]. Aβ42 could aggregate and deposit in the brain, causing the development of senile amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s patients. As a result, Aβ42 levels are lower in CSF of Alzheimer’s patients [29].

The gut microbiota composition could potentially contribute to the underlying aetiology of Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, manipulating the gut microbiome composition might influence cerebral amyloid deposition leading to prospective intervention for this disease. Most studies have shown that KD or medium chain triglyceride improves cognitive performance in Alzheimer’s [35,36,37]. In recent years, the reported KD’s benefits include increasing Aβ42 in CSF, decreasing tau protein, and enhancing cerebral perfusion [37]. A clinical trial was conducted to investigate the effect of modified Mediterranean-KD (MMKD) versus American Heart Association Diet (AHAD) on gut microbiota composition in subjects with preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease [38]. The study concluded that there was no significant difference in baseline microbiome diversity between participants with or without mild cognitive impairment at risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Nevertheless, patients in the mildly cognitive impaired group had higher levels of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, and lower levels of Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia than that of cognitively normal counterparts. When they probed into the effect on gut microbiota after 6 weeks of MMKD, they discovered that MMKD did no exert significant changes on Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria in both cognitive normal and mild cognitive impaired groups. Nonetheless, there were several changes at the family and genus levels after MMKD, for example, a significant decrease in Bifidobacterium (phylum Actinobacteria) was clearly observed in mild cognitive impaired group, and this effect was greater than AHAD (Figure 1). In addition to microbial composition, organic fecal acids such as lactate and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were correlated with changes in CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease. MMKD reduced lactate levels and increased propionate and butyrate SCFAs that could exert positive effects on peripheral and central nervous systems. Above all, the MMKD was associated with decreased gene families annotated to Alzheimer’s disease as predicted by bioinformatics tool [38]. Hence, diet intervention such as KD has the potential to modulate the gut microbiome composition and metabolites that could help improve symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.

Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disability affecting children, predominantly in boys rather than girls, and it is recognized by persistent social communication difficulties with repetitive and restrictive behaviors [39]. Several studies have attempted to decipher the connection between the gut microbiome and autism spectrum disorder. Meanwhile, some studies proposed the important role of diet in the clinical manifestation of autism spectrum disorder through modulating the gut microbiome [39,40,41]. According to De Angelis et al., the gut microbiota of autistic children exhibited a higher abundance of Bacteroidetes and a lower abundance of Firmicutes. At the bacterial genus level, Clostridium, Caloramater and Sarcina were predominantly higher, while Bifidobacterium was more deficient in autistic children [42] (Table 1). Moreover, Kandeel et al., 2020 demonstrated the correlation between intestinal Clostridium spp. and autism. The study reported increased colonization of these bacteria in autism spectrum disorder children. In particular, Clostridium difficile (now reclassified as Clostridioides difficile) and Clostridium clostridioforme (now reclassified as Enterocloster clostridioformis) were only presented in the gut of autistic children, while Clostridium tertium only presented in the gut of healthy control children [43]. Therefore, there is a possible correlation between intestinal Clostridia colonization and the exacerbation and development of autism spectrum disorder.

There is limited research on the effect of KD in modulating the gut microbiome of autistic individuals. Despite that, animal model studies have shown promising evidence that KD alters the growth of certain gut bacterial populations, which may indirectly affect autism symptoms. A murine study by Newell et al. showed that KD increased the F/B ratio in autism spectrum disorder mimicking BTBR mice [48] (Table 1; Figure 1). Following that, the KD also helped to normalize the initially elevated Akkermansia muciniphila population in BTBR mice. This bacterium is thought to correlate positively with autism spectrum disorder [42]. It is noteworthy that the total host bacterial abundance was also decreased by 78% in cecum and 28% in feces of BTBR mice after being given KD. This suggested that KD consumption resulted in changes in gut microbiome composition and thus, acknowledged the KD’s promising ability to counteract the common autism spectrum disorder phenotype of low F/B ratio [48]. In another study, BTBR mice fed with KD were proven to improve communication and sociability and reduce self-directed repetitive behavior [49]. Even so, further research is still needed to evaluate the role of KD in altering human gut microbiota composition to confer health benefits in autism patients.

KD has been one of the tailored diet regimens to assist in effective weight loss for obese individuals. Obesity is strongly associated with chronic metabolic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases [50]. The pathogenesis of obesity is due to an energy imbalance, accompanied by other factors, including the composition of our gut microbiome [51,52].

KD can effectively reduce up to 14% in weight, waist circumference, and BMI, with or without the addition of a symbiotic. This therapeutic dietary plan also modified the gut microbiota by increasing microbial diversity. The proportion of Proteobacteria was reduced while the proportion of Firmicutes was raised with KD. Furthermore, the bacterial families that decreased in abundance were Enterobacteriaceae, Sinobacteraceae, and Comamonadaceae, whereas those that increased in abundance were Ruminococcaceae and Mogibacteriaceae. Moreover, the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes (B/F) ratio increases along with the higher percentage of weight loss [59] (Table 1). Basciani et al. also concluded that overall Bacteroidetes increased in abundance, whilst Firmicutes decreased in abundance over 45 days of very-low calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKDs), incorporating whey, vegetable, or animal proteins. When comparing the type of proteins incorporated in KD, the whey or vegetable proteins were more effective in diminishing the abundance of Firmicutes than animal protein. Obesity and insulin resistance patients on KD achieved significant weight loss and improved metabolic parameters, including blood pressure, blood glucose, and cholesterol [60] (Table 1). Ang et al. conducted a study on obese (non-diabetics) patients who had shown that after the course of KD, there was a significant increase in abundance of Bacteroidetes with decreased abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria [61] (Table 1). These results are in agreement with the findings that obese individuals had a higher abundance of Firmicutes and a lower Bacteroidetes, and KD could alter the gut microbiome composition by decreasing the abundance of Firmicutes and increasing the abundance of Bacteroidetes to restore the balance of the gut ecosystem (Figure 1) [53,61,62].

The utilization of KD as a therapeutic regime has grown in popularity for various diseases, including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, autism spectrum disorder, and obesity. To date, there are no standard guidelines regarding application of KD for physical and mental illnesses. Nonetheless, Kraeuter et al. suggested the best practices of KD for implementation in preclinical and clinical studies [63]. The growing significance of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of these diseases has implicated that manipulating gut microbiota through dietary intervention such as KD could provide unprecedented opportunities to attenuate, treat or prevent these diseases in the near future [64,65,66].

Furthermore, it is crucial to address the potential adverse effects of consuming a KD. For example, the risk of gastrointestinal effects (constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, pancreatitis, hepatitis), electrolyte imbalances (hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia), metabolic dysfunction (hyperuricemia, transient hyperlipidemia) [79,80,81]. Prolonged effects include vitamin deficiency, osteopenia, neurological dysfunction, atherosclerosis, hepatotoxicity, nephrolithiasis, and anemia. Impaired sense of smell and taste, early satiety, dysphagia have been reported in patients with neurocognitive disorder after consuming KD [80]. The adjustment in food intake might trigger other health complications since these populations were at higher risk for malnutrition. Hence, it is necessary to examine the safety profile and consult a licensed nutritionist before implementing KD as a therapeutic diet [63].

The gut microbiome composition has been proposed to be one of the factors contributing to the pathogenesis of neurological and nutritional diseases, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, autism spectrum disorder, and obesity. As diet is a vital modifiable factor that regulates gut microbiome composition, implementing KD could produce therapeutic outcomes. Studies have demonstrated that KD could confer health benefits to individuals with epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, autism spectrum disorder, or obesity. KD alleviated the disease symptoms, and this could be associated with the alteration of the gut microbiome. KD potentially decreases the intestinal colonization of Proteobacteria that associated with pro-inflammatory responses. Additionally, KD increases B/F ratio which particularly benefits obese individuals and increases the levels of other beneficial intestinal microbes such as Prevotella. However, there are still insufficient studies to deduce the effect of KD on gut microbiome modulation, and more evidence is required to evaluate its effectiveness as a therapeutic diet. The inconsistency in the changes of gut microbial composition and diversity by KD also warrants further investigation. Future studies with a larger sample size and longer KD courses are recommended to examine the effects of KD on gut microbiome modulation and the associated therapeutic implications. It is also critical to monitor the long-term beneficial effects and potential adverse events of KD.
