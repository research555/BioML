Gut Microbiome-Derived Uremic Toxin Levels in Hemodialysis Patients on Different Phosphate Binder Therapies

Constipation is prevalent in patients with kidney failure partly due to the use of medication, such as phosphate binders. We hypothesized that serum levels of gut microbiome-derived uremic toxins (UTOX) may be affected by the choice of phosphate binder putatively through its impact on colonic transit time. We investigated two commonly prescribed phosphate binders, sevelamer carbonate (SEV) and sucroferric oxyhydroxide (SFO), and their association with gut microbiome-derived UTOX levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients.

Weekly blood samples were collected from 16 anuric HD participants during the 5-week observational period. All participants were on active phosphate binder monotherapy with either SFO or SEV for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Eight UTOX (7 gut microbiome-derived) and tryptophan were quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Serum phosphorus, nutritional, and liver function markers were also measured. For each substance, weekly individual levels, the median concentration per participant, and differences between SFO and SEV groups were reported. Patient-reported bowel movements, by the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS), and pill usage were assessed weekly.

The SEV group reported a 3.3-fold higher frequency of BSS stool types 1 and 2 (more likely constipated, p < 0.05), whereas the SFO group reported a 1.5-fold higher frequency of BSS stool types 5–7 (more likely loose stool and diarrhea, not significant). Participants in the SFO group showed a trend toward better adherence to phosphate binder therapy (SFO: 87.6% vs. SEV: 66.6%, not significant). UTOX, serum phosphorus, nutritional and liver function markers, and tryptophan were not different between the two groups.

There was no difference in the gut microbiome-derived UTOX levels between phosphate binders (SFO vs. SEV), despite SFO therapy resulting in fewer constipated participants. This pilot study may inform study design of future clinical trials and highlights the importance of including factors beyond bowel habits and their association with UTOX levels.

The loss of kidney function in kidney failure patients is accompanied by the retention of a host of metabolites [1]. Many of these uremic retention solutes have been shown to negatively affect the functioning of cells and organs, resulting in the uremic syndrome [2]. Some of these uremic toxins (UTOX) are derived from colon microbes [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Gut microbiome dysbiosis − changes in composition and function of the gut microbiome − is common in kidney failure patients. One contributing factor to gut dysbiosis is the change of gastrointestinal tract environment by the influx of urea, uric acid, and oxalate from the blood into the gut. A previous study revealed that the dominant microbiota in kidney failure patients are families expressing urease, urate oxidase, and p-cresol- and indole-forming enzymes [8]. These enzymes generate metabolites that are subsequently absorbed into the blood and, in some cases, further metabolized into UTOX in the liver. Some toxins are highly protein-bound and thus are inefficiently removed by conventional hemodialysis (HD) treatment [9]. Their accumulation in kidney failure patients may contribute to systemic inflammation and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression [10, 11, 12]. Further, elevated levels of these protein-bound UTOX have been associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [13]. However, it is important to acknowledge that to date no causal relationship between colon-derived UTOX and poor clinical outcomes has been established.

We hypothesized that serum levels of gut microbiome-derived UTOX may be affected by the choice of phosphate binder putatively through its impact on colonic transit time. This hypothesis was built on two observations: (a) clinically, SEV induces constipation, while SFO causes transient diarrhea [15]; (b) colonic transit time impacts the generation of gut-derived UTOX as longer colonic transit time is associated with higher UTOX levels [7].

The study presented here is a multicenter, 6-week observational study conducted at 4 HD clinics in New York, NY, USA. The inclusion criteria were kidney failure patients on thrice weekly HD regimen, ≥18 years of age at the time of informed consent, and on active phosphate binder monotherapy with either SFO or SEV for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Seventeen study participants were enrolled from September 2018 to March 2019 with no follow-up afterward. The exclusion criterion was inability to maintain diary to track binder usage and bowel movements. Sixteen study participants completed all study visits; 1 patient was withdrawn due to relocation (Fig.
1). All study participants were anuric and treated with polysulfone dialyzers.

Study participants were seen on a scheduled mid-week treatment day once a week for 6 consecutive weeks. An interview was administered in the first week, which included study participants' binder prescription and bowel habits. In the subsequent 5 weeks, predialysis blood samples were collected to measure UTOX and other biomarkers related to phosphate binder therapy, nutritional status, and liver function. Seven gut-derived UTOX were selected to test the hypothesis: trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), indoxyl glucuronide (IG), phenylacetylglutamine (PAG), IS, 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionic acid (CMPF), PCS, and hippuric acid (HA; derived from both the gut microbiome and mammalian sources). For comparison, we also measured mammalian-derived kynurenic acid (KYNA) and nutritional marker tryptophan (TRP). A weekly diary was provided to the study participants to capture phosphate binder usage and bowel movements. Satisfaction and frequency of bowel movements along with stool consistency, determined by Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) [20], were assessed to indicate the bowel habit for each patient. On the BSS, types 1 and 2 were considered as likely constipated, types 5–7 as likely loose stool or diarrhea, and types 3 and 4 were regarded as normal. Bowel satisfaction was evaluated using a numeric scale from 1 (unsatisfactory) to 10 (completely satisfactory). The adherence to phosphate binder therapy was determined by weekly pill counts. The adherence was calculated as the percentage of the actual number (pill count) to the expected number (prescription) of pills consumed. UTOX levels, phosphate binder usage and bowel habits, were analyzed until March 2021. All study procedures were approved by Western Institutional Review Board® (Protocol number: #20181972) and performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The signed written informed consent forms were obtained from all participants for this study.

Serum was aliquoted and stored at −80°C until analysis. For UTOX and TRP analysis, samples were prepared according to Dunn et al. [21] with some modifications. Briefly, 50 µL serum was spiked with 25 µL internal standard cocktail consisting of [D9]-trimethylamine N-oxide, [13C6]-IS, and [D7]-PCS (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Tewksbury, MA, USA). Aliquots of serum from each participant were combined and served as quality control samples. An external standard curve for each substance of interest quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was prepared in 4% human serum albumin. Samples were extracted with 150 µL ice-cold methanol followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 4,300 rpm and 4°C. The supernatant was dried down using a centrifugal vacuum evaporator without heating and dried extracts were resuspended in 0.01% formic acid and 1 mM ammonium formate for LC-MS analysis.

Serum phosphate, nutritional markers, and liver enzymes were analyzed using a Pentra C400 biochemistry analyzer (Horiba, Irvine, CA). UTOX and TRP levels were analyzed using a 1290 Infinity II high-performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a 6545 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). UTOX and TRP were separated on a reverse-phase column (Luna C18 4.6 × 150 mm, 3 µm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) at a flow rate of 0.75 mL/min. The gradient mobile phase consisted of mobile phase A (0.01% formic acid and 1 mM ammonium formate in water) and mobile phase B (0.01% formic acid and 1 mM ammonium formate in methanol). The gradient started at 1% mobile phase B, which was changed linearly over the next 6.5 min until reaching 40%. Over the next 1.5 min, the percentage was increased linearly to 90% followed by a linear increase to 100% over 3.5 min, where it was kept for 0.5 min. The mobile-phase composition was allowed to return to the initial conditions, which were held for 3 min to equilibrate the column. The following MS parameters were used: m/z 50–1,000, gas temperature 350°C, drying gas 12 L/min, nebulizer 35 psig, sheath gas temperature 400°C, sheath gas flow 12 L/min, fragmentor 125 V and 175 V, skimmer 65 V, Oct 1 RF Vpp 750 V, VCap 4,000 V, and Nozzle Voltage 500 V for positive mode; VCap 2,000 V and Nozzle Voltage 2,000 V for negative mode. A standard curve consisting of 5 levels for UTOX and TRP was used to calculate accuracy and precision for 3 quality control samples measured in triplicates at low, mid, and high concentrations of UTOX and TRP.

Descriptive statistics including measures of central tendency (mean, median) and spread (standard deviation, interquartile range) for continuous variables and number and frequency for categorical variables were compiled. For each UTOX, TRP, and routine clinical diagnostic biomarkers, we calculated the median concentration per participant and then the median across all participants within each group. We also reported the differences in median serum concentrations between the treatment groups. A mixed-effects model was employed to investigate UTOX levels between different binder therapies (SEV vs. SFO) during the observational period (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups regarding sex, age, race, body mass index, comorbidities, dialysis vintage, adherence to binder therapy, duration of phosphate binder treatment, Kt/V, and normalized protein catabolic rate (Table
1). Pill burden was lower in the SFO group versus the SEV group (mean 2.6 vs. 6.4, respectively). Simultaneous lanthanum carbonate intake was recorded for 1 patient in the SEV group. The SEV group reported a 3.3-fold higher frequency of stool types 1 and 2 (more likely constipated, p < 0.05), whereas the SFO group reported a trend toward a 1.5-fold higher frequency of stool types 5–7 (more likely loose stool and diarrhea, not significant) (Fig.
2). When scoring bowel habit satisfaction on a scale from 1 (unsatisfactory) to 10 (completely satisfactory), patients in the SFO group showed a trend toward higher scores than the SEV group (7.1 vs. 5.5, respectively). Individual phosphate levels, nutritional markers, such as normalized protein catabolic rate, albumin and total protein, liver function markers, and total and direct bilirubin were assessed over 5 weeks (Fig.
3; Table
1). Phosphate levels did not differ between the SEV and SFO groups (Table
2). Nutritional markers, such as albumin and total protein, liver function markers, and total and direct bilirubin were not different between the 2 groups (Table
2). A total of 9 substances were measured by LC-MS weekly over 5 weeks for each patient shown in Figure
4: 7 gut microbiome-derived UTOX (TMAO, IG, PAG, IS, CMPF, PCS, and HA), 1 mammalian-derived UTOX (KYNA), and 1 nutritional marker (TRP). UTOX and TRP levels did not differ between the SEV and SFO groups (Table
3; Fig.
4).

Our study investigated the effect of two widely prescribed phosphate binders, SEV and SFO, on gut microbiome-derived UTOX levels, putatively through its impact on colonic transit time. We discovered SFO therapy resulted in fewer constipated participants, and gut microbiome-derived UTOX levels were not different between the two groups. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to compare UTOX levels in HD patients on SFO or SEV in the same setting. Our pilot study could inform future studies, especially for power analysis and sample size estimation.

In conclusion, there was no difference in the serum gut microbiome-derived UTOX levels between phosphate binders (SFO vs. SEV), although SFO resulted in fewer constipated participants. Future interventional studies with a larger sample size may include factors beyond bowel habits and their role in affecting the UTOX levels.
