Distinct gut microbiomes in two polar bear subpopulations inhabiting different sea ice ecoregions

Gut microbiomes were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding for polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from the southern Beaufort Sea (SB), where sea ice loss has led to increased use of land-based food resources by bears, and from East Greenland (EG), where persistent sea ice has allowed hunting of ice-associated prey nearly year-round. SB polar bears showed a higher number of total (940 vs. 742) and unique (387 vs. 189) amplicon sequence variants and higher inter-individual variation compared to EG polar bears. Gut microbiome composition differed significantly between the two subpopulations and among sex/age classes, likely driven by diet variation and ontogenetic shifts in the gut microbiome. Dietary tracer analysis using fatty acid signatures for SB polar bears showed that diet explained more intrapopulation variation in gut microbiome composition and diversity than other tested variables, i.e., sex/age class, body condition, and capture year. Substantial differences in the SB gut microbiome relative to EG polar bears, and associations between SB gut microbiome and diet, suggest that the shifting foraging habits of SB polar bears tied to sea ice loss may be altering their gut microbiome, with potential consequences for nutrition and physiology.

Many metabolic and immune system processes of higher-order organisms are carried out by an assemblage of microbes—predominantly bacteria—found within their gastrointestinal systems1,2. Thus, the gut microbiome influences host nutrition, health, and resistance to enteric pathogenic diseases1,3,4. Although far less studied than those of human, laboratory, or domestic animals5, the gut microbiomes of many wild animal species have recently been characterized6. Many of these species host Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia as the major bacterial phyla1. Yet, differences in the species composition within phyla among host species appears to be the norm7. In mammalian wildlife, variation in bacterial community composition among host species has been attributed to a combination of host phylogeny, habitat, and diet2,8,9; however, diet appears to be a predominant driver of interspecific variation in gut bacterial community composition and of intraspecific variation10–12.

The distinct sea ice conditions that result in differing habitat use and feeding habits for EG and SB polar bears provides a unique opportunity to explore inter-population variation in the gut microbiota of a wild animal species and could provide insight into the ability of polar bears to cope with added environmental stressors introduced by climate change. Preliminary findings on the gut microbiota of a single polar bear subpopulation using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries detected just one phylum, Firmicutes, suggesting low gut bacterial diversity relative to other mammalian species28. However, more recently, 16S rRNA metataxonomics using Illumina technology approaches found 25 bacterial phyla in the SB subpopulation and greater gut bacterial diversity for bears that spend part of the year onshore and that likely have a more diverse terrestrial-based diet relative to bears remaining offshore with likely narrower diets consisting largely of ice seals29. In this study, we use high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing techniques to assess inter-population variation in gut microbial composition and diversity between EG and SB polar bears using samples collected during the same season (late-winter/early spring). We also explore how sex/age class, body mass (as an indicator of body condition), and (for SB bears) dietary patterns based on fatty acid (FA) signatures30, are associated with inter-and (for SB bears) intra-population variation in gut microbial communities in two wild polar bear subpopulations. Given the evidence of dietary alterations occurring in the SB subpopulation and the distinct ice ecoregion differences that force some SB polar bears to spend greater amounts of time on land, we predict that SB gut microbiota will be more diverse and that we will see a higher degree of interindividual variation and a greater number of overall and unique bacterial species in the SB subpopulation compared to EG. We also expect that diet will be a significant driver of both gut bacterial diversity and composition in the subset of SB polar bears for which FA data was available.

A total of 12,294,006 reads were obtained for both EG (n = 34) and SB (n = 59) samples combined, with an average of 81,960 reads per sample. Following DADA2 processing, 6,172 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were identified overall, which were then further reduced to 1129 ASVs after removing ASVs with less than two counts and zero variance across all samples.

A total of 742 ASVs were detected in EG polar bears and 940 ASVs were found for SB polar bears (Fig. 5B). Of the 553 shared ASVs, 48 differed significantly in their abundances between subpopulations (Supplementary Table S4). Significant differences in composition at the ASV level were found between subpopulations using both Bray–Curtis distances (PERMANOVA: R2 = 0.052, F1,93 = 5.20, p < 0.001) (Fig. 6A) and the phylogenetic Weighted UniFrac Distances (PERMANOVA: R2 = 0.065, F1,93 = 6.49, p = 0.001) (Fig. 6B). These results were not confounded by heterogeneity of subpopulation group dispersions (Bray–Curtis: PERMDISP: F1,93 = 0.75, p = 0.39; Weighted UniFrac: PERMDISP: F1,93 = 0.61, p = 0.44).

Neither sex/age class, body condition, nor any interaction terms significantly explained variation in Shannon and Inverse Simpson alpha diversity, although sex/age class was found to be a near-significant term in the linear model explaining variation in Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Fig. S2).

Significant differences in gut bacterial composition were found between polar bears of different sex/age classes (i.e. adult females [AF], adult males [AM], subadults [S], and cubs [C]) at the class (PERMANOVA: R2 = 0.076, F1,93 = 2.51, p = 0.004), genus (R2 = 0.079, F1,93 = 2.66, p < 0.001) and ASV-levels (Bray–Curtis distance: R2 = 0.081, F1,93 = 2.73, p < 0.001; Weighted UniFrac distance: R2 = 0.079, F1,93 = 2.53, p = 0.002) (Table
1, Supplementary Fig. S3). However, the assumption of homogeneity of multivariate group dispersions for the sex/age class groups was not met for either the Bray–Curtis or Weighted UniFrac indices at ASV-level (PERMDISP: p = 0.005 and p = 0.041, respectively), so results should be interpreted with some caution. Post-hoc ANCOMBC results showed that the abundances of three bacterial classes (Bacilli, Parcubacteria, and Saccharimonadia) (Supplementary Fig. S4), 21 bacterial genera and 65 ASVs differed significantly among the different sex/age class groups (Supplementary Tables S5, S6 and S7). There were no significant effects of body condition or any of the interaction terms at any taxonomic level (Table
1).

For a subset of SB polar bears (n = 46), diet data was obtained using fatty acid (FA) signature analysis. The proportions of key dietary FAs were used in a principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables from the fatty acids to just two principal components, which explained 83.3% of the total variation in polar bear FA signatures. Diet was represented in subsequent microbiome models by the individual’s scores along FA_PC1 and FA_PC2 (Supplementary Fig. S5). PERMANOVAs and multiple linear regression models were run to assess how diet influences gut bacterial diversity and composition, respectively. FA_PC1 was a significant term in models explaining variation in Shannon and Inverse Simpson indices of alpha diversity for these bears and FA_PC2 was also a nearly-significant term in the model explaining differences in composition (Table
2, Supplementary Table S8). Athough diet did not explain variation in gut bacterial composition at class-level, significant effects of diet (FA_PC1 and FA_PC2) were found at bacterial genus-level and ASV-levels (Table
3).

Similar to the analyses including both EG and SB subpopulations, sex/age class significantly explained variation in gut bacterial diversity and composition among SB polar bears (Tables
2,
3, see Supplementary Text 1). Additionally, body condition was found to be a nearly-significant term in the Shannon alpha diversity model and capture year was found to be a significant term in the model for the Bray–Curtis NMDS2 axis (Table
2, Supplementary Table S8). Capture year was also found to be a significant term in composition PERMANOVAs using Bray–Curtis distance method (Table
3). There were no significant terms in models explaining variation in the Weighted UniFrac NMDS axes (Table
2, Supplementary Table S8).

Polar bears from the SB subpopulation showed significant differences in gut bacterial composition at multiple bacterial taxonomic levels compared to EG polar bears and an overall greater number of unique and total bacterial genera and ASVs. The particular bacterial classes and genera which were elevated in one subpopulation versus the other were consistent with a potentially altered and more varied gut microbiota in the more land-associated SB subpopulation relative to the more sea ice-based EG subpopulation. Relative to SB polar bears, those in the EG subpopulation had higher levels of bacteria from the class Bacilli, which has been suggested to play an important role in restoring gut health and maintaining gut homeostasis31 and from the class Coriobacteria which is a typical taxonomic group found in the human gut and known to play a role in gut microbiome health32. Although many of the most abundant bacterial genera were shared between the two subpopulations, some genera were significantly higher in EG bears compared to SB bears. Specifically, Collinsella, Lactobacillus, Erysipelatoclostridium, and Escherichia-Shigella were higher in EG, and some of these genera have important probiotic properties, at least based on human studies33–36. Bacteria from class Coriobacteria (e.g. Collinsella) have been suggested to aid with lipid metabolism in human studies37 and with cholesterol metabolism in controlled studies on hamsters38. These differences could imply that EG bears have a healthier ‘baseline’ gut microbiome compared to SB bears, a reflection of their likely narrower dietary niche breadth and continued access to traditional lipid-rich prey species, however this is difficult to conclude given the lack of studies on functional roles of these bacteria in wildlife5. Alternatively, the differential bacterial classes and genera between SB and EG bears could simply reflect local regional adaptations based on differences in food availability and other geographic and ecosystem variables such as exposure to sea ice vs. terrestrial habitat, exposure to different macro- and micro- fauna, etc.

Overall, this study showed differences in gut composition and diversity between two geographically distant polar bear subpopulations facing distinct sea ice conditions and prey availability. The SB subpopulation showed more rare and unique ASVs and bacterial genera present compared to the EG subpopulation and indications of greater inter-individual diversity. These findings likely, in part, reflect the use of onshore foods for some members of the population during the reduced ice season62,95. This interpretation is supported by the SB subset results indicating diet and intraspecific variation among polar bear sex/age classes are likely linked, and are key drivers of alpha diversity and gut bacterial composition within the subpopulation, This study highlights the importance of considering both inter-population and inter-individual variation in gut bacterial composition, given the direct links between gut microbiota and host physiology, nutrition, and overall health96,97. Nonetheless, because there are many variables that influence the gut bacterial community, it can be challenging to assess the influence of each in isolation, or to make direct conclusions when certain factors are unavailable for assessment. Polar bears are facing a myriad of anthropogenic stressors posing threats to their continued survival as a species. Moving forward, assessing the impacts of such stressors on the gut microbiome will likely be an important aspect of monitoring polar bear health.

Fecal samples were collected from 34 EG polar bears in March–April of 2017 and from 59 SB polar bears in March–April of 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019 (Fig. 1). Polar bears were immobilized from a helicopter and tissue samples were collected as part of long-term population assessments in each region. Biometric measurements were recorded, including sex and body mass. Ages were quantitatively estimated via growth layer groups from a vestigial premolar tooth sampled on first capture98. Fecal samples were collected from the rectum of polar bears using sterile latex gloves placed in sterile whirlpak bags. Due to limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, only adipose tissue samples from SB polar bears could be shipped and analyzed for fatty acid-based assessment of diet. Adipose tissue biopsies were collected from 46 SB polar bears, representing a subset of the same SB individuals for which fecal samples were taken. Fecal and adipose samples were kept at -20 °C during the field season and then shipped on dry ice to McGill and stored at -80 °C prior to laboratory analysis. Samples were collected from SB polar bears as part of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Polar Bear Research Program (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Permit# MA690038 to T.C.A) under capture protocols approved by the USGS Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Samples were collected from EG polar bears under case nr. 2017-5446, document 4710596 from the Department of Fisheries and Hunting, as part of a long-term monitoring program by the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources.

Fecal samples were extracted in random order at McGill University according to the same procedures previously described for samples from 2009 to 2013 from the SB polar bear subpopulation29. Briefly, feces from the glove were swabbed with a sterile cotton-tipped applicator. Tips were transferred to a tube of 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), vortexed, and spun down after removing the cotton tip to obtain a pellet. After adding a stainless-steel bead (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany) and lysis buffer (see Watson et al.29), samples were homogenized at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. The extraction protocol then continued at step 2 of the QIAamp Mini Kit Buccal Swab Spin Protocol (QIAamp DNA Mini and Blood Mini Handbook). Samples were spun down in a final volume of 100 μL elution buffer (Buffer AE) and 30 μL of each extract was aliquoted among two 96-well plates to facilitate downstream PCR reaction setup. For each batch of extractions, a separate sterile swab control was run alongside samples as a blank and stored with corresponding samples on the same 96-well plate. All DNA extracts were stored at −20 °C until further analysis.

Gene amplification was performed as per previous analyses on SB polar bears29 with minor modifications. In brief, a ~ 460 base pair (bp) region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the universal bacterial primer set 341F (5′-CCTACGG GNGGCWGCAG-3′) and 805Rmod (5’-GACTACNVGGGTWTCTAATCC-3’) with overhanging Illumina adaptors. PCR reaction wells contained 6.5 μL of Rnase free H2O, 0.5 μL of 20 mg mL−1 BSA (bovine serum albumin), 1.5 μL of 10 μg μL−1 of both 341F and 805Rmod primers, 12.5 μL of 2X Kapa Hifi Hot Start Ready Mix (Roche Diagnostics), and 2.5 μL template DNA with PCR cycling conditions as described29. Amplified DNA was purified using AMPure beads (0.8 bead to sample ratio; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Illumina® Nextera XT indices and sequencing adaptors (Illumina®, San Diego, CA) were annealed to PCR product in a subsequent 8-cycle PCR run as specified in the Illumina® 16S Library Preparation guide and purified again using AMPure beads (1.12 bead to sample ratio). Final indexed samples and negative controls were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and pooled at 4 nM to create the final library, which was then characterized and validated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) confirming uniform amplicon size (~ 600 bp) before sequencing on a 2 × 250 bp paired-end run with v2 chemistry on an Illumina® MiSeq platform at McGill University.

The 46 SB adipose tissue biopsies were processed for FA signatures to provide insight into feeding patterns according to methods previously used for SB polar bears from 2004 to 201661,69. In short, lipids were extracted and then FAs were converted to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) using the Hilditch reagent. FAMEs within each sample were then separated and analyzed on an Agilent (Santa Clara, CA, USA) 8860 gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector and quantified using OpenLab CDS Data Analysis software (V. 2.5; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) as mass percent of total FAME. FAs were abbreviated according to their carbon chain length (A), number of double bonds (B), and position of the first double bond counting from the methyl end of the carbon chain (X) as A:BnX.

A principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted using selected FAs to reduce dimensionality of the diet data, and the significant PC axes were then used as explanatory variables in PERMANOVA and multiple linear regression models explaining variation in gut bacterial composition and diversity. Of the 70 marine-associated FAs that were detected and quantified, 30 FAs thought to be present in polar bear adipose tissue predominately due to dietary uptake and used in previous polar bear diet studies were initially selected21,99. We did not include 20:1n11, as it has recently been suggested that this FA may not be informative in delineating polar bear feeding patterns100. We further only included the major dietary FAs, or those comprising on average > 1% of total FAME, to reduce the possible influence on FA proportions related to instrumental analytical variation101. The final set of nine FAs allowed us to meet the recommended 5:1 sample to variable ratio for conducting PCA analysis102. Prior to PCA analysis, the FA proportions were log-ratio transformed as recommended to normalize the multivariate data102,103.

Unless stated otherwise, all analyses were performed using R 4.0.3104. Sequencing data was filtered, trimmed, de-replicated, and paired ends were merged using DADA2105. The inferred amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were taxonomically assigned using the SILVA reference database (version 132) as described in the DADA2 tutorial. Decontam106 was used to identify and filter out any contaminant ASVs, (i.e., those detected in both sample PCR negative controls and in extraction kit blanks). MicrobiomeAnalystR107 was then used to remove ASVs with less than 2 counts and zero variance and the resulting phyloseq object output was extracted and integrated into subsequent phyloseq108 and MicrobiomeAnalystR workflows107,108. All samples produced > 10,000 reads and so none were eliminated. As recommended, data rarefaction was not performed109.

Given that we only had FA signatures for SB polar bears, separate PERMANOVAs using the Bray–Curtis distance method (and post-hoc univariate tests, as appropriate) were also run to examine associations of bacterial composition with diet, using the significant PCs from the FA analysis (as described above), while also including sex/age class, body mass, and capture year (2016, 2017, and 2018). The sex/age classes used were adult female (AF, n = 16), adult male (AM, n = 24), and subadult (S, n = 6). Cubs are not included as adipose biopsies were not collected from this age class. Multiple linear regression models were run to test for ecological and dietary effects on gut bacterial alpha and beta diversity (represented by Bray–Curtis and Weighted UniFrac NMDS axes) indices for SB polar bears. Top models were selected using backwards model selection and Akaike information criterion (AIC) scores adjusted for smaller sample sizes114. The backwards model selection process was conducted via step-wise dropping of terms in the model and AIC calculation. If dropping a term decreased the AIC it was removed and this process repeated until removal of variables did not result in lowering of the AIC score of the overall model.
