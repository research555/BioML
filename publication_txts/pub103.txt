Sex-dependent impact of Roundup on the rat gut microbiome

A growing body of research suggests that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota induced by environmental pollutants, such as pesticides, could have a role in the development of metabolic disorders. We have examined the long-term effects of 3 doses of the Roundup(R) herbicide (made of glyphosate and formulants) on the gut microbiota in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. A total of 141 bacteria families were identified by a 16S sequencing analysis approach. An OPLS-DA analysis revealed an increased Bacteroidetes family S24-7 and a decreased Lactobacillaceae in 8 out of the 9 females treated with 3 different doses of R (n = 3, for each dose). These effects were confirmed by repetitive sequence-based PCR fingerprinting showing a clustering of treated females. A culture-based method showed that R had a direct effect on rat gut microbiota. Cultivable species showed different sensitivities to R, including the presence of a high tolerant or resistant strain identified as Escherichia coli by 16S rRNA sequencing. The high tolerance of this E. Coli strain was explained by the absence of the EPSPS gene (coding glyphosate target enzyme) as shown by DNA amplification. Overall, these gut microbiome disturbances showed a substantial overlap with those associated with liver dysfunction in other studies. In conclusion, we revealed that an environmental concentration of R (0.1 ppb) and other two concentrations (400 ppm and 5,000 ppm) have a sex-dependent impact on rat gut microbiome composition and thus warrants further investigation.

Human gut microbiome is inhabited by 1013 −1014 bacteria, more or less the same order as the number of human cells [1]. A growing body of research indicates that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is implicated in a wide range of clinical conditions, some of which develop local in intestine as could be anticipated such as inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer [2], with some others developing in distant organs being more surprising such as diabetes, obesity, asthma, liver and cardiovascular diseases, or even autism spectrum disorder [3]. A number of studies have indicated that changes in dietary patterns and lifestyle, as well as the presence of toxic food contaminants, can modulate the composition and the activity of the gut microbiome even if their role in the development of this disease is still poorly understood [4]. However, although human genetic variation in immune-related genes is correlated with gut microbiome composition [5], the recent rise of gut disease in Western industrialised countries cannot be fully explained by genetic drift in human populations and environmental factors plays a major role [6].

Historically, our knowledge about the microbiome in general and in the gut in particular was limited to cultivatable flora representing less than 1% of the total bacterial population. Meta-omics studies have a wide range of applications ranging from phylogeny to metabolomic studies [28]. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have allowed new and complete information on microbiome diversity. In this work we studied for the first time the long-term impact of Roundup (R) on the mammalian gut microbiome using two complementary approaches: (i) a new high-throughput 16S sequencing (IonTorrent®) phylogenic analysis of the microbiome from rats having received ad libitum water supplemented with different doses of R throughout 2-years (ii) traditional culture methods in order to study in-vitro short-term impacts of R on isolated gut bacterial strains.

The experimental protocol was conducted in accordance with the regulations of ethics in an animal care unit authorized by the French Ministries of Agriculture and Research (Agreement Number A35-288-1). Animal experiments were performed according to ethical guidelines of animal experimentations (CEE 86/609 regulation).

Feces samples were collected from rats which were part of a long-term study in which 3 doses of R (0.1 ppb, 400 ppm and 5000 ppm) had been administrated in tap water ad libitum [29]. The commercial GBH formulation used was R Grand Travaux Plus® (450 g/L glyphosate, approval 2020448; Monsanto, Belgium). The glyphosate concentration in drinking water, as well as the glyphosate stability during the 7 day period between two preparations of the test was confirmed by HPLC–MS/MS (corresponding to 50 ng/L, 0.1 g/L and 2.25 g/L of G respectively). The samples (n = 24) were collected after 673 days of R administration. They were kept at −80 °C. Samples were selected from independent cages as recommended [9] to avoid pre-clustering microbiota, and correspond to 3 females and 3 males per group, at the exception of two males treated with R 0.1 ppb which were housed together.

The 24 fecal samples were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing IonTorrent® in AdGène laboratory (Thury-Harcout, France) according to the manufactureŕs instructions. Samples were homogenized and 200 mg were treated with Nucleospin Tissue (Macherey Nagel, Hoerdt, France) for DNA extraction. DNA quantity was measured by spectrophotometer (Biophotometer, Eppendorf, Montesson, France). A total of 7 hyper variable zones (V2, V4, V8, V3, V6, V7 and V9) of 16S rRNA gene were amplified with the Ion 16™ Metagenomics Kit (Life Technologies, Saint-Aubin, France). The amplification was made with two sets of primers (V2-4-8 and V3-6,7-9). The results were controlled by capillary electrophoresis analyses using QIAxcel Advanced System (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Amplified DNAs were purified with the MinElute Purification Kit (Qiagen). Preparation of libraries was performed with the Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit (Life Technologies) and 4 samples were treated in each sequencing run using Ion Xpress Barcodes Adapters 1-16 and Ion Xpress Barcode Adapters 17-32 (Life Technologies). All libraries correspond to DNA fragments from 200 bp to 400 bp. Emulsion PCR was made with the Ion PGM™ Template OT2 400 Kit in OneTouch2, the enrichment of balls was realized in OneTouchES. Quality control was carried out with the Ion Sphere™ Quality Control Kit in Qubit 2.0 fluorometer. Sequencing was undertaken in the 316v2 microchip with Ion PGM Hi-Q Sequencing Kit on the ION PGM sequencer. All the corresponding raw data has been posted on the ENA database with the accession number ERP104935 (PRJEB23198).

A total of 72 fecal samples (coming from 24 rats, 3 samples each) were analyzed by (GTG)5-PCR. DNA was extracted as described above. DNA samples were further diluted 10 times to prevent any risk of saturation of the polymerase. The reaction mixes (25 μL) were prepared using 5 μL of template DNA, 0.4 μM concentration of primers (5′-GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG-3′) and 12.5 μL of DreamTaq PCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific). PCR amplifications were performed with an initial denaturation step (95 °C, 3 min) followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 30 s), annealing (51 °C, 30 s) and extension (72 °C, 1.5 min), and a final extension step (72 °C, 10 min). Capillary electrophoresis analysis was performed on the QIAxcel Advanced System (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. For each electrophoresis process, a QIAxcel DNA High Resolution Cartridge, an Alignment Marker 50 bp/5000 bp, a size marker 250 bp-4000 bp, and the OM 500 method were used. The electrophoresis analyses were performed using the QIAxcel Screengel Software v1.2.0 (Qiagen), and the DNA fingerprint gel images were analyzed with the GelJ v1_3 software, according to Heras et al. [30]. Dendrograms were generated using the following parameters: similarity method (Pearson’s correlation), linkage (UPGMA) and tolerance of 2%.

The analysis of 16S sequencing data was performed with the Torrent Suite Software (v4.4) and ION Reporter (v4.4). The bioinformatics workflow corresponded to Metagenomics 16S beta. The following parameters were used: Curated MicroSEQ® 16S Reference Library V2013.1 (Data Bank), size minimum of reads 150 bp, percentage of alignments for identification 90%, minimal read abundance for validation 10, cut-off Gender 97% minimal alignment, cut-off species 99% minimal alignment, slash-call was defined as 0.8%. The data was expressed as percentages of phylum and families from taxonomical consensus between the 7 hypervariable regions.

The SIMCA software has a dedicated plot, called S-plot. The S-plot is a useful and reliable tool to identify important discriminating variables. This plot combines in a scatter plot the modelled covariance [Cov (t1,X) = p1] and modelled correlation [Corr (t1,X) = p(corr)1] of each X-variable with the predictive component from the OPLS-DA model. The p1-axis will describe the magnitude of each variable, the p(corr)1- axis will represent the reliability of each variable. X-variables which combine high magnitude and high reliability are of relevance in the search for discriminating variables. The extraction of the discriminating variables from the S-plot could be combined with the jack-knifed confidence intervals seen in the loading plot [33,34].

Traditional culture-methods were applied to study gastrointestinal microbiota of rats exposed to R. First, we performed a selection protocol on fecal samples from control (n = 6) and R 5000 ppm (n = 6) treated rats using media prepared as previously described [35,36]. It allowed us to compare the results of traditional culture-methods to those of our 16S sequencing analysis. Briefly, dilutions of fecal samples (aiming to obtain 30–300 CFU per Petri dish) were incubated in selective agar medium (Table 1) in triplicate and counted (252 cultures). Then, with the objective of reproducing bacterial community and its interactions, we studied the effects of R on bacterial strains isolated from rat feces of the control group in order to see if a short-term R exposure can reproduce the effects observed after a chronic exposure in vivo. Control bacterial strains were incubated in liquid media (RCM broth) with different concentrations of R (0.1 ppb, 400 ppm and 5000 ppm) in triplicate. After 24 h of treatment, samples were diluted to appropriate factor to allow counting, cultured (24 h) in selective agar media and afterward all colonies were counted. Ultimately, we studied the dose-response relationship of R toxic effects by exposing the different strains isolated from rat feces (control group) to R for 24 h. R and Glyphosate have been adjusted with NaOH to pH = 7 to avoid acidity impacts and filtered (0.22 μm) to eliminate possible contamination. After 24 h of exposure, the absorbance (600 nm) was measured and the 50% of growth inhibition (MIC50) intervals were estimated. Inhibition rate was confirmed on agar plates with the same concentration of R. Statistical differences were determined by a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, using InfoStat® version 2012 software (InfoStat Group, Cordoba, Argentina).

One strain isolated on RCM agar plate (Biokar Diagnostics, France) had a particular phenotype when cultivated with 5000 ppm of R. A colony was pelleted and seeded with and without 5000 ppm of R in 10 mL of liquid RCM. After 72 h at 37 °C, cells were centrifuged, washed in physiological water, and concentrated to be analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). IR spectroscopy is a simple and cheap tool able to give rapid global information about the physiological status of microorganisms, as IR spectra reflect the global chemical composition of the sample [37]. It can provide information on existing taxonomic differences, or on chemical changes owing to stressful environments [38]. Registered spectra were analyzed with OPUS 6.5 (Bruker) software, on spectral windows 3100–2800 + 1500–1350 cm−1, 1800–1500 cm−1 and 1200–900 cm−1 for studying fatty acids, proteins and polysaccharides, respectively [37]. Spectra comparisons were performed by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) using vector normalization of first derivative and Ward́s algorithm. Taxonomical determination was performed by the API® 20E™ phenotypic assay (bioMérieux SA, France) and Sanger sequencing of 16S RNA gene as follows.

DNA was extracted with the Kit EZ1 DNA Tissue (Qiagen). A total of 200 μL of bacterial strain was centrifugated for 5 min at 8000 rpm. The supernatant was removed and 200 μL of G2 buffer was added. The suspension was vortexed and placed into an EZ1 2 mL microtube before extraction was done with the automatic extractor EZ1 Advanced system (Qiagen). A total of 200 μL of DNA was obtained. Amplification was made with primers 16S-Bact-8F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and 16S-Bact-1510R (5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) for 16S DNA and with primers EPSPS-P1-F (5′-CGGGATCCATGGAATCCCTGACGTTACAA-3′) and EPSPS-P2-R (5′-GCGGATCCTCAGGCTGCCTGGCTAATC-3′) for EPSPS gene [39]. The cycling conditions were as follows. A first denaturation was performed for 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles made of a denaturation step of 30 s at 95 °C, an annealing step of 30 s at 60 °C and an elongation step of 90 s at 72 °C. Amplification results were controlled by capillary electrophoresis analyses performed on the QIAxcel Advanced System (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Amplified DNAs were purified with MinElute Purification Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer protocol. Purified amplicons were sent to Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany) for Sanger sequencing.

Total DNA extracted from feces (4,033,668,501 bases) were sequenced passing 93,2% the Q20, a quality score representing the probability of incorrect base call (1 error for every 100 bases). A total of 2,305,131 reads (sequences) were obtained and 776,220 were mapped to known reference sequences. Details are showed in Table 2.

At this stage, our results highlight significant differences between treated females and all others groups of rats (control males, control females and treated males). These differences mostly consisted of an increased in the Bacteroidetes family S24-7 and a decrease Lactobacillaceae in 8 out of the 9 females treated with different doses of R. In order to control possible distortion of DNA extraction and/or amplification repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) profiles were realized, using the same batch of extraction (Fig. 4A) and 2 additional extractions (Fig. 4B and C). The three profiles are slightly discordant but they all confirm the 16S sequencing results in 8 of the 9 treated females, which clearly separate from controls (males and females) and treated males.

High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA has progressively replaced traditional culture methods in the last decade even if the latter are still interesting. In order to compare the results of both methods, we have measured total anaerobes, total aerobes, Clostridia, Bifidobacteria, Lactobacilli, Enterococci and Coliforms in feces of 3 males and 3 females treated with 5000 ppm of R and their relative control (Fig. 5). The results did not reflect the trends observed in the 16S sequencing analysis. We observed very strong method deviation, especially in Enterococci and Coliform populations making it very difficult to observe possible treatment related effects. It is thus not clear whether our protocol based on Poulsen et al., 2007 was reliable to test for alterations in microbiome composition.

Parallel investigations on other organs from the same animals have shown that the exposure to R has provoked liver and kidney damage [29,41]. It is difficult to definitively attribute the gut microbiome alterations seen in our study to a direct effect of R because other studies have shown that gut microbiome alterations can be secondary to liver damage [42]. We have thus exposed isolated gastrointestinal strains from feces of a control male rat to different concentrations of R over 24 h in order to ascertain if R can have a direct effect on bacterial growth (Fig. 6A). We observed a significant growth inhibition at the two highest concentrations (400 and 5000 ppm) of total anaerobes population, Bifidobacteria, Clostridia, and Enterococci. Lactobacilli were less sensitive; their growth was not altered at 400 ppm Coliforms were not sensitive to any of the R concentrations tested. This is confirmed by the study of the effects of increasing concentrations on isolated gastrointestinal strains (Fig. 6B). The estimated MIC50 were (in ppm) 100–500 for Enterococci, Clostridia and Bifidobacteria; 1000–5000 for Lactobacilli, and up to 10,000 for Coliforms. These results demonstrated a differential sensitivity of the main cultivable families of the rat gut microbiota including a global higher sensitivity of the anaerobe community. It suggests that gut microbiome disturbances provoked by R exposure can be due to a direct selective bactericidal action, although the MIC50 were very high in comparison to the R concentration administered in vivo.

We observed an unusual colony morphotype (Fig. 7A) on agar RCM with 5000 ppm of R after growth under aerobic conditions (72 h). Colonies were bigger than those observed under lower R concentrations or controls. This strain reversed to a normal morphotype when it was reseeded into another plate without R. This probably resulted from a metabolic adaptation rather than to a random mutation because a new seeding with R 5000 ppm led again to this unusual morphotype. We observed a high tolerance or resistance to R and even G (results not shown) after 24 and 72 h of liquid culture. An infrared spectral analysis was undertaken in order to understand these physiological adaptations. FT-IR spectra of the two morphotypes showed differences in lipids (3100–2800 cm−1 + 1500-1300 cm−1), proteins (1800–1500 cm−1) and carbohydrates (1200–900 cm−1) windows, the last being the most important (Fig. 7B). A microscopic observation after Gram coloration (Fig. 7A) showed altered bacterial cells suggesting cell wall modifications as confirmed by IR carbohydrate band modifications. Identification was performed first by testing different culture media. The strain grew on MacConkey Agar but did not grow on Slanetz and Bartley medium or in the presence of polymyxine B (inhibition of Gram −). These results suggest a coliform colony type. We then also undertook an API 20E detection system combined with 16S RNA gene sequencing analysis of these bacteria. This confirmed that the selected strain belongs to the Escherichia coli family (Supplementary Material 7). A DNA amplification of the EPSPS gene (G target) was undertaken in order to explain the particular morphotype of the E. coli selective strain. It was unsuccessful showing a possible absence of this gene and the shikimate pathway.

We present the first investigation on the long-term effects of an exposure to R on the gut microbiome composition of a laboratory rodent. The microbiome of Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to different concentrations of R for 673 days was compared to control rats of the same age raised in similar conditions. The high-throughput 16S sequencing analysis revealed that R exposure via drinking water caused sex-specific alterations of the rat gut microbiome (discussed below), reflected by an increase in the Bacteroidetes family S24-7 and a decrease in Lactobacillaceae in females. R had a direct selective bactericidal action on isolated gastrointestinal strains which could explain the effects observed in vivo.

An important consideration is that R is a mixture of G with various formulants and ingredients. These compounds can be sometimes up to 10,000 times more toxic than G in human cells in vitro [61] and have endocrine disrupting effects [62]. The toxicity of pesticides detected after some epidemiological studies has been attributed to an exposure to formulants. For instance, populations of farmers exposed to solvents or petroleum distillates have a higher risk of their children developing hypospadias [63] and more allergic and non-allergic wheeze conditions [64]. A recent study has shown that dietary emulsifiers, which are chemically similar to pesticide formulants, promoted colon cancer in a mouse model through gut microbiome alterations [65]. The toxicity of R could be either due to G or its formulants, or to a synergistic effect of all components. As mixtures are held confidential, it is difficult to attribute the toxicity to a given component, and several could be involved. Future studies involving a parallel administration of either G or R would shed light on this issue. This is in line with new methodological approaches aiming to identify the potential hazards arising from cumulative exposures to mixtures of chemicals [66,67]. Additionally, longitudinal studies will be needed to provide insight into the temporal dynamics of R toxic effects.

We have shown for the first time in vivo the long-term toxicity of R on a mammalian gut microbiome. This toxicity appears to be sex dependent since only treated females showed a dysbiosis. Microbiome disturbances substantially overlapped with those associated with liver dysfunction [43]. Molecular mechanisms of R tolerance or resistance observed in the coliform isolated strain would need to be investigated in further studies. Overall, the alteration of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio by the exposure to environmental pollutants, including by R as shown here, can have a role in the epidemic of intestinal disorders. The traditional vision implying that only compounds that are systemically absorbed have a toxicological relevance is outdated in regard of the latest discoveries attributing major physiological roles of the gut microbiome. The study of gut microbiome composition in long-term toxicity studies performed prior to chemical market authorization would be an important step to protect human populations from the toxicity of gut microbiome disruptors.
