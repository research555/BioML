Gut microbes, ageing & organ function: a chameleon in modern biology?

All species, including humans, are cohabited by a myriad of microbial species, which massively influences body function in a diet‐, exercise‐ and age‐dependent manner. The microbiome composition differs between individuals, partly due to the polymorphic immune system, as well as the environment, making the microbe–host interplay unique in each one of us. Ageing is a gradual loss of function in part due to reduced repair mechanisms and accumulation of tissue damage through mechanisms largely unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that our indigenous microbes, a known major regulator of human physiology, are also connected to regulate the ageing process through signalling pathways and metabolites though the biological mechanisms are unknown. At an ageing meeting in Singapore in 2018, investigators discussed the current understanding of microbe regulation and its impact on healthy ageing. This review summarizes the highlights from the meeting and conveys some of the new ideas that emerged around gut microbes and the biology of ageing. While highly speculative, an idea emerged in which gut microbes constantly respond and evolve to environmental cues, as part of an ageing process, thus serving as a second messenger to support and attenuate organ decline in a diet‐, gender‐ and age‐dependent manner.

Throughout evolution, complex organisms have acquired prokaryotic organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts to optimize biological functions (Gilbert et al, 2012; Douglas, 2014). Human beings coexist in a complex symbiotic relationship with more than a 1,000 different bacterial species in and on our bodies (Qin et al, 2010). These indigenous microbes occupy multiple niches in a temporal and spatial fashion through mechanisms that are largely unknown. The predominant location of microbes is in the alimentary tract (Kundu et al, 2017), where they execute numerous functions including securing nutritional supply through highly sophisticated metabolic circuits.

Current models suggest that microbes massively influence host physiology (Brown et al, 2013; Hooper et al, 2001, 2002; Nicholson et al, 2012, Natarajan & Pluznick, 2014). The intensity and dynamics of these interactions between the host and the microbes are highly variable due to large differences in microbiome composition and diversity. Therefore, each individual is a unique composite of eukaryotic genes and microbes that collectively impact body function and well‐being in a diet‐, sex‐ and age‐dependent manner (Leser & Mølbak, 2009; Spor et al, 2011). That is, the mechanisms by which microbiome composition, richness, and metabolites tune organ maturation, formation of body homeostasis, and function in a human being in early life are likely to also be good predictors for microbiome‐associated regulation of both healthy ageing and diseases such as type II diabetes, cardiovascular perturbations, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.

The newborn mammalian offspring acquires colonizing microbes predominantly from the birth canal during vaginal delivery from the mother, thereby providing a trajectory of early maternal colonizers dominated by Lactobacillus, Bifidobacter and Prevotella spp (Dominguez‐Bello et al, 2010). This biologically selected pathway of child delivery is currently under threat due to the rapidly increasing number of children delivered by Caesarean section. Recent data suggest an early microbiome composition different to those undergoing vaginal delivery, thereby changing the evolutionary selected symbiotic vertical transmission of maternal microbes (Dunn et al, 2017).

In addition, highly controversial reports suggest that exposure to microbes may occur before birth in the womb (Bearfield et al, 2002; Markenson et al, 2003; Jiménez et al, 2005; Rautava et al, 2012; Hou et al, 2013; Stout et al, 2013; Aagaard et al, 2014; Mändar et al, 2015; Zheng et al, 2015; Verstraelen et al, 2016), thus challenging the sterile womb dogma (Stout et al, 2013). While fascinating, it remains to be excluded that the presence of these microbes may be experimental contamination processes. Less controversial are the reports showing that maternal microbes are also transmitted to newborns via breast milk (Heikkilä & Saris, 2003; Martín et al, 2003; Beasley & Saris, 2004), which provide them with approximately 8 × 104 to 8 × 106 bacteria daily (Heikkilä & Saris, 2003). That is, breastfeeding is a powerful way of enhancing the colonization process and increasing the microbial diversity and thus the maturation of the gut microbiome (higher levels of Bifidobacterium species, characterized by Firmicutes bacteria) (Stewart et al, 2018). As the growing child develops, the microbiome undergoes a continuum of changes in diversity and species. A longitudinal study was performed on stool samples from 903 children aged between 3 and 46 months as part of the Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic sequencing revealed that the gut microbiome progresses in what the investigators characterize as a step‐dependent manner; an early developmental phase lasting up to 14 months of age, an expanding transitional phase up to 30 months of age followed by the entry into a stable phase up to 46 months (Stewart et al, 2018). These changes in early life coincide with the gradual exposure to different diets including solid food, which significantly impact and further diversify microbiome composition and diversity by a rapid expansion of anaerobes.

The young human gradually acquires the adult microbiome, resulting in what is commonly known as the mature microbiome (Borre et al, 2014). A trademark of the adult microbiome is its stability, which possesses the ability to mitigate transient effects of stress, a potential disruptor of microbial stability (Borre et al, 2014). Despite its stability, the gut microbes possess the ability to respond to environmental cues. Hence, this opens the door to therapeutic interventions specifically targeting the microbial community at the individual level. For example, differences in environmental factors (Kundu et al, 2017; Stewart et al, 2018) have been shown to influence microbiome composition and diversity.

Profiling of biofluids can help elucidate the function of the microbiome. Recently, an attractive diet for healthy ageing from the OmniHeart trial was shown to reduce blood pressure and triglycerides (Appel et al, 2005; Miller et al, 2006; Doménech et al, 2014). This diet contains several essential metabolites: guanidinoacetate and phenylacetylglutamine p‐cresol sulphate. The OmniHeart trial tested three different diets, all with the same calorific value. One diet was enriched in carbohydrates, the other in protein, and the third diet in unsaturated fat. The protein‐rich and unsaturated fat‐rich diets showed reduced blood pressure and blood lipids with a reduction in the risk of heart disease over a next 10‐year period (Appel et al, 2005; Miller et al, 2006; Doménech et al, 2014). While this diet is targeted specifically for the maintenance of a healthy heart, it also has significant beneficial effects on brain health and hence overall body health. Using the MIND diet, a hybrid of the Mediterranean and DASH diet suggests that it is possible to decrease the incidence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (Tangney, 2014; Morris et al, 2015a,b). While further studies are highly warranted, it seems our grandparents’ wisdom can add value to modern day science, when they would tell us the benefits of eating a wide variety of food and consuming an inclusive diet. In fact, food intake that has limited diversity of animal and plant products (i.e. white flour and white sugar) severely restricts gut microbiome diversity (Heiman & Greenway, 2016). That is, exposing the body to either a plant‐ or animal‐based diet even temporally drastically changes the structure of the gut microbiome (David et al, 2014).

There is a rapid expansion of an ageing population worldwide. For example, 14% of the Australian population is over 65 and it is predicted to rise to 22% by 2061 (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2013) and 28% of the population in Singapore will be aged 65 or older by 2030 (Siau, 2017). Hence, more resources should be allocated to address the role of gut microbes in regulating the biology of ageing in addition to other mechanistic studies revolving on the physiology and pathophysiology of ageing. Current data suggest that considerable changes in microbiome composition and diversity occur early in life when the expanding microbiome is to be formed and build the growing offspring (Kundu et al, 2017). Similarly, later in life, when body function declines, due to gradual loss of function and accumulation of organ damage, reduced number of stem cells and reduced ability to repair the ageing body, the microbiome appears to reduce in diversity and richness (O'Toole & Claesson, 2010). Interestingly, the reduction of diversity and richness are associated with the degree of social interactions with other humans. Reduced interactions with other people result in reduced microbial diversity, thus implying social interactions as another way to support microbiome richness and diversity (O'Toole & Claesson, 2010). Because reduced diversity has been associated with increased susceptibility to disease acquisition, further experiments are highly warranted especially in the light of the rapidly growing population of elderly often associated with increased isolation and detachment from society (Cho & Blaser, 2012).

Assessing case studies of Parkinson's disease (Parkinson's, UK, 2018) and cancer (Cancer Research UK) in the UK, these diseases are strongly associated with age (Chu & Kordower, 2007), with a significant rise in the incidence of Parkinson's disease and cancer from the 60–64 age bracket until 75–79 years of age. These focused studies elucidate correlation between ageing and disease. In addition, the remaining surviving population of individuals over the age of 80 may have entirely bypassed the age‐related chronic diseases, either due to genetic reasons, the environment they have lived in or even a change in their bodies to support extreme ageing. The extremely old population, including centenarians who live beyond 100 years of age, has an even more distinct and unique microbial footprint as compared to the elderly (Biagi et al, 2010, 2016). The centenarians are populated with Akkermansia, Christensenellaceae and Bifidobacterium (Biagi et al, 2016). This variation is even greater than the difference in microbiome population observed between young adults and the elderly with an age gap of approximately 40 years (Biagi et al, 2016). While no direct causality has been shown, this raises the possibility of the existence of pro‐ageing microbiome that could facilitate a healthier population, which could go on to live a much longer life, allowing extreme ageing.

Ageing has been described as an age‐dependent increase in failure rates of the organs in the human body. In most cases, this is due to a gradual loss of function in response to reduced ability to repair and support tissues with oxygen and nutrients. Importantly, the human body is a closed system and all organs are connected to one another. Perturbation in one organ often impacts other organs via inter‐organ crosstalk. Failure of the system occurs when there is a deviation of the homeostatic body function from the expected optimal function (Deshpande et al, 1986; Gavrilov & Gavrilova, 2001; Lai & Xie, 2006). It can thus be proposed that it is the body system's redundancy for the irreplaceable elements (the organs that work together) that is responsible for ageing (Deshpande et al, 1986; Gavrilov & Gavrilova, 2001; Lai & Xie, 2006). While ageing occurs in all organs, promising examples of holistic interventions (calorie restriction, drugs such as rapamycin, lifestyle alteration and supplements) have shown that ageing can be slowed down. Furthermore, the introduction of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell transplantation and whole‐organ transplantation implies that we can expect changes in the average lifetime of a human being.

Hence, further studies are warranted to unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms as well as to obtain a detailed metabolome map to superimpose the changes in microbiome composition and disease phenotype. Profiling the metabolome in conditions of neurodegenerative diseases via different mass spectrometry techniques, to identify endogenous molecules as well as dietary metabolites, unlocks a better understanding for dietary interventions that modify the microbiome to enhance health and cognitive function.

Nearly 30 years ago, longevity genes were identified in non‐vertebrate organisms following attempts to identify genes that are associated with ageing. Although humans are at the top of the food chain and possess the highest cognitive ability, studying other organisms can provide us with deeper insights into pathways controlling ageing. The hydra, for example, propagates asexually as their stem cells do not fail to renew or regenerate and hence are non‐senescent (Schaible et al, 2011; Schaible & Sussman, 2013). In the search for longevity genes, the roles of APOE and FOXO3A were examined. FOXO was then identified as a key regulator of epithelial homeostasis and host–microbiome crosstalk. FOXO3A is a signature protein related to ageing and its downregulation results in slow down of population growth rate. Hence, it is known as a rate‐of‐ageing regulator (Schaible & Sussman, 2013).

Little is known about the mechanisms and signalling pathways underlying gut–brain communication. The major hurdle is the complexity in which microbes can communicate with the brain, and moreover, the myriad of output signals from CNS that modulate and change the gut microbiome also referred to as “the evolving inner self”. (Kundu et al, 2017). There are a number of recent association studies where a dysbiotic microbiome combined with changes in diet appear to impact conditions like neurodegenerative diseases and chronic inflammation in the bowel, including irritable bowel syndrome. While encouraging, these data are largely obtained from transgenic animal models. There is an imminent need to obtain data from epidemiological and prospective studies including both healthy old people as well as those with defined diseases (Collado et al, 2016).

While global initiatives and research focus on developing solutions for famine, diarrhoea and malnourishment, we have acquired an entire new set of chronic diseases that occur later in life, which has become one of the greatest challenges for human health. There is a rapid and explosive change in chronic disease spectrum (Rivera et al, 2002; Who & Consultation, 2003), which cannot be explained by genetics alone. Rather, environmental interactions including introduction of antibiotics, reduced exercise and reduced cost for unhealthy food are likely factors. No doubt, these changes have also massively altered our microbiome. There is therefore an intense global research effort to identify the biomarkers of ageing, predict age‐related diseases and intervene at an early stage (Zglinicki & Martin‐Ruiz, 2005; DelaRosa et al, 2006; Simm et al, 2008; Martin‐Ruiz et al, 2011). While successful interventions, be it drugs, change of diet or lifestyle, can postpone or attenuate the onset of ageing‐related diseases, most efforts are still focusing on these conditions in isolation, thereby missing the holistic approach to maintaining body function among the elderly. The transformation of human working conditions brought about by the industrial revolution drastically exposed the limitations of an ageing body with evident functional deficiencies and loss of productivity of the elderly in our communities (Lee, 2007). This transition in part destroyed the ancient view of elderly as the golden generation filled with wisdom and hence, an important asset to society.

Moving forward to better understand biological ageing and to reduce disease burden, a comprehensive perspective must be applied. In addition, improved quality of life is intimately coupled to breaking the pattern of disease occurring due to age, minimizing the years of morbidity in each elderly individual and introducing effective interventions that can reduce disability and dependency (Lunenfeld & Stratton, 2013). Successful ageing focuses on absence of disease, enabling good physical and cognitive function and active levels of social engagement (Bowling & Dieppe, 2005). Interestingly, a recent report added to this phenomenon of successful ageing by discussing the age‐related association between disease susceptibility and diversity of the microbiome (Cho & Blaser, 2012).

Ageing is about understanding the accumulation of changes over the years, including social, physical and psychological changes. While function and dynamics of organs slow down in the ageing body, concomitant with increased reaction time, age allows for the expansion of human wisdom and knowledge of the world. Likewise, the microbiome undergoes changes in composition and richness presumed to be compensatory to the reduced physiological dynamics in the heart, lung, and locomotion. However, wisdom combined with a microbiome adaptation to age as such does not remove the fact that the greatest risk to humans as it leads to an increasing risk of disease acquisition.

Over the past decades, families no longer choose to live in large, extended families, but rather opt for the nuclear family system resulting in the “family decline” hypothesis (Bengtson, 2001). When coupled with the rise of social media, this widens the communication barrier between the elderly and the rest of the family (as well as the microbial exposure). The lack or inability of elders to communicate among the family, i.e. use their social calls or pass down their wisdom, could also be a factor to look into when designing holistic solutions to enable active ageing or delay wasting in the elderly populations.

The ancient philosophers addressed ageing from a societal and holistic perspective. While extensively discussing youth and old age, they reached a consensus that ageing is a matter of perception with no clear boundaries. Plato, for instance, addressed the concept of ageing from two stances, continuity and disengagement, where he defined continuity as the ability of the elderly to persist with the previous activities during their youth and referred to disengagement when people drifted away from previous goals, strategies and aims in life [105]. Applying Plato's wisdom to 21st century precision medicine and the concepts of physiological ageing, healthy ageing can only be achieved if we maintain consistency of robust living as we did in our youth. Negligence of our health and wellness over the years results in the gradual slowing down and hence, disengagement, spiralling towards conditions predicted by Aristotle; illnesses and pain as companions of old age (Gendlin & Gendlin, 2012).

In the post‐Pasteur microbial century of “good microbe” centred perception, it follows that if we continue to support our microbes with the temporal and spatial cues (diet, exercise, community exposure and decreased stress) they require to maintain diversity and thus homeostasis, it will undoubtedly have positive repercussions on body function. This echoes the sentiments of Plutarch, who advocated that we have the power to build up physical and mental qualifications, which we are then able to exploit in our old age (Trench, 1874). If we live an active and healthy life during our youth, our old age will be more productive and manageable, similar to the viewpoint of Galen.

The average lifespan in Classical Greece was reported to be 25 years but increased to 42 years after they crossed adulthood due to high infant mortality (Angel, 1947), and it eventually reached 72 years during the Roman period (Montagu, 1994). Current statistics show that human beings are living longer in the industrial world (Cervellati & Sunde, 2005) thus reflecting the fact we as a species have accumulated experience and know‐how for a longer lifespan. Clearly, we are at the beginning of unravelling mechanisms underlying ageing and it will take a long time to transition from a reductionist mindset to understanding ageing with a holistic perception. Yet, the recent re‐discovery of the indigenous microbes as a central player in human health and disease provides optimism. If we assess the human body function from a systems biology understanding of the ageing process, which ancient philosophers have empowered us with, then ageing will be as positive or negative as we believe. Using the gut microbiome as a target for future interventions with diet, microbial metabolites and possibly certain probiotics suggests that we may have a better control over how we choose to live our golden years, either in bliss or in pain. As Goethe wrote in his letter to Humboldt in 1732, 5 days before his death, “The ancients used to say: Animals are instructed by their organs. I will add: Men are too, but they have the advantage of being able to instruct their organs in their turn”. Perhaps our indigenous gut microbes are part of the second messenger instruction to our organs.
