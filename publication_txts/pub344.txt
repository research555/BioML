Targeting the Gut Microbiome as a Treatment for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis: A Conceptional Framework

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare, immune-mediated, chronic cholestatic liver disease associated with a unique phenotype of inflammatory bowel disease that frequently manifests as pancolitis with right-sided predominance. Available data suggest a bidirectional interplay of the gut-liver axis with critical roles for the gastrointestinal microbiome and circulating bile acids (BAs) in the pathophysiology of PSC. BAs shape the gut microbiome, whereas gut microbes have the potential to alter BAs, and there are emerging data that alterations of BAs and the microbiome are not simply a consequence but the cause of PSC. Clustering of PSC in families may suggest that PSC occurs in genetically susceptible individuals. After exposure to an environmental trigger (e.g., microbial byproducts or BAs), an aberrant or exaggerated cholangiocyte-induced immune cascade occurs, ultimately leading to bile duct damage and progressive fibrosis. The pathophysiology can be conceptualized as a triad of (1) gut dysbiosis, (2) altered BA metabolism, and (3) immune-mediated biliary injury. Immune activation seems to be central to the disease process, but immunosuppression does not improve clinical outcomes or alter the natural history of PSC. Currently, orthoptic liver transplantation is the only established life-saving treatment, whereas antimicrobial therapy or fecal transplantation is an emerging therapeutic option for PSC. The beneficial effects of these microbiome-based therapies are likely mediated by a shift of the gut microbiome with favorable effects on BA metabolism. In the future, personalized approaches will allow to better target the interdependence between microbiome, immune function, and BA metabolism and potentially cure patients with PSC.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an uncommon chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts, leading to the formation of multifocal bile duct strictures and progressive fibrotic transformation of bile ducts (1). Hepatic fibrosis is promoted by these biliary changes, ultimately leading to cirrhosis and liver failure (2). There is a strong association between PSC and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly ulcerative colitis (UC). Between 2.5% and 7.5% of individuals with IBD will eventually develop PSC. Conversely, between 60% and 70% of patients with PSC have IBD (3). Furthermore, the phenotype of IBD occurring in PSC is unique and differs from the typical phenotype seen in patients with UC or Crohn's disease (CD) (4). Patients with PSC-IBD typically have mild intestinal disease activity and an increased incidence of extensive colitis typically pancolitis, with a right-sided predominance, rectal sparing, and backwash ileitis.

In the clinical setting, a diagnosis of PSC (1) is made in patients with a cholestatic biochemical profile when cholangiography (e.g., magnetic resonance cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiography) shows characteristic bile duct changes with multifocal strictures and segmental dilatations, and secondary causes of sclerosing cholangitis have been excluded (5).

PSC occurs more commonly in men than in women (2:1). The mean age at the time of diagnosis is approximately 40 years (6). Using a random-effects model, a systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that the pooled incidence rate for PSC was 0.77 (0.45–1.09) per 100,000 person-years (7).

PSC is often progressive, leading to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease. In the absence of any pharmacological therapy, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) represents the only curative option (8,9). The median life expectancy after a diagnosis of PSC is 13.2–21.3 years without liver transplantation (6). There is a 3-fold mortality rate increase (hazard ratio 2.92, 95% CI 2.16–3.94) and a 2-fold increase in risk of any malignancy (hazard ratio 2.23, 95% CI 0.88–6.11) in patients with PSC compared with the general population; (10). However, cancer-related death far exceeds death caused by end-stage liver disease and other nonmalignant complications of the disease (11).

The pathophysiology of PSC is multifactorial, with genetic and environmental factors implicated.

It is now believed that PSC occurs in genetically susceptible individuals (12) after exposure to an environmental trigger (13). This exposure initiates a series of events involving complex interactions between the innate and adaptive immune systems, ultimately leading to gut-derived activated lymphocytes migrate to the liver, cholangiocyte damage, and progressive fibrosis (8). The obvious association between PSC and IBD points toward a possible role of autoimmunity (2). Indeed, characteristic human leukocyte antigen haplotype associations have been recognized in PSC (2), and large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified genotypic associations in cohorts with PSC (14,15). More than 70% of patients with PSC also have IBD, and at least 2 common gene loci have been identified in genome-wide association studies for PSC and UC (14). Overall, the most plausible explanation for the pathogenesis of PSC is immunogenic priming in a genetically predisposed individual, leading to the characteristic phenotype, that is likely further influenced by other host or environmental factor (8).

Several important observations, coupled with the strong association between certain human leukocyte antigen haplotypes and frequency of concurrent extrahepatic autoimmune disorders, support the concept that PSC is an immune-mediated phenomenon. The possible role of liver-gut crosstalk in PSC and UC pathogenesis may be related to the enterohepatic circulation of lymphocytes (16) referred to as the gut lymphocyte homing hypothesis. This theory postulates that a subset activated T cells from the gut appear home in on the liver, then initiate and inflict damage (17).

As more than 60% of patients with PSC have coexistent IBD, the pathogenesis of PSC seems to be related to the manifestation of the inflammatory changes of the bowel that seem to mirror UC. It is now widely accepted that the microbiome plays a key role for the manifestation and progression of IBD (18). Similarly, there is now accumulating evidence that alterations of the gastrointestinal microbiome are central to the pathogenesis of PSC (19). Several clinical trials (Table
1) provide evidence that the stool microbiome and the microbiome adherent to the colonic mucosa are distinct in patients with PSC compared with patients with IBD without PSC and non-IBD controls.

The thus far largest study on the microbiome (20) included 137 patients with PSC and found differences in the microbiota profiles between patients with PSC and UC. Despite the observed dysbiosis, it was not possible to differentiate PSC and UC based on microbial taxonomic characteristics. The taxonomic differences between patients with PSC and UC may have pathophysiological significances (21). Microbes can contribute—either in isolation or collectively via specific metabolic products and/or interference with the mucosal immune system—toward the pathophysiology of PSC (or IBD). Several studies (20,22–27) have shown that patients with PSC have an overrepresentation of Veillonella spp. This taxon (and others enriched in patients with PSC-IBD) can produce amine oxidases. Amine oxidase such as vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) facilitates adhesion of gut-tropic lymphocytes to the liver endothelium (28) and potentially contributes to the manifestation of PSC-IBD via aberrant lymphocyte tracking between the bowel and liver (29). The alteration in the relative abundance of Veillonella in the gut microbiome is not specific for PSC and is potentially a marker of advanced liver disease (30,31). In addition, Vieria-Silva et al. (32) have very observed that an increase in Enterococcus spp. is positively associated with serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and bile duct obstruction. They also reported that increases in Veillonella and Fusobacterium spp. are both capable of driving the proinflammatory burden associated with PSC and PSC-IBD but are coexclusive, with members of the latter genus favored in patients with CD or PSC-CD. Lemoinne et al. (25), reported fungal dysbiosis in patients with PSC. They found a decrease in the proportion of the Saccharomycetaceae family, including the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, known to have anti-inflammatory properties and shown to be decreased in patients with active IBD (33). All these findings suggest that the gut microbiome might be involved in the pathogenesis of PSC (and associated IBD) while patients with PSC and IBD have a microbiome that is distinct from patients with IBD alone. Thus far, no specific microbial signature unique to PSC has been identified based on relative abundances alone, and more studies with comprehensive functional and quantitative characterization of the microbiome are warranted.

The human gut microbiota consists of thousands of different bacterial species and other microorganisms with defined functions. This microbial ecosystem maintains homeostasis through a tight balance between the mucosal immune system, cell-to-cell signaling, and subsequent release of antimicrobial peptides to control neighboring bacterial clades (34). Commensal microbial metabolism produces essential vitamins and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and modifies a variety of endogenous and exogenous sources of complex molecules (e.g., BAs and xenobiotics) that can contribute to the gut metabolome (35,36). The SCFAs, particularly butyrate, regulate innate and adaptive immune cell generation, trafficking, and function and have anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, SCFAs play an active role in modulating the mucosal immune system to establish a tolerant phenotype against beneficial commensal microbiota (37). However, the biodiversity of gut microbes implicated in coordinating BA metabolism and their conversion(s) from primary to secondary BAs is narrow and perhaps better defined from a genetic and biochemical context than other aspects of microbial metabolism in the human gut (38).

There is emerging evidence that luminal bile acids affect the gastrointestinal microbiome. BAs have antimicrobial activity by damaging the bacterial cell membrane and thus inhibiting bacteria outgrowth (45). Reduced BA concentrations are associated with bacterial overgrowth (46,47). Indeed, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis (48) suggested that advanced chronic liver disease is associated with bacterial overgrowth. Gut bacteria metabolize BAs and thus influence BA composition and BA hydrophobicity (49). These BAs also shape the gut microbiota communities, whereas intestinal microbes alter BAs. Thus, there is a bidirectional interaction between the intestinal microbiota and BAs (50). Thus, there is a link between gastrointestinal microbes and hepatic BA metabolisms. This gut-to-liver axis may play a critical role in the regulation of enterohepatic circulation of BAs, BA pool size, and BA composition. Alterations of the BA homeostasis and excessive intrahepatic accumulation of (potentially toxic) BAs and/or their metabolites are thought to play a pivotal role in mediating the hepatic injury of cholestatic diseases (51).

The regulatory functions of BAs are mainly the result of activation of intracellular ligand-activated nuclear receptors, such as the farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) and cell surface G protein–coupled receptors, specifically the G protein–coupled BA receptor (TGR5 or GPBAR1) (52). Both receptors are highly represented in cells of innate immunity such as intestinal and liver macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer T cells. Thus, both FXR and TGR5 are critical regulators of BA metabolism, BA circulation, and intestinal immune function and contribute to the maintenance of a tolerogenic phenotype in enterohepatic tissues (52).

Bile acids also directly shape mucosal immune function via interactions with both dedicated BA receptors (FXR and GPBAR1) and nonspecific BA sensors (pregnane X receptor, vitamin D receptor, and constitutive androstane receptor). In the context of innate immunity (53–55), BAs suppress NF-κB–dependent signaling pathways (56) and inhibit NLRP3-dependent inflammasome activities (55). A recent study by Hang et al. (57) showed that BAs directly regulate the adaptive immune cells via proinflammatory Th17 cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs). A successful host immune response is generally the result of both pro- and anti-inflammatory elements that are carefully tuned with the goal of clearing the pathogen while limiting host damage (autoimmunity) (58). Thus, gut microbes can modify BAs, which in turn regulate the gut immunity and inflammation. Furthermore, the impact of mucosal immune function on BA metabolism is currently unknown and will be an area of future investigation. The 3-dimensional interplay between BAs, the microbiota, and the mucosal immune system, proposed by Chen et al. (59), likely plays a crucial role in regulating the mucosal immune homeostasis.

Although alterations of gut barrier function might be related to the mucosa-associated microbiome in the small intestine (60,61), there is also evidence that in patients with PSC, gut barrier dysfunction is associated with a poor outcome (62). Bacterial translocation and/or absorption of bacterial endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, and bacterial DNA/RNA fragments into the portal circulation via a chronically inflamed leaky bowel, combined with Kupffer cell activation, may be crucial in eliciting the proinflammatory, profibrotic hepatobiliary responses that lead to the development of PSC (5,63).

The host-microbe interactions may play a pivotal role for the so-called leaky gut and PSC microbiota hypotheses. Indeed, in an animal model of PSC, the epithelial-damaging effect of Klebsiella  pneumoniae isolated from patients with PSC was linked to bacterial translocation and increased susceptibility to TH17-mediated injuries of bile ducts (64). These findings are well aligned with the concept that microbes or microbial products may lead to an aberrant or exaggerated immune response of the cholangiocyte (increased induction of cholangiocyte senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype), which plays a central role in the pathogenesis of PSC (5). This is further supported by the thought that the epithelial cells lining the bile ducts are not only a target of injury in PSC but also actively involved drivers in the course of disease (65,66).

This suggests an interrelationship between gastrointestinal microbes, BAs, and immune-mediated damage to the epithelial lining of the bile ducts, results in an ongoing inflammatory process that defines the pathophysiology of PSC (Figure
1).

A recent Clinical Guideline of the American College of Gastroenterology (67) concludes that there is “...no approved or proven therapy…” for PSC. On the other hand, there is some evidence that antibiotic therapy is beneficial in patients with PSC. Since an initial case series of a patient with PSC was published in 1958 (68), a number of treatments including immune suppression have been tested, but none have proven to alter the course of disease or cure this disease. Indeed, until now, PSC has a poor prognosis, and OLT is so far the only proven therapy to extend life expectancy.

Against the background of the American College of Gastroenterology clinical guideline, there is emerging evidence, albeit from relatively small open-label studies that in patients with PSC, targeted modulation of the gastrointestinal microbiome may alter the course of disease to delay or even stop disease progression. The first study on the potential effect of antibiotics in PSC was published in 1959 by Rankin et al. (69). Subsequent case series and studies in adults (70–74) testing various antimicrobial agents in the treatment of PSC demonstrated improvement in ALP and the Mayo PSC Risk Score as accepted markers for the progression of PSC (75,76). In a recent cohort study (77), 17 children were treated with oral vancomycin for UC related to PSC or autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis. In 15 of 17 patients, oral vancomycin therapy achieved mucosal healing (Mayo endoscopic score 0), with 9 achieving histological remission. LFTs improved transiently or normalized in at least 12 patients.

Overall, alterations of the gastrointestinal microbiome by antibiotic therapy seem to alter the natural course of PSC and delay the progression of disease. It might even be speculated that favorable permanent changes of the gastrointestinal microbiome could potentially cure PSC.

PSC is frequently accompanied by IBD. However, the clinical features of IBD in patients with PSC are unique and distinct from typical patients with IBD (Table
2).

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) refers to the transfer of intestinal microbes from a healthy donor into a recipient with the intent of modifying the recipient's intestinal microbiome. The pilot study (88) of 10 patients with PSC with concomitant IBD in remission who underwent FMT (from a single donor) showed ≥50% reduction in ALP levels in 30% of the treated patients with PSC. This study suggests that FMT treatment is safe and results in an increased stool microbial diversity that persisted after FMT. Engrafting OTUs included genera capable of producing short-chain fatty acids, which are known to be depleted in IBD. Larger controlled studies are needed to define efficacy and define the mechanisms of FMT in PSC. Figure
2 summarizes microbiome-based therapy, targeting key pathophysiologic mechanisms central to PSC. Although FMT increases the overall stool microbial diversity, oral vancomycin therapy is associated with reduced fecal microbial diversity. Thus far, more data point toward improved clinical outcomes in response to antibiotic therapy with vancomycin; both interventions might be effective, and the precise mechanisms of these microbiome-based therapies remain to be explored.

Antimicrobial treatments targeting the gastrointestinal microbiome seem to result in significant improvement in the clinical and cholestatic biomarkers (78) and—based on case reports (87,89–91)—even long-term outcomes in PSC. FMT in PSC seems to be safe and is likely associated with a sustained improvement in the overall microbial diversity and liver enzymes. This points toward the gastrointestinal microbiome as an important disease modifier for PSC. So far, most microbiome research in PSC has focused on the stool microbiome, whereas some studies assessed the colonic mucosa–associated microbiome (Table
1). The bidirectional gut-liver axis makes it equally possible that the mucosa-associated microbiome in the small intestine harbors the microbes that are critical for the pathophysiologic process that causes PSC and the associated IBD. So far, there is cumulating evidence that the stool microbiome and the intestinal microbiome are different in patients with PSC compared with controls (Table
1), and this may explain the altered metabolic functions (e.g., in relation to metabolism of BAs) or immune function that are related to the pathophysiology of PSC.

There is a need for further in‐depth studies using system biology approaches in combination with longitudinal multilevel analyses in patients with PSC (including appropriate controls with and without other cholestatic liver diseases) to elucidate potential targets for interventions. This ultimately will result in a better understanding of the unique clinical pattern of PSC and the factors that drive manifestation and disease progression of patients with PSC with and without concomitant IBD.
