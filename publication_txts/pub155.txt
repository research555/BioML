The gut microbiome’s role in the development, maintenance, and outcomes of sepsis

The gut microbiome regulates a number of homeostatic mechanisms in the healthy host including immune function and gut barrier protection. Loss of normal gut microbial structure and function has been associated with diseases as diverse as Clostridioides difficile infection, asthma, and epilepsy. Recent evidence has also demonstrated a link between the gut microbiome and sepsis. In this review, we focus on three key areas of the interaction between the gut microbiome and sepsis. First, prior to sepsis onset, gut microbiome alteration increases sepsis susceptibility through several mechanisms, including (a) allowing for expansion of pathogenic intestinal bacteria, (b) priming the immune system for a robust pro-inflammatory response, and (c) decreasing production of beneficial microbial products such as short-chain fatty acids. Second, once sepsis is established, gut microbiome disruption worsens and increases susceptibility to end-organ dysfunction. Third, there is limited evidence that microbiome-based therapeutics, including probiotics and selective digestive decontamination, may decrease sepsis risk and improve sepsis outcomes in select patient populations, but concerns about safety have limited uptake. Case reports of a different microbiome-based therapy, fecal microbiota transplantation, have shown correlation with gut microbial structure restoration and decreased inflammatory response, but these results require further validation. While much of the evidence linking the gut microbiome and sepsis has been established in pre-clinical studies, clinical evidence is lacking in many areas. To address this, we outline a potential research agenda for further investigating the interaction between the gut microbiome and sepsis.

Sepsis, a dysregulated immune response to infection resulting in end-organ damage and potentially death, is a major public health threat [1]. Sepsis affects 1.7 million patients in the USA annually with mortality of up to 50% [2, 3]. Despite high incidence, morbidity, and mortality, there are few established treatments for sepsis. The mainstays of therapy—antibiotics and supportive care—have not changed significantly for decades.

The gut microbiome modulates several responses to sepsis and is a potential therapeutic target in sepsis [4]. Loss of normal gut microbiome structure and function has been implicated in several diseases including Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), inflammatory bowel disease, and obesity [5]. While the pathogenesis of sepsis is multifactorial and incompletely understood, there is increasing evidence that gut microbiome disruption predisposes to sepsis and negatively impact sepsis outcomes [6]. In this review, we highlight this evidence, review the use of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in sepsis, and outline research priorities for clarifying the role of the gut microbiome in sepsis. Although research into associations between the gut microbiome and sepsis has been increasing, differences in methods and outcome measures make comparisons across studies difficult. Table 1 provides an overview of important terminology for interpreting microbiome research and key terms used in this review.

Although thought to be sterile in utero, the neonatal intestine is colonized at birth. Over the first several weeks of life, acquisition of phylogenetic diversity, especially with obligate anaerobes, protects from pathogen colonization [7, 8]. A 2019 prospective cohort study of over 200 preterm infants found that increased bacterial diversity and anaerobic bacterial colonization of the neonatal gut microbiome protects against sepsis [9]. Importantly, bacterial species that predominate in the absence of anaerobes, including Staphylococcus species and Escherichia coli, are those that translocate and cause bacteremia [7, 9, 10].

Whether gut microbiome disruption prior to sepsis onset worsens sepsis outcomes in humans remains unknown. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined the impact of pre-treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics on outcomes in healthy young men given intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [26]. Although subjects randomized to broad-spectrum antibiotics had decreased α-diversity and lower abundance of several beneficial gut bacteria, there was no effect on surrogate markers of sepsis severity including vital signs and fibrinolysis [26]. As this study shows, gut microbiome composition and diversity are unlikely to account for all of the clinical heterogeneity seen in sepsis. The gut microbiome is likely one of many factors that regulate systemic sepsis response; more research is needed to clarify interactions between regulatory mechanisms.

In the presence of protective commensal bacteria, bacteria with pathogenic potential that reside in the intestinal lumen of healthy hosts (“pathobionts”) may not be able to proliferate and cause disease [27]. Loss of protective bacterial taxa allows for pathobiont proliferation [28, 29]. In a key early study, when mice were exposed to colonic inflammation and antibiotics, the gut microbiome was characterized by expansion of a pathogenic clone of multi-drug resistant (MDR) E. coli, which disseminated systemically [30].

In a separate experiment, mice were fed a high- or normal-fat diet, given broad-spectrum antibiotics, and then subjected to partial hepatectomy. The high-fat diet mice had decreased gut microbiome α-diversity, were less able to survive partial hepatectomy, and had expansion of MDR gram-negative bacteria compared to mice fed a normal diet [31]. High-fat diet mice had higher mortality and more bacterial dissemination from the gut, demonstrating that decreased gut microbiome diversity can predispose to intestinal translocation even if the primary injury is remote.

The microbiome’s influence on immune development begins with colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract at birth [7, 32]. Germ-free neonatal mice have decreased development of bone marrow myeloid precursors and resultant decreased myeloid lineage cells in the spleen, rendering them susceptible to E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus sepsis [33, 34]. Intestinal re-colonization can reduce immunologic dysfunction that predisposes to increased sepsis susceptibility [34].

While important, ex vivo studies do not fully replicate conditions present during sepsis in humans. Outside of a few small studies, there is little human data on the gut microbiome’s impact on immune modulation in sepsis [26, 43–46]. One study did not find a relationship between the gut microbiome and immune response in experimentally induced sepsis [26], whereas other studies in clinical sepsis have shown a link between gut microbiome alterations characterized by an increase in pathobionts and an exuberant immune response [43–45]. Given the importance of immune dysregulation in sepsis pathogenesis [47], the gut microbiome’s role in immune response to sepsis deserves further study.

Commensal members of the gut microbiome produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) which regulate several functions of the gut microenvironment [48]. For example, Clostridia and Faecalibacterium produce the SCFA butyrate, which influences colonic regulatory T cell differentiation through upregulation of Foxp3, a key regulatory T cell transcription factor [49], and inhibits histone deacetylation to decrease NF-κB-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6 [50].

In addition to their immune effects, SCFAs are crucial for epithelial cell function [51]. Acetate, produced by the gut commensal Bifidobacterium, protected mice from intestinal E. coli translocation through its effect on epithelial cell function [52]. Epithelial cell metabolism of butyrate decreases tissue oxygen concentration, thereby stabilizing HIF-1, a transcription factor that regulates several genes important for barrier function [53]. Preliminary data indicate that lower abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria may be a risk factor for sepsis onset [12], and increased gut membrane permeability is one plausible explanation that requires validation. For example, elevated serum markers of gut permeability including zonulin and FABP2 are associated with a gut microbiome with predominant gram negatives [54], but if these markers are elevated prior to sepsis onset in association with microbiome disruption is unknown.

As described above, alterations in the gut microbiome can predispose to sepsis by allowing for proliferation of pathobionts, promoting a dysregulated immune response, and decreasing production of beneficial SCFAs. Gut microbiome changes not only affect outcomes prior to sepsis onset: after sepsis onset, alterations in normal gut microbiome structure can worsen and contribute to worse outcomes (Fig. 1).

In addition to allowing domination by organisms with significant pathogenic potential, alterations in microbiome function worsen detrimental changes seen prior to sepsis onset. For example, patients with sepsis have fewer fecal SCFAs [46, 64], which may worsen gut epithelial integrity and immune dysfunction seen in sepsis [4, 47]. No studies have tracked longitudinal microbiome changes in sepsis survivors after discharge from the hospital to determine how long these microbiome changes persist. However, preliminary studies indicate that decreased SCFA concentrations last through at least 6 weeks of hospitalization, corresponding with persistent pathobiont colonization [64].

Sepsis affects end-organ damage through several mechanisms, including alterations in gut microbiome structure and function. Gut microbiome-derived SCFAs protected against acute kidney injury (AKI) in a mouse model of sepsis [65] and a specific gut microbiome composition decreased liver injury in a separate experiment [21]. Fascinatingly, the gut microbiome appears to impact delirium not only indirectly via inflammatory pathways, but also by bacterial translocation to the brains of septic patients with gut-derived bacteria [41, 44]. In an animal experiment on sepsis-induced delirium, mice with sepsis had decreased microbiome diversity and more severe neurocognitive damage, including more seizures, and FMT lessened the detrimental neurologic impact [41].

Despite increasing evidence that the gut microbiome affects end-organ damage in non-human studies and in diseases other than sepsis, only one small study in humans has looked at whether gut microbiome features (including decreased diversity and changes in composition) are associated with end-organ dysfunction in sepsis, including AKI and ARDS, and did not identify an effect on these outcomes [59]. Gut microbiome composition with fewer total obligate anaerobes [63] and abundant Enterococcus [17] at sepsis onset have been associated with mortality, whereas other studies have shown that microbiome diversity does not appear to be associated with mortality in sepsis [17, 59, 61]. In some of these studies, not all patients had sepsis, and sepsis patients were not analyzed as a subset [17, 59, 61]. Further studies designed to specifically track adverse outcomes in sepsis are needed to characterize the impact of gut microbiome changes, both composition and diversity, on sepsis outcomes.

The past 30 years have seen increasing interest in targeting the gut microbiome to improve outcomes of critically ill patients. One microbiome-related approach to preventing sepsis from MDR bacteria has involved “selective” oral or digestive decontamination using oral or parenteral antimicrobials with theoretical activity against many resistant healthcare-associated pathogens [69, 70]. Although some data do not show significant long-term effects of these strategies [71], concern for re-colonization with MDR bacteria soon after treatment discontinuation and undesired selection for even more resistant organisms in the microbiome has limited uptake of selective oral and digestive decontamination [70, 72].

Previous studies have focused largely on probiotics containing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, but several other next-generation probiotic species appear promising in pre-clinical studies. Akkermansia, for example, is associated with increased sepsis survival in mice [37]; in a separate study, Akkermansia directed T cell differentiation [78], providing one mechanism by which Akkermansia may improve sepsis outcomes. Probiotic “consortia,” i.e., groups of probiotics, can theoretically be manufactured to achieve specific synergistic effects. For example, one probiotic consortium degraded ampicillin and decreased colonization with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in antibiotic-treated mice [79]; it is plausible that this could decrease subsequent VRE bacteremia. More mechanistic studies are needed to determine the impact of specific next-generation probiotic species and consortia prior to translating these findings into probiotics for patients with or at risk of sepsis.

While probiotics and synbiotics contain only one or a small number of bacterial species, FMT potentially allows for colonization of an entire donor gut microbiome in a recipient. Therefore, FMT may allow for more robust microbiome reconstitution and impact sepsis outcomes through several mechanisms including SCFA production and immune regulation.

Although these case reports are intriguing, FMT for sepsis is clearly preliminary. Research to identify patients who may benefit and effect on patient-centered outcomes could inform its utility in broader application for sepsis. Additionally, multiple recent reports of E. coli infections acquired via FMT, including several resulting in death, highlight the need for careful donor screening, especially in patients with significant medical comorbidities [83, 84].

Gut microbiome disruption appears to be a risk factor for sepsis and subsequent organ dysfunction. The gut microbiome affects host susceptibility and response to sepsis through a number of pathways. Specifically, fewer beneficial taxa allow for pathobiont colonization and alter host immune response and SCFA production. A direct link between abnormal gut microbiome development and sepsis risk has been established in neonates. However, there are several aspects of the relationship between the gut microbiome and sepsis that require further study (Table 3). In adults, there is evidence of a correlation between gut microbiome alteration and sepsis risk; however, the potential confounders require further investigation. Once sepsis develops, the gut microbiome appears to effect end-organ dysfunction including ARDS and delirium, although mechanisms require further validation. Lastly, strategies to alter the gut microbiome, including FMT, either prior to sepsis onset or during the course of sepsis may be beneficial for selected patients with significant change in microbiome structure and function. Before further uptake of FMT in sepsis, several factors including patient selection, timing, and optimal route of administration require further research. Hopefully, improved mechanistic insights into the interaction between the gut microbiome and sepsis will allow for development of novel microbiome-based therapeutics to mitigate sepsis morbidity and mortality.
