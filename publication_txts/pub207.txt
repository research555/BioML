The role of the gut microbiome in sex differences in arterial pressure



There has been intense interest in the role of the gut microbiome in human health and a broad range of diseases in recent years. In the context of cardiovascular disease, gut dysbiosis (defined as a change in the gut microbiome and the gut-epithelial barrier) has been linked to disturbances in blood pressure (BP) regulation. These findings build upon our understanding of the complex pathophysiology of essential hypertension. There are clear sex differences in the epidemiology of hypertension, with distinct trends in BP across the life-course in men and women. To date, a role for the gut microbiome in contributing to the sex differences in BP is yet to be clearly established. The purpose of this review is to summarise the current literature regarding how the gut microbiome differs between men and women and to investigate whether sex-determined differences in the gut microbiome influence the response to factors such as diet, obesity and inflammation. Finally, we will explore evidence for the possible interaction between sex-specific factors, including sex hormones and pregnancy, with the gut in the context of hypertension pathophysiology.

Intense interest has been directed towards the role of microbes that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract in maintaining both health and disease states. With sophisticated culture-free methods, the genomes of the microbes in the intestine, termed the gut microbiome, can be characterised. This microbiome has been demonstrated to play roles in immunity, endocrine signalling and metabolism, amongst others [1]. Alterations to the gut microbiome and epithelial barrier, termed ‘dysbiosis’, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, where faecal microbiota transplants have been successfully used as treatment [2]. Furthermore, alterations to the gut microbiome have been demonstrated to play a role in other inflammatory diseases such as asthma and allergy and more recently in diseases beyond the gastrointestinal tract, such as hypertension [3], which will be the focus of this review.

Essential hypertension displays considerable variability in its phenotypic expression and in its consequences. Amongst these, considerable sex differences in the epidemiology and drivers of hypertension [6] and cardiovascular disease more broadly [7, 8] are apparent. The recognition that sex differences exist in cardiovascular pathology and treatment responses has fostered a recognition of the importance of understanding the impact of sex on disease expression via basic and clinical studies [9]. On the basis of the foregoing, this review aims to examine the evidence for sex differences in the gut microbiome, and to explore whether this may play a role in the sexual dimorphism observed in the regulation of blood pressure (BP).

Epidemiologic studies of hypertension indicate that there are substantial sex differences in distribution (summarised in Fig. 1). The prevalence of hypertension is higher in men than in women until approximately age 65, after which the prevalence becomes higher in women (81.2 vs. 73.4% in ≥ 75-year-olds) [10]. This is accompanied by greater BP variability on ambulatory 24 h BP monitoring in elderly women than men, which conveys a higher risk of end-organ damage [11]. The higher relative prevalence of hypertension in elderly women may be partially related to premature death of hypertensive males prior to the age of 75 [6]. However, there are also substantial changes to cardio-renal mechanisms with menopause that affect women’s cardiovascular risk and prevalence of hypertension. Endogenous oestrogen has an established protective role against the development of hypertension, with effects on vasodilation that are oestrogen receptor-dependent and receptor-independent [12, 13]. These include generation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide [14], opening of calcium-activated potassium channels [15], increasing the synthesis of cyclic AMP and adenosine [16], prostacyclin production [17], and reducing the synthesis of vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II (Ang II) [18]. Conversely, endogenous testosterone is considered to be a driver of hypertension, largely responsible for a greater rise in BP after puberty in boys compared to girls [13].

Understanding the drivers of sex differences in BP regulation is particularly important in the context of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), a disease where women are overrepresented amongst patients. Hypertension is a key player in the development of HFpEF, as it results in increased vascular stiffening, which leads to concentric remodelling and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. These seem to be exacerbated in women [8]. Similarly, the association between elevated BP and ischaemic stroke risk is higher in women. Furthermore, hypertension is a high-risk factor for other types of cardiovascular disease where substantial sex differences are evident, such as coronary artery disease [7] and coronary microvascular dysfunction [30].

Understanding the gut microbiome is made possible by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, which has ~ 1500 nucleotides and nine hypervariable regions that differ between different bacterial taxa. Studies typically report measures of diversity of microbial bacteria: α diversity indicates the richness (number of species present in a sample) and evenness (how evenly the microbial community’s taxa are distributed) of bacteria within a sample, with greater diversity being favourable; and β-diversity refers to the distance between samples in microbial taxa. There is mounting evidence for a clear association between the gut microbiome and BP, which has been reviewed in detail previously [3, 31]. Briefly, the main evidence for the involvement of the gut microbiome in BP regulation is that (1) essential hypertensive patients have a different gut microbiome compared to individuals with normal BP [32–34]; (2) faecal transplants from hypertensive subjects to gnotobiotic (i.e. germ-free, GF) mice lead to a significant (~ 15 mmHg) increase in BP; (3) GF mice do not develop hypertension and vascular dysfunction in the presence of Ang II [35]; (4) the use of antibiotics is able to modulate BP in animal models [33, 36] and in a case-study [37]; (5) gut metabolites resultant of microbial fermentation of prebiotics such as resistant starches are cardio-protective and associated with lower BP [32, 38–40]; and (6) changes in the gut microbiome and its metabolites lead to transcriptome-wide changes in the kidney and the heart, supporting the existence of a gut-cardiorenal axis [38] and potentially of a gut-central nervous system axis [33, 36, 37, 41]. Together, these studies show that alterations to the gut microbiome and its metabolites are involved in BP regulation, by either protecting or supporting the development of hypertension.

Experimental data provides strong evidence for an interaction between the gut microbiome and BP. The possible mechanisms behind this are manifold [3], but inflammation seems to be central to this relationship (Fig. 2). For example, fibre and acetate contribute via downregulation of early growth response protein 1, which has roles in cardio-renal fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophy and inflammation; along with downregulation of interleukin-1, which is strongly pro-inflammatory, and relevant to cardiovascular disease [38]. The other SCFAs appear to have a similar anti-inflammatory roles. Inflammation has an established role in hypertension [45–47], and low-grade inflammation has also been implicated in treatment-resistant hypertension, via end-organ damage which perpetuates the hypertensive state [33]. The importance of inflammation in mediating Ang II induced hypertension and vascular dysfunction was elegantly demonstrated in the GF model: GF mice do not show high BP or inflammation when challenged with Ang II [35].

Despite clear epidemiologic and pathophysiologic differences in BP control in men and women, to date, only a limited number of studies have addressed the potential interaction between sex, the gut microbiome and hypertension. However, there is some evidence to support that the gut microbiota is different according to sex. In a large cohort from four European countries, at all ages, males had higher levels of bacteria from the genera Bacteroides and Prevotella than females [48], which may reflect diet and has been demonstrated to play a role in weight loss [49].

As discussed above, testosterone impacts on the gut microbiome, being largely responsible for the divergence in microbial signature between the sexes after puberty [57]. Accordingly, a decline in testosterone with ageing may adversely affect the gut microbiome in men. Changes in the gut microbiome are also able to influence testosterone levels [58], and similarly, the microbiome can influence levels of non-ovarian estrogens [65]. The contribution of the microbiome to levels of non-ovarian estrogens, which depend on deconjugation in the distal gut before re-entering the circulation via the portal system was investigated in a cohort of 25 men, 7 postmenopausal women, and 19 premenopausal women [65]. Men and postmenopausal women had similar oestrogen levels, whereas premenopausal women differed substantially [65]. When studied together, men and postmenopaual women had significant correlations between α diversity and oestrogen levels after adjusting for age, body mass index and sex [65]. These associations were not present in premenopausal women. They also demonstrated a clear relationship between low microbial diversity and enzymatic activity and greater faecal oestrogen excretion [65]. Thus, the gut microbiome is influenced by and modulates oestrogen and testosterone levels. Interactions between sex and the gut microbiome are summarised in Fig. 3.

Studies directly linking the impact of the gut microbiome on sex differences in BP and hypertension are scarce. Arterial stiffness is closely related to hypertension; it is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk and is particularly relevant to women, who see a marked rise in vascular stiffness after menopause, mirroring the rise in hypertension after menopause [66]. The decline in oestrogen clearly plays a central role in this relationship, but factors such as inflammation also contribute [67]. Furthermore, women are more sensitive to the adverse effects of arterial stiffening, with greater augmentation indices and adverse ventricular remodelling [68, 69]. The gold standard measure of arterial stiffness is carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), indicating the speed of propagation of the arterial pulse wave through the vasculature. It consistently predicts cardiovascular outcomes in the general population and subpopulations with hypertension and diabetes mellitus [67]. There is one study to date that investigated the role of the gut microbiome in altering arterial stiffness [70]. In this study, an analysis of the gut microbiome composition was performed together with metabolomic measures and PWV in 617 female twins from the TwinsUK registry, at mean age of 61 ± 7 years [70]. They found a significant association between α diversity and PWV, persisting after adjustment for age, BMI, mean arterial pressure and family relatedness [70]. Specific bacterial taxa were also negatively correlated with PWV, including members of the Ruminococcaceae and Rikenallaceae families, which are SCFA-producing bacteria [70]. The fact that these findings persisted after adjusting for inflammation as reflected by C-reactive protein levels, smoking/alcohol habits, physical activity, fibre and omega 3 intake, Mediterranean diet adherence, socioeconomic status and proton pump inhibitor use was compelling [70]. Furthermore, visceral fat or insulin resistance did not explain these associations. Whilst these two factors explained 1.8% of variation in arterial stiffness in this cohort, gut microbial diversity and metabolites explained 8.3% [70]. This study strengthens our knowledge of the relationship between the gut microbiome, inflammation and arterial stiffness and pressure in women [70]. Repeating this study with the inclusion of a male cohort, along with premenopausal women and age-matched men would help to establish the contribution of the gut microbiome to sex differences in arterial stiffness and pressure.

To our knowledge, there are just two studies examining differences in the gut microbiome in the context of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Pathogenic bacteria Bulleidia moorei and Clostridium perfringens were increased in preeclampsia in 26 women in late pregnancy compared to 74 healthy women evenly split across early, middle and late pregnancy [71]. Conversely, the beneficial bacteria Coprococcus cactus, which plays a role in SCFA production, was reduced in preeclampsia [71]. There were, however, no statistically significant differences in α and β diversity and abundance differed between groups. A study of 205 overweight and obese women at 16 weeks gestation investigated the relationship between the gut microbiome and BP in pregnancy, finding a negative correlation between systolic and diastolic BP and Odoribacteraceae and Clostridiaceae families, both of which are butyrate producers [72]. Furthermore, Odoribacter abundance correlated negatively with the inflammatory marker plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, which has increased expression in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preeclampsia [72]. Together, these studies are suggestive of a role for the gut microbiome and SCFAs in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Further research is required to better characterise this relationship and determine the use of SCFAs as therapy.

The hypothesis that the gut microbiome is a player in determining sex differences in arterial pressure is supported by the fact that there are clear dimorphisms in the immune system between men and women [73], and the relationship between the microbiome and immune function is substantial [74]. However, these conclusions are largely based on associative studies, and the role of the microbiome in driving sex differences in arterial pressure has not been specifically studied to date. There is significant scope for further exploration of the role of the gut microbiome in sex differences in BP, hypertension and cardiovascular risk, particularly in regards to the interaction between the microbiome and ageing in men and women including menopause (Table 1) and for the consideration of sex-specific anti-hypertensive therapies that take into account the role of the gut microbiota.

Evidence continues to expand for a role of the gut microbiota in modulating essential hypertension, BP and arterial stiffness. There are bidirectional interactions between sex hormones and the gut microbiome, as well as a role for sex in the relationship between the gut microbiome and BMI, diet and immune pathways. However, how the gut microbiome modulates sex differences in BP is yet to be specifically examined, and should be the subject of further research. These should be done alongside studies to investigate whether the gut microbiome plays a role in hypertension during pregnancy, and if it has potential to be manipulated as therapy. Furthermore, whilst analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene has facilitated the rapid expansion of our knowledge of the gut microbiome, future studies should investigate the role of archaea, viruses (particularly bacteriophages) and fungi in the development of hypertension, as these might also be sex-specific.
