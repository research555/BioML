Role of lung and gut microbiota on lung cancer pathogenesis

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide (Ferlay et al., Int J Cancer 136:E359–386, 2015). In addition, lung cancer is associated with the highest mortality among all cancer types (Wu et al., Exp Ther Med 16:3004–3010, 2018). Previous studies report that microbiota play an important role in lung cancer. Notably, changes in lung and gut microbiota, are associated with progression of lung cancer. Several studies report that lung and gut microbiome promote lung cancer initiation and development by modulating metabolic pathways, inhibiting the function of immune cells, and producing pro-inflammatory factors. In addition, some factors such as microbiota dysbiosis, affect production of bacteriotoxins, genotoxicity and virulence effect, therefore, they play a key role in cancer progression. These findings imply that lung and gut microbiome are potential markers and targets for lung cancer. However, the role of microbiota in development and progression of lung cancer has not been fully explored.

The aim of this study was to systemically review recent research findings on relationship of lung and gut microbiota with lung cancer. In addition, we explored gut–lung axis and potential mechanisms of lung and gut microbiota in modulating lung cancer progression.

Pulmonary and intestinal flora influence the occurrence, development, treatment and prognosis of lung cancer, and will provide novel strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of lung cancer.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The morphological, etiology and molecular characteristics of cancer have been widely explored (Aisner and Marshall 2012). In addition to genetic and environmental factors, microbiota play an important role in development of lung cancer. Microorganisms that occur in the human body are referred as “microbial communities”. Several microorganisms occur in human body and play a role in maintaining the dynamic and stable microenvironment in the host body. Although microbial communities are essential to human health, they can have detrimental effects on human health when the homeostasis is disturbed. Dysregulation of the microbiome is implicated in different diseases. Studies report that imbalance of microbial communities in specific organs is directly or indirectly associated with carcinogenesis (Garrett 2015; Khan et al. 2012). Microbiome dysbiosis affects susceptibility to carcinogenesis through multiple ways including modulation of the host inflammatory response, production of carcinogenic metabolic products, genotoxic and virulence effects and disruption of cell cycle (Mao et al. 2018). Microorganisms inhabit the gastro intestinal tract (GIT), lungs, skin, and other organs, with the gastro intestinal tract having the highest density of microorganisms. Microbial communities cause effects on the organs that they occur in and distant organs. Gut microbiome plays a crucial role in several diseases (Jobin 2012) especially in cancer. Moreover, gut microbiota may have important implications in the immune checkpoints treatment response and response to chemotherapy in NSCLC (Hakozaki et al. 2020). The role of lung microbiota in pulmonary disease has been widely explored through the recent advances in understanding of the respiratory immune system. Several recent studies have explored the relationship between lung microbiome and lung cancer (Dickson and Huffnagle 2015; Dickson et al. 2014b). In addition, the gut and lung form the gut–lung axis through complex bidirectional lymphatic and blood communication (Bingula et al. 2017). Therefore, we explored the correlation of lung and gut microbiota with development of lung cancer, and the effect of gut microbiome to therapy response of lung cancer. In addition, we explored the role of the gut–lung axis in carcinogenesis to provide new insights on the lung cancer pathogenesis. The study findings show that lung and gut microbes can be used as biomarkers for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer.

Traditionally, the lung was considered a sterile space. However, several studies report that unique microbial communities inhabit the lungs (Beck et al. 2012). Studies using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, both in physiological and pathological conditions showed that the lung hosts diverse microbiota. The microbiome of the lung mucous membrane is phylogenetically diverse (Erb-Downward et al. 2011; Hilty et al. 2010), compared with upper airways. A significantly lower number of bacteria inhabit lungs and lower respiratory systems compared with the gut (Segal and Blaser 2014). Lung microbiota has two dominating bacterial phyla in healthy adults including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes (Morris et al. 2013; Segal et al. 2013). In addition, recent studies report that Prevotella and Veillonella inhabit healthy lungs (Hilty et al. 2010). Bacteria communities that inhabit lower respiratory system mainly include: Megasphaera, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Fusobacterium and Sphingomonas (Beck et al. 2012; Hilty et al. 2010). A recent study explored lung microbiota using surgical lung tissue samples reported that lung microbiota is unique, with Proteobacteria as the dominant phylum (Yu et al. 2016). Several microbial ecosystem studies using a wide range of biological samples such as sputum, lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid report that human lung comprises a diverse and low-density ecosystem of microbes. Several factors such as local conditions, migration of microorganisms down from the upper airways, and disposal of microorganisms by human affect microbiota composition (Dickson et al. 2014a). In healthy lungs, microbiota composition reflects microbial migration, reproduction, and elimination. Low concentrations of pulmonary microbiota are implicated in modulation of the immune system. An unbalanced ecosystem in the lungs may occur present as chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD, and may cause to pathogenesis of systemic diseases.

Studies should explore pulmonary microbial community as diagnostic and therapeutic markers of lung cancer. Although studies report association of lung microbiota with lung cancer, the mechanisms by which the pulmonary microbiome and the tumor interact have not been fully explored. Understanding the mechanism will provide information on the etiopathogenesis of lung cancer. Moreover, studies should design a method to accurately control systematic biases from sampling types and environmental contaminant. Different specimen types, such as lung tissues, sputum, BAL fluid and bronchoscopic samples may contain different microorganism types affecting results, therefore, it is important to establish unified standards using different sample collection and processing methods. Furthermore, sample sizes of some lung microbiome studies are too small, therefore, further large-scaled studies with longitudinal design and larger sample sizes should be carried out to identify and validate microbial biomarkers and explore microbiota-associated pathogenesis of lung cancer (Table. 1).

Intestinal flora is the general term for all kinds of bacteria that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract. Intestinal flora is widely distributed, complex and diverse microbial community. Intestinal flora maintain normal physiological and immune functions of the host intestinal tract, and catabolize food components making them easier to absorb. Gut microbiota has systemic effects on host physiology and health (Dickson et al. 2013; He et al. 2017; Samuelson et al. 2015; Tsay et al. 2011). Changes in intestinal flora composition (dysregulation), function, or interaction between the flora and the host are directly associated with several diseases. Several studies have explored the relationship between intestinal flora and various tumors. For instance, a previous study explored the role of gut microbiota in extra-gastrointestinal tumors (Fernández et al. 2018; Raza et al. 2019). In addition, studies report a relationship between lung cancer and gut microbiota (Gui et al. 2015; Routy et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018).

Change in diversity of gut is potential biomarker for diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer (Bai et al. 2019). However, the role of gut microbiome in development and progression of lung cancer should be explored further. In addition, role of microbiome in modulating the effectiveness of anti-cancer treatment should be analyzed further (Table. 2).

Although gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts are distant physically, they have the same embryonic origin and high similarity in structure, implying that the two sites might interact in multiple aspects. There is a clear cross-talk between gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts known as gut–lung axis, which was reported recently. Studies report that intestines and lungs interact with each other through microbial and immune functions to achieve two-way regulation. Gut and lung microbes show similar colonization characteristics in early days of life, and gut and lungs have strong mucosal defense system against microbes. Furthermore, intestinal mucosa and pulmonary mucosa show several similarities after differentiation. For example, intestinal mucosa goblet cells can secrete IgA, whereas goblet cells of respiratory mucosa can also produce IgA. In addition, studies report that lung and intestines can affect each other’s immunity (Gill et al. 2010). Previous studies report that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) which are the major metabolic products of gut microbiota from dietary fiber, have a mediating role of the gut microbiome’s immune function, in an allergy model, and can regulate lung immunity (Cait et al. 2018; Trompette et al. 2014). Moreover, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (Gray et al. 2017) and immune cells such as TREG cells regulate pulmonary immune response, thus affecting the microbes that colonize lungs (Samuelson et al. 2015). Gut microbiota can therefore, activate B and T cells and other immune cells, which infiltrate the lungs through hematogenous or lymphatic routes, and activate lung immune response. As a result, they induce numerous respiratory diseases, such as COPD, cystic fibrosis, respiratory infection and asthma (Bingula et al. 2017; Budden et al. 2017; Marsland et al. 2015; Shukla et al. 2017). Studies report that lung flora can affect intestinal flora through circulation of the blood (Renz et al. 2011). Gut and lung microbiota are linked to each other by a complex bidirectional axis through lymphatic (Bingula et al. 2017) and blood circulation system. For example, Streptococcus pneumoniae infected mice treated with antibiotics, showed that administration of healthy mice feces suspension can relieve symptoms of pneumonia. Oral administration of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium alleviates symptoms of childhood asthma and reduces seizure frequency. A study based on responses of Th17 cells, reported that viral infection in the lung induces intestinal injury (Wang et al. 2014). These findings show that changes in intestinal microorganisms affect immune responses in lungs and transformation of pulmonary diseases (Budden et al. 2017).

However, the mechanism underlying the role of gut–lung axis in pathogenesis and progression of lung cancer and the potential for manipulation of the gut–lung axis in the treatment of lung cancer should be explored further. These studies show that lung bacterial represents a major component of the lung tumor microenvironment and the gut–lung axis allows indirect modification of lung bacterial composition through gut microbiota modification strategies, such as fecal transplantation. A previous study reports that TNF-α induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition thus promoting lung cancer metastasis (Shang et al. 2017). Bifidobacterium, a representative of intestinal probiotics has multiple physiological activities, which are protective against TNF-α and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induced inflammatory thus conferring anti-cancer effects (Boesten et al. 2011). Gut or lung microbiota modification strategies, such as a direct translocation of bacteria from one site to the other, release of bacteria-derived immunomodulatory molecules into the blood stream and the lymphatic system thus affecting systemic immunity, can be used to achieve dynamic crosstalk between the two sites (Barfod et al. 2013; Milani et al. 2017; Schuijt et al. 2016; Vallès et al. 2014). Crosstalk between the microbiota of gut–lung axis provide potential new therapeutic targets for lung cancer. However, the underlying mechanism of the connection between the gut–lung axis and lung cancer should be explored further.

The human body is a complex habitat for diverse microorganisms. The human flora helps to maintain the overall homeostasis of the host. Pulmonary and intestinal flora influence the occurrence, development, treatment and prognosis of lung cancer. Changes in lung and gut microbial functions and microbiome associated molecular patterns (MAMPS) caused by immune processes, inflammation, and bacterial dysbiosis are the driving mechanisms of lung cancer. Thus, the role of gut–lung axis in the pathogenesis of lung cancer get has attracted huge attention. Moreover, future randomized controlled trials and real world studies should be conducted with improved methodologies to determine the clinical value of the microbiota-cancer relationship and elucidate how the microbiome affects lung cancer. This will reveal promising diagnostic and therapeutic avenues. We hope that lung and gut microbes can be used as biomarkers for the assessment of the progression and guide the treatment of lung cancer, as well as provide alternative targets for cancer prevention. It also can be expected that “design probiotics” and other means to regulate the flora, so as to improve the curative effect and prognosis of lung cancer patients.
