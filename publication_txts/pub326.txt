A Novel View of Human Helicobacter pylori Infections: Interplay between Microbiota and Beta-Defensins

The gut microbiota is significantly involved in the preservation of the immune system of the host, protecting it against the pathogenic bacteria of the stomach. The correlation between gut microbiota and the host response supports human gastric homeostasis. Gut microbes may be shifted in Helicobacter pylori (Hp)-infected individuals to advance gastric inflammation and distinguished diseases. Particularly interesting is the establishment of cooperation between gut microbiota and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) of the host in the gastrointestinal tract. AMPs have great importance in the innate immune reactions to Hp and participate in conservative co-evolution with an intricate microbiome. β-Defensins, a class of short, cationic, arginine-rich proteins belonging to the AMP group, are produced by epithelial and immunological cells. Their expression is enhanced during Hp infection. In this review, we discuss the impact of the gut microbiome on the host response, with particular regard to β-defensins in Hp-associated infections. In microbial infections, mostly in precancerous lesions induced by Hp infection, these modifications could lead to different outcomes.

Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infections are related to the onset of various gut diseases, such as gastritis, gastric cancer, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALT) [1,2,3]. Different studies have been developed to understand how Hp can cause local and systemic effects on the human host. An important mechanism involved in these effects is probably injury to the host as a result of chronic inflammation [4]. Recently, various studies have started to concentrate on the impact of Hp and its metabolism on the gut microbiome [5,6,7,8]. This rising area could partly elucidate the large heterogeneity of results that are, at present, due to the infection of Hp in the host.

This review describes the effects of the gastrointestinal microbiome on the host response, with particular regard to the role of β-defensins in Hp-related infections.

Hp infection is acquired throughout babyhood through intrafamilial transmission, and in many cases, it proceeds, unless removed by antibiotic treatment [9]. Chronic infection by Hp results in mucosal gastric inflammation, which is devoid of clinical symptoms in most infected subjects. Only a minority of infected people develop severe gastroduodenal diseases [10]. Among these infected individuals, about 10% develops ulcers, 1–3% develop gastric carcinoma, and fewer than 0.1% develop gastric MALT (Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma).

For example, Lactobacillus, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus, can produce N-nitroso compounds [18,19]. On the contrary, Streptococcus, Prevotella, and Neisseria commensals are related to a poor risk of development of gastric cancer [20,21] (Table 1).

The microbiome represents the whole microbial community present in the body of a defined host. In humans, the microbiome contains bacteria, viruses, fungi, and Archeae [22,23,24]. The microbiome mutates profoundly among subjects, and colonization by particular microbes could confer protection or susceptibility to disease, especially in chronic infections related to Hp [25].

In addition, an analysis of the gastric microbiota showed comparable settlement in control individuals from diverse cultural groups and different geographic backgrounds [32].

Hp can cause alterations in the host by modifying the gut microbiome. A growing number of studies is reporting greater ecosystem diversity in the gastrointestinal tract and associating the presence of Hp with variations within the structure of the microbiome [33,34,35,36,37,38,39].

In Mongolian gerbils, chronic Hp infection causes degenerative alterations. These alterations occur with variation in the expression of genes linked to immunity in both the stomach and respiratory organs [56]. Perhaps, premature settlement changes could lead to alterations in the hollow microenvironment, while late ones could be conducted by an additional shift in the inflammatory and immune response primed by Hp [57]. It is possible that Hp may have an effect on mucosal diseases in remote sites through its impact on immune cells that move through the body’s circulation. Hp even provokes a change in the immune reaction through the elicitation of Treg cells (regulatory T cells) with VacA (vacuolating cytotoxin A) and GGT (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) intermediates [58,59]. Treg cell reactions are critical for the discrimination between self and foreign antigens, i.e., immune tolerance. This discovery may explain the persistence of Hp in the stomach and could also help suppress gastric inflammation, which may justify a reduction in the severity of gastric disease in Hp-positive children related to Hp-positive adults [42]. The infection by Hp in the stomach has been correlated with modifications of the gastrointestinal microbiome at alternative places in the organism. Reasonably, alternative members of gut microbiota can also contribute to changes discovered after Hp infection by the host. In fact, there is a direct interaction between Hp and Streptococcus mitis that causes the passage of Hp from a spiral to coccoid shape that is most refractory to stressful environments [60]. In addition, antimicrobial molecules made by Lactobacillus spp. are active against Hp strains [61,62,63]. Therefore, there is a two-way communication and modulation between Hp and other constituents of the microbiota and, consequently, the set of these influences will be reflected by the health of the host [64]. In this way, changes in the microbiome triggered by the first acquisition of Hp could also confirm the immunological status of the host and, as a result, the occurrence of many general diseases. This is relevant, since once the microbiota is altered by treatment with antibiotics, Hp-induced inflammation is reduced [42].

The host’s metabolism is affected by Hp and gut microbiota. The impact of Hp infection on modifications to the gastro-intestinal microbiota has been examined in animals and humans [65,66,67].

The predominance of non-Hp microbes was found to be greater in subjects with non-ulcerative dyspepsia than in those with peptic ulcers. Instead, the isolation of Streptococci and not of Hp has been correlated with the development of peptic ulcers [68,69].

As well as Hp presence, the structure of the gut microbiota could be altered by diet, lifestyle, medication use, age, exercise, and genetic factors [68,69,70,71,72,73,74] (Figure 2).

Dietary factors considerably change both the function and the composition of gut microbiota. A landmark study investigated the microbiota of Italian and countryside African children. Prominent exhaustion of Enterobacteriaceae and Firmicutes and, remarkably, more short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were found to occur in African children.

Foods of animal origin were shown to promote the growth of bile-tolerant bacteria microorganisms, while the ability of Firmicutes to process the polysaccharides of vegetal foods was diminished. This study highlights a significative correlation between bile acids, saturated milk fats, and excessive proliferation of some proinflammatory microorganisms such as Bilophila wadsworthia [75,76,77,78], which is associated with chronic inflammatory diseases [76]. Substantial shifts in the microbial constitution of the intestines were observed during the change to a high fat diet (HFD) with a reduction in the phylum Bacteroidetes and increases in the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Furthermore, the consumption of red meat was correlated not only with a poor grade of inflammation, but also with a particular microbiome in subjects with late adenoma and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) [77].

The proton pump inhibitor (PPI) produces a significant decrease in gastric pH, and the constitution of the gut microbiota is more similar to the fecal one than that of the H2 antagonists and the untreated control [79]. Treatment with antibiotics induces modifications in the gastric microbiota and an imbalance between Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. The diversity and abundance of these bacteria decrease during antibiotic treatments. The alterations of the microbiome depend on the type of antibiotic used, the dosage, the time of administration, the pharmacological action and the target bacteria. Antimicrobial results or modalities of functioning are crucial for the sorting of gut microbiota and are a reliable way of assessing the composition of microbial alterations during antibiotic treatment [80,81,82].

With age, the microbiota diversity increases until it becomes a stable adult microbiota. Three bacterial phyla dominate the composition, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, which is influenced by genetic factors, diet, environment, lifestyle, and gut physiology.

In children, the gut microbiota composition and diversity are like those of adults by about three years of age [83,84].

In young children and adolescents, daily exercise increases gut microbial diversity with the enrichment of Firmicutes, such as Clostridiales, Roseburia, Lachnospiraceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae. These microbes generate SCFAs that can enhance the levels of tight junctions in the gastrointestinal tract to improve colon barrier solidity, reduce mucosa permeability, and inhibit inflammation triggered by cytokines [84,85].

In athletes, higher alpha diversity of gut microorganisms has been demonstrated compared with high and low body mass index (BMI) controls. Indeed, this study showed that exercise elevates gut microbial diversity and protein depletion. Therefore, there is a beneficial impact of activity on the variations of gut microbiota, and the correlation between physical activity and microbiota diversity is probably related to the concomitant dietary extremes [86].

Genetic aspects of the host are able to affect the gastrointestinal microbiota and its metabolic phenotype.

In contrast, in twins, only a small percentage (about 2–8%) of the microbiome taxa is heritable [92].

Defensins are short proteins belonging to the mammalian antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) family. These proteins have a large range of antimicrobial activity against bacterial cells, viruses, fungi, and protozoa [93,94,95,96].

Additionally, PPARs activate HBD-1 mediated immunity in Crohn’s disease, which constitutes another intestinal anti-inflammatory mechanism [108].

Defensins have an essential role in the onset of Hp-infections. The distribution of the resulting gastritis is influenced by genetic factors, bacterial virulence, the age of infection, and the environment [112]. Hp infection drives a more important increase in HBD-2 than non-Hp gastritis [113]. Furthermore, Hp induces endogenous HBD-2 expression from gastric epithelial cells, and this improvement is regulated by the recognition receptor NOD1 (Nucleotide Binding Ligand Domain 1) [114]. In Hp-induced gastritis, there are essential increases in HBD-1 and HBD-2 expression with respect to the control. The same increases in HBD1 and HBD-2 expression were detected during bacterial inflammation, suggesting an essential role of innate host defense against potentially injurious stimuli in the stomach [115]. Moreover, subjects with Hp-infected gastritis overexpresses HBD-2 mRNA, while those who are Hp-negative show only weak HBD-2 expression, indicating that the presence of Hp enhances HBD-2 expression in the gut. Besides, there is a marked diversity in HBD-2 expression in the gastric corpus of Hp individuals related to those who are Hp-negative. In addition, HBD-1 is expressed unevenly, further indicating the failure of transcriptional regulators for pro-inflammatory markers in the HBD-1 gene [116].

There is a robust correlation between Hp infection and peptic ulcers. Peptic ulcers represent gaps in the covering of the gastrointestinal mucosa that are usually produced by Hp and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicaments. A peptic ulcer is linked with significative mortality and complications such as bleeding and perforation. Individuals with a peptic ulcer have less HBD-1 and greater HBD-2 expression than those with a healthy stomach, and this model is particularly marked in individuals infected with Hp. Probably, this increased expression of HBD-2 constitutes a protective reaction by the gastric epithelium to restrict the infection [119].

AMPs have a notable impact on the constitution of the gastrointestinal microbiota. The power to elude them has given some pathogens selective supremacy [120,121]. This is especially evident in the case of Hp, which uses the cholesterol of the host to obtain resistance against catelicidin-37 (LL-37) [122].

The gut microbiota can regulate the production of defensins that rapidly kill or deactivate microorganisms [132]. Evidence shows that, in host protection, defensins collaborate with various mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, supplements, and more antimicrobial proteins, as well as cellular elements, to produce coordinate protection against invading pathogens [133].

Hp has a powerful impact on both the stomach habitat and the immune status of the host, leading to alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiome at disparate sites in the organism. These changes are greatly implicated in the pathogenicity of Hp-associated diseases. AMPs are meaningfully involved in the preservation of the solidity and equilibrium of the gastrointestinal tract. Knowledge of microbial-dependent or -independent factors that influence the expression of AMPs is essential and could lead to new therapeutic approaches to diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) correlated with pathogenic colonization and disequilibrium of the host microbiota. Thus, knowledge of the mechanisms involved in these processes, as well as the Hp-induced microbiome changes that may be connected to the progress of illness, will probably be helpful in predicting and avoiding Hp-related diseases. After forming a mechanistic understanding of animal models, reports on the microbiome will open up a new area of study for the clinical government.
