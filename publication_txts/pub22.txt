Emerging trends and focus of human gastrointestinal microbiome research from 2010–2021: a visualized study

The gastrointestinal microbiome is an important component of the human body and is closely related to human health and disease. This study describes the hotspots of the human gastrointestinal microbiome research and its evolution in the past decade, evaluates the scientific cooperation network, and finally predicts the field’s future development trend using bibliometric analysis and a visualized study.

We searched the original articles from January 2010 to February 2021 in the Scopus database using the term “gastrointestinal microbiome” and its synonyms. CiteSpace was used to construct country and author co-occurrence map; conduct journal, citation cocitation analysis, and reference co-citation knowledge map; and form a keywords co-occurrence map, a clustering knowledge map, timeline view of keywords, and burst term map.

A total of 4444 documents published from January 2010 to February 2021 were analysed. In approximately the past decade, the number of articles on the human gastrointestinal microbiome has increased rapidly, and the research topics focus on different populations, research methods, and detection methods. All countries and regions in the world, led by the US, are studying the human gastrointestinal microbiome, and many research teams with close cooperation have been formed. The research has been published extensively in microbiology journals and clinical medicine journals, and the highly cited articles mainly describe the relationship between gastrointestinal microorganisms and human health and disease. Regarding the research emphasis, researchers' exploration of the human gastrointestinal microbiome (2011–2013) was at a relatively macro and superficial stage and sought to determine how the gastrointestinal microbiome relates to humans. From 2014 to 2017, increasingly more studies were conducted to determine the interaction between human gastrointestinal flora and various organs and systems. In addition, researchers (2018–2021) focused on the gastrointestinal microbial community and the diversity of certain types of microbes.

Over time, the scope of the research on the clinical uses of the gastrointestinal microbiome gradually increased, and the contents were gradually deepened and developed towards a more precise level. The study of the human gastrointestinal microbiome is an ongoing research hotspot and contributes to human health.

It is currently well appreciated that diverse microbial communities reside within the intestinal tract, on the skin, and on nearly all of the exposed surfaces of the human body [1]. The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract harbours the highest density and complexity of microbial organisms in the body [2], and the gastrointestinal microbiota has a level of complexity comparable to that of an organ system [3]. A key role of the gastrointestinal microbiome in the establishment and maintenance of health, as well as in the pathogenesis of diseases, has been identified over the past two decades [4]. In addition, the relationship between the gastrointestinal microbiome and populations with different ages and genders has been gradually revealed [5, 6]. An increasing number of gastrointestinal microbiome detection methods, such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) or Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), have also emerged [7, 8]. Importantly, the microbiome (including bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.) regulates health, and its alterations can contribute to disease [9]. A large number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that gastrointestinal microorganisms are interrelated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diabetes, hepatitis, and autism in humans [10–14]. For example, IBS can disturb the intestinal microecology, which may continue to aggravate IBS. Conversely, the improvement of the intestinal microecology using probiotics and other means may be conducive to the alleviation of the symptoms of IBS [15–17]. However, most research on the gastrointestinal microbiome is still in the stage of animal experiments, and the results of animal studies cannot be directly applied to humans. For instance, bidirectional microbiota-gut-brain communication has mostly been explored in animal models with human research lagging [18].

This study aims to visualize articles on the human gastrointestinal microbiome in the last ten years by using knowledge maps. We described the research hotspots of the human gastrointestinal microbiome and its evolution in the past decade, evaluated the scientific cooperation network, discussed the relationship between humans and gastrointestinal microbiomes, and predicted the field’s future development trend.

The literature data used in this study were downloaded from the Scopus database, which is widely accepted among researchers conducting high-quality bibliometric analyses [23–26]. We used “gastrointestinal microbiome” for topical retrieval and the following search queries in titles, abstracts, and keywords: (gastrointestinal AND microbiome), (gut AND microbiota), (gut AND flora), (intestinal AND microbial AND population), (intestinal AND microecology), (enteric AND microorganism), (gut AND microecology), and (intestinal AND microorganism). In addition, the time was defined as “2010–2021” without any language limitation. The above keywords were chosen from a list of Medical Subject Headings (MeSHs) provided by the National Library of Medicine (NLM)/PubMed. The literature type was defined as “articles”. Studies in the subject areas of veterinary, poultry science, soil biology, dentistry, engineering, material science, animal experiments, in vitro cell culture experiments, and secondary studies were excluded.

CiteSpace (Chaomei Chen, China), a freely available software tool for analysis, was used to make visualization maps in this study. Developed by Chaomei Chen in 2004 at Drexel University (USA), CiteSpace is usually used to analyze, detect and visualize trends and patterns in scientific literature [27]. The principle of the software includes coword analysis used to measure the number of occurrences of a group of words (keywords, authors, regions, and citations) in the same group of literature and to perform matrix analysis [28]. In this paper, we use CiteSpace 5.5.R2 to construct country and author co-occurrence map; conduct journal, citation cocitation analysis, and reference co-citation knowledge map; and form a keywords co-occurrence map, a clustering knowledge map, timeline view of keywords, and burst term map.

Overall, 4444 documents published from January 2010 to February 2021 were analysed. The number of annual documents during this period showed an exponential growth trend (y = 83.518e0.172x, R2 = 0.4625). The specific numbers of annual documents are shown in Fig. 1.

In the country co-occurrence knowledge map (Fig. 2), 4444 articles about the human gastrointestinal microbiome were published by research groups in 104 countries or regions. There are 105 nodes and 128 lines, and the centrality is 0.02. The landmark node includes the United States with a count of 1387, China with a count of 756, the United Kingdom with a count of 344, Italy with a count of 311, and Germany (263 texts). The turning points with more connections include Hong Kong, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Germany. The annual distribution trends in the top five most published countries was shown in Fig.
3. The United States has been leading the way in annual publication.

In the author’s co-occurrence knowledge map (Fig. 4), there are 588 nodes and 1233 lines, and the centrality is 0.007. The landmark nodes include Y Zhang, Y Wang, J Li, J Zhang, and Y Chen. The turning points with more connections include L Wang, L Li, X Yang, Y Chen, and J Wang.

A total of 1255 journals published the 4444 articles on the human gastrointestinal microbiome. We analyzed the top ten journals that published articles on the human gastrointestinal microbiome (Table
1), reference co-citation knowledge map (Fig. 5) and the details of the top ten articles with the most citations on the human gastrointestinal microbiome in the last ten years (Table
2).

The highly cited articles on the human gastrointestinal microbiome have been published in top journals such as Nature and Science. The topics of these literatures include the relationship between the human gastrointestinal microbiome and diet, diabetes, human health and metabolism, and microbiome analysis methods.

The articles were imported into CiteSpace, and the keywords were set as nodes. Through a series of software operations, the keyword co-occurrence knowledge map (Fig. 6), clustering knowledge map (Fig. 7), timeline view of keywords (Fig. 8), and keyword burst term map (Fig. 9) were obtained.

By combining the keyword clustering knowledge map (Fig. 7), timeline view (Fig. 8), and keyword burst map (Fig. 9), we found the evolutionary path of research hotspots. Amoxicillin treatment, vocabulary related to RCTs, the intestines, the gastrointestinal tract, lactobacillus, Escherichia coli, DNA, probiotics host gene regulation, and the metagenome began to attract attention in the early years (2010–2013). The middle stage (2014–2017) focused on microflora, complications, chemistry, newborns, normal humans, on-chronic liver failure, Japanese female patients, autism spectrum disorder, gastric cancer, and HIV-infected patients. In addition, in recent years (2018–2021), researchers have been interested in metagenomics, microbial communities, microbial diversity, inflammation, and other aspects.

The annual number of articles on the human gastrointestinal microbiome shows exponential growth (Fig. 1), indicating that this field is a research hotspot, and its popularity will continue to increase. This is consistent with previous studies [23, 39]. Researchers should give continuous attention to trends in related fields to uncover more connections between humans and the gastrointestinal microbiome. All countries and regions in the world have studied the human gastrointestinal microbiome (Fig. 2). The United States has the most publications, which may be related to the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) programme launched by the NIH in 2007 and the Gut Microbiota Brain AXIS programme in 2013 [40, 41]. The second most published country is China, which may be related to the importance attached to the study of the human microbiome mentioned by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the 14th Five-Year National Key Research and Development Plan of the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Outline of the 2035 Vision Goals [42–44]. Although China is the second largest publishing country, there are no Chinese journals in the top 10 journals, which indicates that China can strengthen its construction of periodicals in this field. The largest collaborator is J Zhang's team from Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Life Sci & Biotechnol in China, which focuses on probiotics and intestinal microorganisms. It is suggested that researchers from all countries continue to maintain close cooperation and share the latest research results on the human gastrointestinal microbiome.

There are some limitations to this study. In this study, only articles in the Scopus database were retrieved. Although using the Scopus database to conduct high-quality bibliometric analyses is widely accepted by researchers, it is still possible that some studies related to the human gastrointestinal microbiome have not been included, which may change the results of the study. This study examined only the last ten years of research on the human gastrointestinal microbiome, which may miss the development process of the human gastrointestinal microbiome from the start.

In this study, 4444 original studies from January 2010 to February 2021 related to the human gastrointestinal microbiome were downloaded from the Scopus database and analyzed using CiteSpace to generate knowledge maps. The number of articles on the human gastrointestinal microbiome has increased rapidly in the past decade, and the scientific cooperation network showed that cooperation between different countries and institutions has been sufficient. The research topics focus on different populations, research methods, and detection methods. In addition, the research scope has gradually increased over time, and the research content has been gradually deeper and moving towards precision medicine. In short, the study of the human gastrointestinal microbiome is an ongoing research hotspot and contributes to human health.
