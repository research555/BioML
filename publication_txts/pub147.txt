Could Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and Inclusion of Diet-Gut Microbiome Interactions Improve Disease Risk Prediction? Case Study: Coronary Artery Disease

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the main leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, posing a huge socio-economic burden to the society and health systems. Therefore, timely and precise identification of people at high risk of CAD is urgently required. Most current CAD risk prediction approaches are based on a small number of traditional risk factors (age, sex, diabetes, LDL and HDL cholesterol, smoking, systolic blood pressure) and are incompletely predictive across all patient groups, as CAD is a multi-factorial disease with complex etiology, considered to be driven by both genetic, as well as numerous environmental/lifestyle factors. Diet is one of the modifiable factors for improving lifestyle and disease prevention. However, the current rise in obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CVD/CAD indicates that the “one-size-fits-all” approach may not be efficient, due to significant variation in inter-individual responses. Recently, the gut microbiome has emerged as a potential and previously under-explored contributor to these variations. Hence, efficient integration of dietary and gut microbiome information alongside with genetic variations and clinical data holds a great promise to improve CAD risk prediction. Nevertheless, the highly complex nature of meals combined with the huge inter-individual variability of the gut microbiome poses several Big Data analytics challenges in modeling diet-gut microbiota interactions and integrating these within CAD risk prediction approaches for the development of personalized decision support systems (DSS). In this regard, the recent re-emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) is opening intriguing perspectives, as these approaches are able to capture large and complex matrices of data, incorporating their interactions and identifying both linear and non-linear relationships. In this Mini-Review, we consider (1) the most used AI/ML approaches and their different use cases for CAD risk prediction (2) modeling of the content, choice and impact of dietary factors on CAD risk; (3) classification of individuals by their gut microbiome composition into CAD cases vs. controls and (4) modeling of the diet-gut microbiome interactions and their impact on CAD risk. Finally, we provide an outlook for putting it all together for improved CAD risk predictions.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the main leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, posing a huge socio-economic burden to the society and health systems (Lopez et al., 2006). Currently, our health care system is facing a paradigm shift from a “one size fits all” approach to a more optimized model to identify prevention strategies and treatments tailored to each individual, the so called personalized medicine. Moreover, the vision of prevention has also transformed toward a concept of “positive health” and primordial prevention—the prevention of disease risk factors before they actually occur, i.e., through targeted modifications of person's environment/lifestyle (Movsisyan et al., 2020). Therefore, timely and precise identification of people at high risk of CAD is of utmost importance for the personalized cardiology (Alaa et al., 2019), as such persons may need more aggressive health promotion strategies, especially the modifiable CAD risk factors could be effectively reduced or even eliminated in this way (Movsisyan et al., 2020).

In this Mini Review, we explore, whether the inclusion of dietary factors and/or gut microbiome data in combination with the power of AI/ML could potentially improve CAD risk prediction. In particular, we consider: (1) the most used AI/ML approaches for CAD risk prediction; (2) the use cases of AI/ML approaches to model the content, choice and impact of dietary factors and how this could be used to predict CAD risk; (3) the use cases of AI/ML approaches to classify individuals by their gut microbiome composition into CAD cases vs. controls and to (4) model the diet-gut microbiome interactions and their impact on CAD risk (as illustrated in Figure 1 and summarized in Table 1). (5) Finally, we provide an outlook for putting it all together into a smart clinical decision support system (DSS), considering the traditional risk factors in combination with individual's genetic variations, as well as dietary factors and gut microbiome and discuss the potential of AI/ML based methods vs. conventional approaches for risk predictions.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) has recently caught the interest of both academia and industry, and the different approaches have been explicitly reviewed elsewhere, e.g., Cao et al., 2018; Goecks et al., 2020. Hence, we only give a very brief overview, highlighting some of the most popular and widely used approaches and common terminology in the field, to prepare the reader for the sections to follow.

This is were additional data layers such dietary factors and gut microbiome, as an integrator of this information (Bashiardes et al., 2018; Eetemadi et al., 2020), come in. However, only a few studies so far have used dietary factors (Alaa et al., 2019; Rigdon and Basu, 2019) or gut microbiome (Zhu et al., 2018; Aryal et al., 2020), and no studies using both (the closest being Zeevi et al., 2015 related to blood glucose levels), in combination with AI/ML for CAD risk prediction. We further discuss these few studies and also consider closely related research on dietary factors, gut microbiome and combinations of both in other disease settings vs. healthy individuals.

Dietary information is mainly collected via questionnaires, either through self-reporting or by a trained interviewer. For self-reporting, a food frequency questionnaire and dietary recall can be used, where participants report their meal intake either every 24 h or over a longer period through a checklist of food items (Eetemadi et al., 2020). At the same time, fitness apps are gaining increased popularity, as food logging can be performed during its consumption or even by capturing an image of the meal, thus the bias related to individual's memory can be reduced (Weber and Achananuparp, 2016; Verma et al., 2018; Eetemadi et al., 2020). Clearly, such food tracking would be of utmost importance for a more efficient management of patients with obesity, T2D and CVD/CAD (Bernstein et al., 2010; Pallazola et al., 2019), when successfully coupled with an effective coaching to modulate it toward healthy food choices (Spanakis et al., 2017). The AI/ML approaches can be leveraged for such purposes (Verma et al., 2018).

Rigdon and Basu (2019) performed a retrospective study using AI/ML exploring whether considering randomly sampled sparse nutrition data could possibly improve CVD mortality risk prediction. They made use of NHANES interview data collected from 1999 to 2011 linked to the National Death Index (NDI) in the US, selecting 29,390 participants as their training set and further 12,600 participants as their test set. Similarly to Alaa et al. (2019), they aimed at testing whether AI/ML-based approaches vs. standard (Cox) models and considering additional predictor variables (dietary information) could possibly improve CVD mortality risk prediction. They applied two DT-based AI/ML approaches the Gradient Boosted Machines (GBM) (Chen et al., 2013) and RF (Ishwaran et al., 2008), tailored to the analyses of survival data to demonstrated that the inclusion of dietary information significantly improved risk prediction, as compared to the standard models and when including only the traditional risk factors. In particular, they found that a standard Cox model without dietary factors overestimated the CVD mortality risk nearly two-fold, whereas AI/ML models in combination with these additional data substantially improved their predictions (AUC~0.87 vs. ~0.93).

In addition to genetic and environmental/life-style factors, gut microbiota has emerged as a additional factor influencing the CAD risk (Aryal et al., 2020). Clearly, researchers have asked, whether gut microbiome profiling combined with AI/ML approaches could be used for improved CAD/CVD risk prediction. In the last 10 years, a number of studies have demonstrated that there is a possible relationship between the gut microbiome composition, such as changes in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Roseburia, or Escherichia spp. and the development of several diseases, including obesity (Turnbaugh et al., 2009; Maruvada et al., 2017; Miyamoto et al., 2019) hypertension (Karbach et al., 2016), and CVD (Karlsson et al., 2012; Koeth et al., 2013; Miele et al., 2015; Kelly et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2017; Ascher and Reinhardt, 2018).

However, although the approach of using gut microbiome in combination with AI/ML approaches for disease risk prediction is not novel, it has not been widely applied for CAD, yet (Aryal et al., 2020). Zhu et al. (2018) compared the composition of the gut microbiome between 70 CAD patients vs. 98 healthy controls and used RF to potentially differentiate these two groups of individuals, achieving and AUC of 0.67. In addition, the gut microbiome of CAD patients displayed decreased diversity and richness, with decreased abundances of Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, and Eubacterium rectale (the butyrate producers) and increased abundances of Escherichia-Shigella and Enterococcus. More recently, in order to test whether gut microbiome could be potentially used for diagnostic screening of CVD, Aryal et al. (2020) applied five different AI/ML approaches (RF, SVM, DT, Elastic-Net and Neural Networks) to the gut microbiome relative abundances of 478 CVD patients vs. 473 healthy controls, collected as part of the American Gut Project [https://microsetta.ucsd.edu/american-gut-project/] and profiled using fecal 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. However, when using 39 differential bacterial taxa as features, the best AUC this study could achieve was AUC~0.58 (with Neural Networks), followed by Elastic-Net (AUC~0.57), SVM (AUC~0.55) and DT (AUC~0.51). Interestingly, the performance of RF significantly improved (AUC~0.65) when trained with the top 500 high-variance OTU features, instead of taxonomic features, whereas the AUC of Neural Networks dropped (AUC~0.48). Furthermore, highly contributing OTU features (HCOFs) were selected based on their variable importance (0–100, where 0: no contribution to the model and 100: max contribution to the model) to further reduce the dimensionality of the OTU feature space. The top 100 HCOFs with the highest scores were selected for training the RF model. As a result, the RF models trained with the top 20 and top 25 HCOFs achieved further improved performance (AUC~0.70).

It can be assumed that particular diets, such as those high in fats and/or sugars might lead to variations in the gut microbiome composition and changes in its functional capacity that potentially might facilitate the development of diseases, including metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance and atherosclerosis/CVD (Sanchez-Rodriguez et al., 2020). Despite the close link between our diet and gut microbiome, the number of studies collecting and analyzing both types of data is sparse and either not considering the full spectrum of dietary factors (Lu et al., 2017) or not directly addressing the prediction of CVD/CAD risk (Zeevi et al., 2015; Venkataraman et al., 2016; Spector et al., 2019).

In the context of CVD/CAD risk prediction, most studies have focused on the circulating levels of the diet- and gut microbiota-dependent metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) (Trøseid et al., 2020). Lu et al. (2017) used RF and the gut microbiome data to predict changes of TMAO levels after choline intake, as a potential approach for screening population at high risk of CVD and identified the beta (inter-individual) diversity of the gut microbiome as a significant predictor (AUC of 0.86) of increased vs. decreased plasma TMAO level.

Timely and precise identification of people at high risk of CAD is of utmost importance for the development of personalized treatment strategies (Alaa et al., 2019; Westerlund et al., 2021), as such persons may need more aggressive health promotion strategies, especially the modifiable CAD risk factors could be effectively reduced or even eliminated in this way (Movsisyan et al., 2020). Although, numerous algorithms for CAD risk prediction have been developed over the years and several have also entered the clinical routine (FRS Wilson et al., 1998, SCORE Conroy et al., 2003), these are typically based on a limited number of traditional CAD risk factors (age, sex, diabetes, LDL and HDL cholesterol, smoking, systolic blood pressure) and are not suitable across all patient groups (Alaa et al., 2019) and do not take into account the fact that by modifying the person's environment/lifestyle the disease risk could be reduced over time (Westerlund et al., 2021).

In any case, the AI/ML tools will not be a replacement for the human experts, who are still an integral part of the knowledge discovery process, hence, managing huge amounts of health data will need to become an integral part of future medical, policy making and research activity, across sub-disciplines (Moreira et al., 2019).
