How the Gut Microbiome Links to Menopause and Obesity, with Possible Implications for Endometrial Cancer Development

Background: Interest is growing in the dynamic role of gut microbiome disturbances in human health and disease. No direct evidence is yet available to link gut microbiome dysbiosis to endometrial cancer. This review aims to understand any association between microbiome dysbiosis and important risk factors of endometrial cancer, high estrogen levels, postmenopause and obesity. Methods: A systematic search was performed with PubMed as primary database. Three separate searches were performed to identify all relevant studies. Results: Fifteen studies were identified as highly relevant and included in the review. Eight articles focused on the relationship with obesity and eight studies focused on the menopausal change or estrogen levels. Due to the heterogeneity in patient populations and outcome measures, no meta-analysis could be performed. Both the menopausal change and obesity were noted to enhance dysbiosis by reducing microbiome diversity and increasing the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Both also incurred estrobolome changes, leading to increased systemic estrogen levels, especially after menopause. Furthermore, microbiome dysbiosis was reported to be related to systemic inflammation through toll-like receptor signaling deficiencies and overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: This review highlights that the female gut microbiome is intrinsically linked to estrogen levels, menopausal state and systemic inflammation, which indicates gut microbiome dysbiosis as a potential hallmark for risk stratification for endometrial cancer. Studies are needed to further define the role the gut microbiome plays in women at risk for endometrial cancer.

Excess exposure to menopause, obesity and excess exposure to estrogen have long been recognized as risk factors important in endometrial cancer development; however, the exact mechanism and the molecular interplay of these components remain to be elucidated [1,2,3]. In addition, not all women with excess exposure to estrogen or obesity will suffer from endometrial cancer. This suggests that these factors induce varying effects on the endometrium or that they most likely do not explain the complete phenotype. A possible explanation for the observed discrepancy between known risk factors of endometrial cancer and varying outcomes may be the interference of the human microbiome [4,5]. Research on risk stratification for endometrial cancer development is important because incidence rates of endometrial cancer are still rising steadily and are predicted to continue to increase in the upcoming years [1].

In this review, we searched the current literature that investigated and possibly linked estrogen levels, menopausal status and/or obesity, to gut microbiome composition and function. By further unraveling the intricate relationship between these known risk factors for endometrial cancer and gut dysbiosis, we may be able to outline future research into the correlation between gut microbiome and endometrial cancer and identify possible targets in prevention and therapy for this disease.

A systematic review was carried out using PubMed as primary database to identify relevant literature. All searches were performed between May and July 2020 to identify articles studying the relationship between gut microbiota (dysbiosis) and endometrial cancer risk factors: estrogen, postmenopausal status and obesity. We performed 3 separate searches using the following combination of key words:

The reference lists of all selected studies were manually searched. No publication period restrictions were imposed; however, we limited our search to English literature only. Full details of the search strategy is provided in Supplemental File S1.

The direct search on endometrial cancer and gut microbiome confirmed that there is indeed no direct evidence available. For the other searches, we included all articles investigating the influence of estrogen, menopausal status and obesity on the gut microbiome. Both human and animal studies were included. Articles researching gut microbiota in research participants already receiving cancer treatment were excluded. We selected studies that included a control group to have comparative data, so that we can analyze the changes in microbiome due to estrogen/menopausal status or female obesity. Furthermore, we excluded literature that studied the possible influence of different diets on the gut microbiome and studies investigating other malignancies or gynecologic pathologies related to gut microbiome. Finally, we excluded studies when their results were not stratified for gender.

The studies were selected by two individual authors (M.P.H.S. and H.M.J.W.) by reviewing titles, abstracts and keywords for relevance to the different risk factors for developing endometrial cancer and the gut microbiome. After this first selection process, the full text of the selected articles was obtained to assess their definitive eligibility. Reference lists were scrutinized for further relevant literature. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion between these two authors. When available, estrogen levels, menopausal status, BMI, alpha diversity and Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio were extracted. Furthermore, first author, publication year, study design and sample size were extracted (Table 1 and Table 2).

We assessed the methodological quality of the included studies on the basis of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) methodology for the case control and cohort studies [30] (Supplemental File S2). To assess risk of bias for cross-sectional studies, the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS) methodology was applied, and last, for animal studies, the Systemic review center for laboratory animal experimentation (SYRCLE’s) tool for bias was used [31,32] (Supplemental File S2). For alpha diversity, we used the data that were calculated using Shannon-index or Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) [33]. The Shannon index is a pure diversity index. It measures how evenly the microbes are distributed in a sample. OTU is the amount of taxonomic units present and thus measures differences in units, e.g., diversity. A statistician was consulted for evaluating statistical heterogeneity and questioning possible statistical analysis.

We combined the results for the first and second search because the latter only generated duplicates from the second search. Thus, the second and third search combined provide a complete overview of studies focusing on the correlation between menopausal status and estrogen levels and gut microbiome. A total of 188 studies of possible interest were considered out of 286 hits screened on title, abstract and keywords. In total, 154 articles were discarded as they either did not discuss the topic of interest or did not have an appropriate control group. The articles that remained included after the first selection, 34 full text articles were further evaluated. A total of 26 articles were discarded based on the fact that these articles discussed microbiome in general, dietary interventions, or did not include healthy individuals. Eventually, 8 articles were included, presented in Table 1. Among these studies, 5 involved human patients, and 2 involved animals (rodents).

Using NOS and AXIS, the selected articles demonstrated fairly to good quality (Table 3). The animal studies were graded using SYRCLE’s risk of bias tool.

From the 8 included studies, 6 reported on the alfa diversity of gut microbiota from premenopausal women compared to postmenopausal women [34,35,36,37,38]. In all 6 studies, the Shannon index was used to calculate the alpha diversity. Three studies [35,37,39] demonstrated that alpha diversity was significantly lower in the postmenopause compared to the premenopausal state (p < 0.05), while 2 other studies did not find any differences in alpha diversity when postmenopausal patients were compared to the premenopausal patients [36,38].

Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are considered the most abundant phyla of the gut microbiome. Thus, differences in abundance of these phyla may seriously affect symbiosis and have consequences for gut microbiome functioning and, thereby, possibly play a role in the causation of certain related health conditions. Five studies reported on the presence of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes [35,36,37,39,40]. All noted a disturbance in this ratio comparing pre- and postmenopausal women or women with high and low estrogen levels, suggesting that this ratio may be contributing to maintaining homeostasis in estrogen metabolism, possibly providing a therapeutic target in estrogen-related diseases. Four studies found that in postmenopause, the relative abundance of Firmicutes increased, and the presence of Bacteroidetes decreased, resulting in a significantly higher Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. This suggests that menopausal changes may induce gut dysbiosis, leading to a higher risk to develop health-related problems [35,38,39,40]. On the contrary, a recent study from Zhao et al. demonstrated that the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio decreased due to both a decrease in Firmicutes and an increase in Bacteroidetes [37]. Interestingly, the women included in this study were found to have the lowest BMI among all the study groups, which may have contributed to these conflicting results.

Phyla have several orders in their taxonomic rank that include many families, which again consist of different kinds of genera. All studies, except for one [37], found a higher abundance of most families and genera that belonged to the phyla Firmicutes in the postmenopausal group, also in line with the shift in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Moreover, those same studies showed less abundance of the families/genera in the phyla Bacteroidetes in the postmenopausal group. All changes in phyla, families and genera in postmenopause are visualized in Figure 1.

Within the Bacteroidetes phylum, one study showed a dominant presence in the gut microbiome of the families Bacteroidaceae (61.2%), Prevotellaceae (28.6%) and Rikenellaceae (3.6%) [35]. The same study also demonstrated that the relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae was higher in the premenopause, although in absolute numbers the Rikenellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and Odoribacteraceae families were more abundant in postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal women. The relative abundance of the genera Parabacteroides (p = 0.002), Prevotella (p < 0.001) and Bilophila (p not stated) were lower in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women [39]. In contrast, Zhao et al. found that the family Bacteroides had a higher abundance in postmenopausal compared to the premenopausal women in line with their reported ratio in Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio [37]. Moreover, the relatively new genus Alistipes was found to be lower in postmenopause. The animal studies reported that ovariectomized rats had a significantly lower abundance of the genera prevotella and Bacteroides compared to the non-ovariectomized rats [35,36,40].

Next, we looked into a possible connection between estrogen metabolism and the gut microbiome. Most studies (n = 6) reported about this relationship [35,37,38,39,40]. Postmenopausal women seem to have increased deconjugation of estrogens demonstrated by a significantly higher level of parent estrogens compared to estrogen metabolites (2-, 4- and 16-hydroxilated metabolites) in the urine of postmenopausal women compared to the urine of premenopausal women [34]. Fuhrman et al. also found that non-ovarian estrogens, for example, estrogens produced by cells of adipocyte tissue, were strongly inversely associated with fecal microbiome richness and alpha diversity [34]. This correlation between the levels of estrone and microbiome diversity may imply that more estrogens are excreted through feces when microbial diversity and enzymatic activity are low. Flores et al. demonstrated that in premenopause, estrogens were not associated with taxonomic relative abundance at the phylum level however strongly associated with each other in postmenopausal women [42]. Non-ovarian urine estrogen levels were strongly and significantly associated with Clostridia, the most abundant family in Firmuctes, non-Clostridiales and three genera in the family Ruminococcaceae (β = 0.57 to 0.70, p = 0.03 to 0.002) [42]. These associations were primarily driven by levels of the parent estrogen estrone and estrone metabolites, with estrone being the most abundant estrogen after menopause. No correlation was reported between total premenopausal estrogens and abundance of non-Clostridiales of the phylum Firmicutes [42].

Taking into account the growing evidence that oncogenesis in many cancers including endometrial cancers may be characterized by a pro-inflammatory state, levels of inflammatory cytokines related to the hormonal status in women are discussed although only reported in one study [39]. In this study, one observed higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP-1) plasma levels in healthy postmenopausal women compared to the premenopausal state (p = 0.036 and p = 0.045, respectively) [39]. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) increased in postmenopause, although this was not statistically significant.

For the third search, 602 articles were initially found. Most of these articles described either obesity in correlation with microbiota in conjunction with the risk of colon carcinoma, the effect of the gut microbiota after gastric bypass, or gut microbiota changes after introduction of specific food elements. These articles were excluded. Articles that did not differentiate between men and women were also excluded, since the aim of the search was to find differences in obesity and gut microbiota that could be relevant in the development of endometrial cancer, and sex-specific differences were thus deemed important. After screening all articles, the full texts of 56 articles were evaluated. Ultimately, only 8 articles were included that described the direct relationship between the gut microbiota and obesity in women only. These studies are described in Table 2. Table 2a includes 6 studies with women only and Table 2b describes 2 studies with sex-specific analyses.

Using the NOS the selected articles demonstrated fairly to high quality (Table 3). The included animal study was graded using SYRCLE’s risk of bias tool.

In most studies, the Shannon index or operational taxonomic unit (OTU) was similar between the groups of women with high BMI and women with low BMI. Menni et al. investigated effects on gut microbiome related to spontaneous differences in weight over a period of years and found a negative correlation between alfa diversity and increase in BMI [44]. Choi et al. found a lower alpha diversity in mice that were fed a diet high in fat, which was more pronounced in ovariectomized compared to non-ovariectomized mice [40]. When investigating fat distribution patterns, Min et al. (Table 2b) revealed a negative association between gynoid fat ratio (the amount of gynoid fat in relation to total fat distribution) and alpha diversity in all women [45].

Four studies reported about the specific phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and changes in their ratio to one another relative to differences in BMI [40,46,47,48]. They found that abundance of the phylum Firmicutes was increased in obese women and that abundance of the phylum Bacteroidetes was somewhat decreased in obesity, ultimately resulting in an increased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio in obese women [40,46,47,48]. The presence of metabolic syndrome showed a similar increase in this ratio [46]. Moreover, a large neck circumference, measured in this study as a proxy of fat distribution, led to an increase in Firmicutes, suggesting fat distribution along increased BMI is also relevant [47]. These observations again indicate that obesity is multifactorial and that also gut microbiome dysbiosis is linked to obesity. Moreover, Haro et al. demonstrated that the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio increased more in obese women compared to obese men, suggesting this link is sex-specific [49].

Overall, families and genera that belong to the phylum Firmicutes were more abundant in obesity, suggesting that specific shifts in bacteria occur in obesity (Figure 3). The genus Faecalibacterium from the phylum Firmicutes was found to be more frequently present in obese women and even more often in obese women with metabolic syndrome (p = 0.0003) [46]. In addition, 5 different OTUs from the phylum Firmicutes decreased in abundance when women lost weight. Three of these OTUs belonged to the family Lachnospiraceae [50]. Lastly, the genus Roseburia, which has been thought to be a biomarker in several metabolic diseases [51], is significantly more abundant in obese women. In contrast, only the family Ruminococcaceae, from the phylum Firmicutes, was found to be nominally protective against weight gain and obesity (OR 0.89, p = 0.38) [44,50]. Two studies containing premenopausal women and ovariectomized rats demonstrated a significant decrease in the genus Bacteroides in obesity [40,46], whereas one study that included perimenopausal women found an increased abundance of this genus [44] (Figure 3).

Lastly, Pekkala et al. found that obese women had a significantly higher toll like receptor 5 (TLR5) gene expression and more often had gut microbiota dysbiosis compared to their counterparts. Toll like receptor 5 is a protein encoded in TLR5 gene, present on flagellin bacteria in the gut microbiome. These findings suggest that TLR5 signaling may be a link between gut dysbiosis and obesity in women [48]. Miranda et al. presented data on the correlation between higher waist/hip circumference ratio and was related to a higher presence of the phylum firmicutes and obesity and inflammatory markers. Women with a high weight circumference (e.g., intra-abdominal fat and thus apple shape fat distribution) had increased systemic inflammatory markers, such as highly sensitive c-reactive protein (hsCRP), TNF-alpha and leptin. The effect size of leptin was high and from hsCRP and TNF-alpha moderate. However, no direct link between these markers and gut microbiome was presented.

This review focuses on the link between the gut microbiome composition and function, and the important risk factors for the development of endometrial cancer (menopausal/estrogen status and obesity in women). To date, there is no literature that investigates the direct influence of gut microbiome on endometrial cancer; however, this review shows that menopausal status and female obesity are correlated to gut microbiome dysbiosis, identifying possible targets for future research and a starting point for studies directly exploring the relation between endometrial cancer and the gut microbiome.

Lastly, it is becoming increasingly clear that gut microbiome is closely entangled with the immune system. Gut bacteria can create a state of chronic inflammation, which is associated with tumor development [74]. Gut bacteria can upregulate the Toll-like receptors (TLR) and activate the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB), which is important in inflammation regulation and associated with cancer. In fact, the activation of NF-kB leads to the release of IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, and IL-18 as well as the TNF-alpha, triggering chronic systemic inflammation [25]. Obese women have a significantly higher TLR5 gene expression and gut microbiome dysbiosis compared to their counterparts [48]. Pathogen-induced inflammation, however, is not limited to the site of infection as shown in a breast cancer model, where C57BL/6 ApcMin/+ mice do not develop breast tumors under specific pathogen-free conditions. However, on administration of oral Helicobacter hepaticus, they developed mammary carcinomas as a result of the innate immune induction through inflammation [75]. A state of chronic inflammation is also seen in obesity where the gut microbiota again seem to play a role, interacting with dietary lipids and creating inflammation in adipose tissue. Mice fed saturated fats had an increased activation of TLR, which was at least partially mediated by gut microbiota, leading to white adipose tissue inflammation [76]. Furthermore, estrogen also stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) [77]. The exact effect of the chronic inflammatory state through the interplay of the gut microbiome, estrogen metabolism and obesity in the development of endometrial cancer is unclear; however, the use of NSAID has been shown to decreases the risk of developing endometrial cancer in obese women, indicating a role in endometrial cancer development [78,79,80]. It is exciting to see that studies are underway investigating the effect of immunotherapy in high-grade obesity-driven endometrial cancer and the correlation between of the number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and microbiome profiles, both locally and in the gut (NCT03694834; clinicaltrial.gov (accessed on 29 June 2021)). Recently, in endometrial cancer, four molecular subgroups have been identified by the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and subsequently confirmed by other groups, POLE-mutated/ultramutated (POLE), microsatellite-instable/hypermutated (MSI), copy-number-low/p53-wild-type (p53wt) and copy-number-high/p53-mutated (p53mt), in addition to the histological subtype and grade [81,82]. It will be very relevant to study gut microbiome composition differences not only related to the histopathological variables but also against these molecular subgroups related to the different genetic markers.

As in any review, there are several some limitations and possible biases that need to be considered. Importantly, all evidence provided in this review concerns menopausal status and female obesity and how this is associated with changes in microbiome composition and function; any evidence towards endometrial cancer is therefore at most indirect. The microbiome is modulated by a wide range of external factors, which are not consequently measured or balanced for in the included studies, such as diet, geographic location and medication use. Moreover, the number of patients per study is considered small (n < 71). Thus, more than anything, this review is hypothesis generating rather than drawing definitive conclusions on the microbiome–endometrial cancer association. Finally, due to all the heterogenicity in the data, we were unable to perform a meta-analysis reducing the power of the conclusions.

Interest is growing in the dynamic role of microbiome disturbances in human health and disease. No direct evidence is yet available to link endometrial cancer to gut microbiome (dysbiosis). Nevertheless, this review has highlighted that the gut microbiome is intrinsically linked to estrogen metabolism, menopausal state and also systemic inflammation in women. Obesity and the menopausal change may lead to a shared dysbiosis, which can be recognized by a changed gut microbial diversity and Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, making them potential hallmarks for risk stratification in endometrial cancer and possibly other hormone-dependent and obesity-driven tumors. However, inter-individual variation is large and confounders including diet and environmental factors need to be accounted for. Future studies are needed to define any causative role the gut microbiome plays in women at risk for endometrial cancer, enabling us to find targetable factors to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer development.
