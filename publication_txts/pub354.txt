Impact of COVID-19 on the Intestinal Microbiome

This review article aims to explore the GI changes induced by SARS-CoV-2 and how gut microbial homeostasis can influence these changes and affect the lung-gut axis and its relationship with the induction of the cytokine release syndrome in severe COVID-19 patients.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects not only the respiratory system but can produce multi-systemic damage. The expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the high prevalence of GI symptoms in severely ill COVID-19 patients, and the abnormalities described in the gut microbiome in these patients have raised concerns about the influence of GI tract as a risk factor or as a potential modulator to reduce the severity of COVID-19.

Understanding the mechanisms by which gut dysbiosis may influence viral transmission and disease progression in COVID-19 may help in shaping how accessible therapies, like diet modulation, can potentially help beat the devastating consequences of COVID-19.

The new SARS-CoV-2 enters through and initially affects the respiratory system, but it can generate a multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are found to have worse coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1•, 2••, 3–5]. The role of the GI tract in modulating COVID-19 severity is being increasingly recognized [6]. SARS-CoV-2 may impede nutrient absorption by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme receptors 2 (ACE2), resulting in gastroenteritis-like symptoms, and predispose an imbalance in intestinal microbial homeostasis. Chronic low-grade systemic inflammatory conditions such as advancing age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity are associated with lower gut bacterial diversity and a disrupted gut barrier with increased permeability (leaky gut) which have been implicated in predisposing to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection [1•, 2••, 3–5, 7].

Understanding the mechanisms by which gut microbiome and dysbiosis may influence viral transmission and disease progression in COVID-19 may help to shape diet modulation therapies in high-risk populations and possibly reduce the devastating consequences of this pandemic. This review article aims to explore the GI changes and manifestations induced by SARS-CoV-2, its effect on gut microbiome homeostasis, and elucidate its possible effect on the lung-gut axis and its relationship with the induction of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

GI symptoms were underreported early in the pandemic. Huang et al. were some of the early authors to describe the SARS-CoV-2 clinical syndrome as fever, cough, and myalgias, with reported diarrhea in only one of 42 patients [11]. Other early studies out of Wuhan reported a 2–3% incidence of GI symptoms [12]. Abdominal pain and discomfort were reported with a range of 2.2–5.8% [13]. A recent meta-analysis reported a 15% pool prevalence of GI manifestations which were associated with a poor clinical course (Table
1) [14••]. This is in contrast with the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV where nearly 20–25% of patients reported diarrhea or other GI complaints such as nausea or vomiting. With progression of pandemic, the prevalence of diarrhea may have been even underreported. Liang et al. argue that since there is no uniform criteria for diarrhea many hospitals or clinicians may fail to report this symptom [12].

While SARS-CoV-2 is widely seen through the GI tract, it has been difficult to directly blame the GI symptoms on SARS-CoV-2 itself. The clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are likely multifactorial in nature and the summation of viral effects via the ACE2 receptor interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein creating increased inflammation, the effects of SARS-CoV-2 pharmacotherapy therapy, or from the stress of critical illness.

The gut microbiome is an intricate array of thousands of species varying depending upon an individual’s environmental and genetic make-up. There is a complex interplay between the gut microbiome and an individual’s health, as demonstrated by studies showing associations with allergy, inflammatory conditions, and respiratory diseases [20, 21] As previously described, individuals suffering from COVID-19 have several GI symptoms. Beyond those symptoms, they also have demonstrated changes in their microbiome which have broad implications in both diagnosis and treatment.

Given the impact of the microbiome on bacterial and viral replication, maintenance of this barrier is essential. Patients with COVID-19 infection have a decrease in beneficial bacteria and an increase in opportunistic bacteria which may be a combination of pathogenicity of the virus and host susceptibility due to chronic illness or obesity. This represents a potential area of treatment, as we have seen with the use of probiotics and fecal transplantation in other infectious diseases. While theoretically implicated, the true importance of the microbiome has not been fully elucidated. Further studies regarding composition, alteration, and therapies to restore the microbiome are needed.

Up to one fifth of patients with COVID-19 present with life-threatening complications, including ARDS and MODS [8]. Mentioned risk factors for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection include old age, obesity, and comorbid chronic conditions [1•, 2••, 33]. In these susceptible populations, COVID-19 can cause an overwhelming immune response which is termed as “cytokine storm syndrome (CRS)” [33–35]. Similarly, a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MISC) resembling Kawasaki disease has been noted [33, 36, 37]. Aimed at the process of virus elimination and containment, this amplified immune cascade activation with hyperinflammation is characterized by a dysregulated robust secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, IFN-γ) and acute phase reactants that trigger systemic inflammation, hypercoagulation leading to ARDS and MODS [7, 34, 37–39].

The exact relationship between gut dysbiosis and systemic inflammation in CRS remains elusive; various studies have explored the possible mechanisms [43]. Decreased gut butyrate may predispose to increased binding to ACE2 with subsequent activation leading to activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which may predispose to systemic vasoconstriction and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [1•, 44, 45]. Additionally, butyrate also increases mucin production via goblet cells and activates regulatory T cells, which play a vital role in attenuating cytokine production via minimizing T cell activation [43]. Gut dysbiosis and epithelial damage increase the expression of ACE2, increasing the SARS-CoV-2 replication in the gut and predisposing to further dissemination [6]. An imbalance in Ang II/Ang 1–7 ratio, with attenuated ACE2 protective mechanism, favors Ang II-AT1R signaling, which leads to subsequent RAS-dependent proinflammatory, prothrombotic, and vasoconstrictive events [35, 46]. Furthermore, intestinal ACE2 shedding may also predispose to gut dysbiosis [46]. The hyper-inflammation also could be contributed by the loss of modulation by Ang1-7 via Mas receptors which are normally involved in the attenuation of inflammatory response [35, 46]. ACE2 is essential for the expression of BoAT1 (sodium-dependent amino acid transporter) in the intestinal epithelium, and ACE2 blockade could result in a decrease in the intestinal uptake of tryptophan, which regulates the secretion of antimicrobial peptides via the mTOR pathway, predisposing to gut dysbiosis [45, 47].

Gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 are associated with intestinal epithelial damage, impaired intestinal barrier integrity, and the altered gut microbiome [48]. This impairment can stimulate the innate and adaptive immune responses and trigger an imbalanced proinflammatory cytokines response, well described in severe cases of COVID-19. In normal individuals, immune gut homeostasis is regulated by the fine balance between pro-inflammatory pathways involving Th17 T cells and regulatory T cells, efficiently balanced by the commensal microorganisms [48]. Gut barrier disruption alters the T and B cell balance and activates the enteric inflammatory response, which signals to the circulatory system and other organs, including the lung and brain, triggering an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure described in severe COVID-19 cases. These data reveal the association between the lung-gut-brain axis and microbiome disruption and suggest the GI tract is an important extrapulmonary site for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

A study of 15 patients with COVID-19 described how the altered fecal microbiome of these patients was enriched by opportunistic pathogens and depleted of beneficial commensals, and its association with the fecal presence of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity [25]. New research is focusing on understanding the lung-gut axis interaction and altering the intestinal microbiota to reduce disease severity.

Probiotics have been extensively studied in medicine over the past century [51]. There is evidence from both animal and human studies supporting antiviral and anti-inflammatory benefits, along with a connection between the “gut-lung axis” [20]. Antiviral activity is multifaceted through both direct probiotic-virus interaction intra-luminally, and stimulation of the immune system [52]. Multiple strains of LAB have been shown to reduce severity, duration, and viral titers of several viruses including cytomegalovirus, Ebola virus, and respiratory syncytial virus [53]. The anti-inflammatory properties have been demonstrated in both animal and human models through a reduction in IL-6 and TNF-a, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and an increase in IL-10, an anti-inflammatory marker, with administration of probiotics [53].

The limited studies available on COVID-19 patients indicate intestinal dysbiosis [52]. A small report from the beginning of the pandemic indicated low levels of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacerium in COVID-19 patients (Rajput et al., 2020). Zuo et al. has shown through fecal samples almost half of patients sampled showed stool positivity for COVID-19 viral RNA which persisted long after respiratory clearance. Additionally, the authors found that patients with viral RNA had higher levels of opportunistic pathogens [25]. Several studies are currently underway to better elucidate the role of probiotics in the treatment of COVID-19. Further evidence is needed for a definitive recommendation regarding probiotics and the treatment of COVID-19, although there is biological plausibility and reasons for hope that they may play a beneficial role.

The clinical consequences of COVID-19 are devastating, and the GI tract role is largely underestimated. The importance of gut homeostasis and appropriate immune response toward viral infections has gained momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the evidence of the types of susceptible populations. Gut microbiome composition changes has been linked to preexisting conditions associated with severe COVID-19 infection with high morbidity and mortality like old age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Restoring gut homeostasis with dietary modification or microorganism supplements is a potential therapeutic target to mitigate deleterious effects in the lung-gut axis, and severe systemic inflammation and intestinal damage.
