Food-grade cationic antimicrobial ε-polylysine transiently alters the gut microbial community and predicted metagenome function in CD-1 mice



Diet is an important factor influencing the composition and function of the gut microbiome, but the effect of antimicrobial agents present within foods is currently not understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of the food-grade cationic antimicrobial ε-polylysine on the gut microbiome structure and predicted metagenomic function in a mouse model. The relative abundances of predominant phyla and genera, as well as the overall community structure, were perturbed in response to the incorporation of dietary ε-polylysine. Unexpectedly, this modification to the gut microbiome was experienced transiently and resolved to the initial basal composition at the final sampling point. In addition, a differential non-random assembly was observed in the microbiomes characterized from male and female co-housed animals, although their perturbation trajectories in response to diet remain consistent. In conclusion, antimicrobial ε-polylysine incorporated into food systems transiently alters gut microbial communities in mice, as well as their predicted function. This indicates a dynamic but resilient microbiome that adapts to microbial-active dietary components.

It is estimated that the mucosal surfaces of the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) are colonized by a total of 1013–1014 microorganisms that assemble into communities.1 As such, these microbial communities are diverse in form and function and often contribute to host homeostatic operations. Host–microbial interactions impact local anatomic sites along the GIT,2–5 as well as distal locales to participate in host energy balance and metabolism.6–9 In addition, there is emerging evidence that the gut microbiome participates in neurodevelopment and cognitive processes.10–12 Accordingly, there are several external factors that may alter the community structural trajectory and function in specific instances. These extrinsic antecedents or perturbations may be specific to host developmental stage13–15 and include alterations to diet or other lifestyle elements,16–19 microbiome-active xenobiotics, such as antibiotics,20–22 host genotype interactions with cultural traditions,13 and exposure to allochthonous microbiota and environmental chemicals.18, 23 Among these factors, dietary interventions are a viable strategy to maintain, restore, or enhance gut microbiota function depending on the desired outcome.16–19 In a particularly illustrative example of linking diet with the microbiome, European children that ingest a modern western diet (i.e. 51.8% carbohydrate, 32.8% fat, and 15.4% protein with high-saturated fat and refined carbohydrate and low fiber24) exhibit a significantly divergent microbial community from those living in rural Africa.18 Similar observations of gut communities and their response to diets rich in fat and refined carbohydrates with low fiber content has emerged as a prevailing principle of nutrition.18, 19

Both ε-polylysine and pectin evade digestion and absorption by the host during transit through the GIT.36, 37 Consequently, ε-polylysine or ε-polylysine–pectin complexes would be expected to reach the colon intact and thus available to interact with the gut microbial community. In this study, the antimicrobial food additive ε-polylysine was experimentally investigated to characterize potential perturbations to the gut microbiome. In addition, the impact of electrostatic complexation of ε-polylysine with the anionic pectin was studied as it is often delivered in this format.

40 female and 40 male 6-week old CD-1 mice were randomly divided into four groups and segregated by sex (i.e. 10 female and 10 male mice per group) and fed a 20% high-fat diet supplemented with (i) maltodextrin alone (MD) that served as the control, (ii) maltodextrin + ε-polylysine (PL), (iii) maltodextrin + pectin (P), and (iv) maltodextrin + ε-polylysine + pectin (PL-P). Previous studies showed that mice co-housed together exhibit similar gut microbial communities.38, 39 Thus, pooled fecal pellets from each cage were collected in 24-h metabolic cages and analyzed at three points: week 1 (baseline), week 5 (intermediate phase), and week 9 (final phase) (Fig. 1). Body weight and food consumption did not vary regardless of treatment group and across the entire experimental period.

In addition to dietary biopolymers influencing specific taxa, the structural composition of the community had discernable and non-random changes in aggregate. ANOSIM46 with 999 permutations was used to test significant differences between sample groups based on weighted UniFrac.41 As expected, maltodextrin did not significantly shift the murine gut microbial community fed this control in either female or male mice (Fig. 4a, ANOSIM with 999 permutations, p > 0.05). Accordingly, pectin (Fig. 4c, ANOSIM with 999 permutations, p > 0.05) and ε-polylysine–pectin complexes (Fig. 4d, ANOSIM with 999 permutations, p > 0.05) did not promote significant shifts within the community. This is in remarkable contrast to the gut microbiomes that were transiently altered by ε-polylysine alone. As observed with specific taxonomic groups at the phylum and genus levels, the community structure was perturbed at the 5-week point to be subsequently resolved at the final sampling time. This suggests that the population composition was corrected to its initial state through adaptation to the continuously fed biopolymer (Fig. 4b, ANOSIM with 999 permutations, p < 0.05). This was not observed in the ε-polylysine–pectin complex treated mice, indicative of a shielding interaction with the microbial community.

The metagenomic potential inherent to gut microbiomes were inferred by Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) based on 16S rRNA phylogenetic data. A total of 6,854,103,780 observations were predicted across 6909 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology groups (KO) within the 48 gut communities that were profiled by PICRUSt. The resultant data were categorized into 254 functional pathways encompassing all of the 48 communities.

Whereas the predicted metagenomes responded to dietary ε-polylysine, no significant differences were detected in the other three feeding groups. This includes mice-fed ε-polylysine complexed with pectin, providing further support for electrostatic shielding to mitigate the anti-microbial influence of the ε-polylysine. Pectin alone does not alter the community structure or predicted function.

Both male and female mice were observed to determine if biopolymer activity within the microbiome is sex-dependent. Accordingly, several bacterial taxa colonized male and female animals asymmetrically and in a non-random manner. This includes the phylum Verrucomicrobia found at higher concentrations in female mice than males in aggregate (female: 4.96% of 24 samples, male: 2.63% of 24 samples, p < 0.05, multi-way ANOVA) (Table S11). Much of this may be accounted for by differences in Akkermansia populations (female: 4.50%, male: 2.63% p < 0.05). In addition, female mice harbored significantly greater populations of bacterial genera Parabacteroides (female: 2.47%, male: 0.5%, p < 0.05) and Bilophila (female: 2.13%, male: 0.01%, p < 0.05). In contrast, male mice were colonized by greater concentrations of Odoribacter (female: 0%, male: 0.92%, p < 0.05), Turicibacter (female: 0.02%, male: 0.21%, p < 0.05), Clostridium (female: 0.01%, male: 0.10%, p < 0.05), and candidate genus rc4-4 (female: 0.16%, male: 2.46%, p < 0.05) (Table S12).

Interestingly, dietary biopolymers may alter the genus representation that is somewhat dependent on sex. The relative abundance of Parabacteroides (sex*treatment p < 0.05, multiway ANOVA), Clostridium (sex*treatment p < 0.05, multiway ANOVA), Coprococcus (sex*treatment, p < 0.05, multiway ANOVA), and Bilophila (sex*treatment p < 0.05, multiway ANOVA) exhibited modest dependence on host sex (Fig. S6). In female mice, the Coprococcus content was higher in the pectin group relative to the other three groups in female mice (MD: 0.69%, PL: 0.63%, P: 0.98%, PL+P: 0.65%, MD vs. P: p < 0.05, PL vs. P: p < 0.05, P vs. PL+P: p < 0.05). However, in male mice, Coprococcus OTUs of pectin group were decreased in the microbiomes compared to the other three groups (MD: 0.94%, PL: 0.77%, P: 0.45%, PL+P: 0.78%, MD vs. P: p < 0.05, PL vs. P: p < 0.05, P vs. PL+P: p < 0.05). Also, Bilophila was reduced in female mice-fed ε-polylysine relative to ε-polylysine–pectin complexed diet (MD: 0.51%, PL+P: 1.63%, p < 0.05), whereas the microbiome of male mice did not exhibit this sex-linked population flux. In addition, the interactions of sex, sampling points, and biopolymer influenced the observed relative abundance of the genus Turicibacter (p < 0.05), Clostridium (p < 0.05), Coprococcus (p < 0.05), and the candidate genus rc4-4 (p < 0.05).

It is widely recognized that dietary constituents often influence the composition and function of gut microbial communities.16–19 However, there is a critical scientific gap in understanding the potential interactions with additives that restrict microbial activity in foods. These substances are added to preserve food integrity during storage and are believed to be inert or benign with respect to toxicology to the consumer. In this study, we report the in vivo influence on the microbiome by a food grade antimicrobial ε-polylysine. Both ε-polylysine and pectin are not hydrolyzed or absorbed in the upper GIT,36, 37 thus have the opportunity to interact with resident microbial communities established along the full length of the GIT.

It is possible that cage effects influenced the composition of the microbiome. Mice were co-housed in four separate cages (two cages per sex). As mice are coprophagic it may contribute to the development of a common microbiome in cage mates.39 In order to minimize the potential for this confounder, we collected and analyzed pooled feces samples. Thus, compositional change in the microbial community is more likely due to dietary treatment.

In this study, we investigated the influence of the food-grade antimicrobial biopolymer ε-polylysine on the compositional stability of the murine microbiota. Bacterial phylogenetic diversity within fecal extracts were ascertained by high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and community function was predicted from relative abundances of taxa using PICRUSt. Our results indicate that dietary ε-polylysine transiently alters the gut microbiome prior to restoration of the initial microbial population structure at the conclusion of the feeding trial. This is indicative of a community adaptive response to ε-polylysine that our results demonstrate is active on the microbiome in vivo. This perturbation is mitigated when the cationic ε-polylysine is associated with the anionic polymer pectin to incisively link ε-polylysine physicochemical properties with function. Finally, the absolute population structure of these murine gut microbial communities was observed to be sex-dependent, but did not alter the response trajectory to the antimicrobial ε-polylysine.

The animal study was performed in accordance with the protocol approved by the University of Massachusetts, Amherst Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (#2014-0079). Forty female and 40 male 6-week old CD-1 mice (36–40 g male, 29–33 g female) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA). The animals were housed in specific pathogen free cages (5 animals/cage) in an air-conditioned room (temperature 23 ± 2 °C, 50 ± 10% humidity, 12-h light–dark cycle) with ad libitum access to water and food. The mice were fed a 20% lipid diet to mimic the typical western concentrations for 1-week acclimation.65 Subsequent to a 1-week acclimation period, 40 female and 40 male mice were randomly divided into four treatment groups and segregated by sex (10 female and 10 male mice per group). The four dietary treatments were: (1) maltodextrin alone (MD) that served as the control, (2) maltodextrin + ε-polylysine (PL), (3) maltodextrin + pectin (P), and (4) maltodextrin + ε-polylysine + pectin (PL-P). Maltodextrin with a dextrose equivalent of ~18 (Maltrin® M180) was provided by the Grain Processing Corporation (Muscatine, IA, USA). ε-Polylysine was purchased from Wilshire Technologies, Inc. (Princeton, NJ, USA). High-methoxyl pectin was donated by TIC Gums (White Marsh, MD, USA). The biopolymer solutions were converted into powders and incorporated into the 20% lipid mouse diet as described previously.27, 65 The amount of ε-polylysine incorporated was based on estimating a likely adult exposure level to ε-polylysine in beverages. The maximum concentration of ε-polylysine as a preservative is 0.025% w/w.66 The daily dosage (g/g body weight) of ε-polylysine that were fed to the mice was based on the average American body weight67 and on the average per capita annual consumption of soft drinks in the United States,68 which is estimated to be 1.4*10−6 g/g body weight. Previous studies have demonstrated that a mass ratio of 20:1 pectin-to-polylysine leads to electrostatic complexes that retain their antimicrobial efficacy while inhibiting precipitation.33–35 Therefore, the final concentration of biopolymers exposed to mice are: (1) MD, 1.4*10−5 g/g body weight, (2) MD, 1.4*10−5 g/g body weight, PL, 1.4*10−6 g/g body weight, (3) MD, 1.4*10−5 g/g body weight, P, 2.8*10−5 g/g body weight, and (4) MD, 1.4*10−5 g/g body weight, PL, 1.4*10−6 g/g body weight, P, 2.8*10−5 g/g body weight. The amount of powders incorporated into the mice diet were made weekly based on calculation of the exposure level, the moisture of the powder from the spray dryer, and the average mice body weight of previous week. Pooled fecal pellets from each cage were freshly collected in 24-h metabolic cages and analyzed by 16s rRNA gene sequencing for gut microbiome at three time points: week 1 (baseline), week 5 (middle phase), and week 9 (final phase) subsequent to collection and storage at −80 °C (Fig. 1).

Total DNA was extracted from fecal pellets with the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol with the addition of a bead-beating step (FastPrep-24TM 5G MP Biomedicals Inc., USA). The concentration and quality of the recovered DNA was estimated with a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). PCR was performed to amplify the 16S rRNA gene marker using primers that bound the V3 and V4 regions, which also incorporates the Illumina overhang adaptor. The primer set was developed by Illumina (FwOvAd_341F 5’TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTA TAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and

(ReOvAd_785R 5’GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTA CHVGGGTATCTAATCC).69 PCRs were performed in a 96-well format on a Veriti thermal cycler (Life technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using 2x KAPA HiFi Hotstart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystem, Wilmington, MA, USA). AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Danvers, MA, USA) were used to purify the V3/V4 fragment amplicon from free primers and other contaminants. A second PCR attached dual indices and Illumina sequencing adapters using the Nextera XT Index Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with an additional round of AMPure XP bead purification. PCR products were quantified with the Qubit dsDNA BR Assay (Life technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and amplicon quality verified by DNA analysis ScreenTape Assay on Tape Station 2200 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). PCR products were pooled in equimolar concentration and diluted to 4 nM and denatured immediately prior to sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq (pair-end; V3; 5% PhiX) (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).

Raw Illumina fastq files were quality filtered and analyzed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology (QIIME) software pipeline v1.9.1.70 Reads were truncated at any site containing more than three consecutive bases receiving a quality score <1e−5, and discarding reads containing one or more ambiguous base calls, as were truncated reads of <190 nt. OTUs were assigned in QIIME using UCLUST71 with a threshold of 97% pairwise identity. Open reference OTU picking was performed using a subset of the greengenes bacterial 16S rRNA database (13_8 release),40 filtered to remove incomplete and unannotated taxonomies. Bacterial OTUs were classified taxonomically using a QIIME-based wrapper of UCULUST, against the Greengenes 16S rRNA database using a 0.50 confidence threshold for taxonomic assignment. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were aligned using PyNAST72 against the greengenes core set filtered at 97% similarity with chimera sequences identified and removed using ChimeraSlayer73 with the resultant alignment yielding a phylogenetic tree using FastTree.74 OTUs representing less than 0.01% of the filtered read pool was removed to avoid inflated estimates of diversity,75 as were quality-filtered samples containing less than 10 sequences.

Metagenomic functional shifts in communities were predicted using PICRUSt. OTUs were first normalized by dividing each OTU by the predicted 16S copy number abundance and then aligned to the greengenes 16S rRNA database using a closed reference picking protocol within PICRUSt.76 Statistical tests were used to compare functional groups within the STAMP software environment, and Bonferroni correction was performed for multiple analyses.77 For all analyses, statistical significance was declared if the p-value < 0.05.
