Inhaled diesel exhaust particles result in microbiome-related systemic inflammation and altered cardiovascular disease biomarkers in C57Bl/6 male mice

The gut microbiota plays a vital role in host homeostasis and is associated with inflammation and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Exposure to particulate matter (PM) is a known mediator of inflammation and CVD and is reported to promote dysbiosis and decreased intestinal integrity. However, the role of inhaled traffic-generated PM on the gut microbiome and its corresponding systemic effects are not well-characterized. Thus, we investigated the hypothesis that exposure to inhaled diesel exhaust particles (DEP) alters the gut microbiome and promotes microbial-related inflammation and CVD biomarkers. 4–6-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice on either a low-fat (LF, 10% fat) or high-fat (HF, 45% fat) diet were exposed via oropharyngeal aspiration to 35 μg DEP suspended in 35 μl saline or saline only (CON) 2x/week for 30 days. To determine whether probiotics could prevent diet or DEP exposure mediated alterations in the gut microbiome or systemic outcomes, a subset of animals on the HF diet were treated orally with 0.3 g/day (~ 7.5 × 108 CFU/day) of Winclove Ecologic® Barrier probiotics throughout the study.

Our results show that inhaled DEP exposure alters gut microbial profiles, including reducing Actinobacteria and expanding Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria. We observed increased circulating LPS, altered circulating cytokines (IL-1α, IL-3, IL-13, IL-15, G-CSF, LIF, MIP-2, and TNF-α), and CVD biomarkers (siCAM, PAI-1, sP-Selectin, thrombomodulin, and PECAM) in DEP-exposed and/or HF diet mice. Furthermore, probiotics attenuated the observed reduction of Actinobacteria and expansion of Proteobacteria in DEP-exposed and HF-diet mice. Probiotics mitigated circulating cytokines (IL-3, IL-13, G-CSF, RANTES, and TNF- α) and CVD biomarkers (siCAM, PAI-1, sP-Selectin, thrombomodulin, and PECAM) in respect to DEP-exposure and/or HF diet.

Key findings of this study are that inhaled DEP exposure alters small intestinal microbial profiles that play a role in systemic inflammation and early CVD biomarkers. Probiotic treatment in this study was fundamental in understanding the role of inhaled DEP on the microbiome and related systemic inflammatory and CVD biomarkers.

The gut microbiota is a dynamic group of microorganisms that plays a pivotal role in the homeostasis of its host by providing nutrients, providing protection from infections, stimulating the immune system, and aiding in digestion, among others [1]. The microbial communities in the intestines are constantly adapting to environmental and dietary changes of the host [2]. Exposure to air pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM), has been shown to alter the gut microbiome composition, increase the risk of obesity, gastrointestinal disorders, inflammation, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and other chronic illnesses [3–9]. Early epidemiological studies have shown an increased incidence of hospitalization on days of high air pollution due to gastrointestinal distress, such as inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, and Chron’s disease [10–12]. Collectively, these correlations emphasize a need to investigate further and characterize the effects of PM on the gut microbiome. Several studies have identified the effects of ingested PM on the gut microbiome; however, relatively few studies have aimed to understand the effects of inhaled PM on the gut microbiome [13–15]. Recent studies have shown that inhaled ambient PM exposure resulted in dysbiosis in the gut and intestinal inflammation in mice [9, 10, 15]. Furthermore, we have previously reported that whole-body inhalational exposure to traffic-generated emissions and wood smoke resulted in alterations in the gut microbiome and increased intestinal permeability in ApoE−/− mice [16]. With a more recent exploration of inhaled PM on the microbiome, there is a need to understand further the mechanisms by which PM alters the microbiome and the resulting physiological effects.

We have previously reported alterations in microbial profiles and local inflammation in the lungs resulting from diesel PM exposure combined with a HF diet, which were mitigated through probiotic-treatment. While the effects of inhaled traffic-generated PM and HF diet on the gut and CVD have been explored, to our knowledge, there are no studies that investigate the effects on the gut microbiome and associated expression of CVD biomarkers that include probiotic treatment. Understanding the role of the gut microbiome in promoting systemic inflammation and CVD following PM exposure is vital in the future development and application of microbiome-related therapeutics and interventions in health. Considering this gap in knowledge, we investigated the hypothesis that exposure to inhaled diesel exhaust PM (DEP) results in alterations in gut microbiota profiles, systemic inflammation, and CVD risk, which is exacerbated by HF diet consumption in male C57Bl/6 mice. Furthermore, we investigated whether the observed exposure and diet-mediated outcomes could be mitigated through probiotic treatment.

To understand the effects of inhaled DEP on the gut microbial profiles, we determined the relative abundance of bacteria in the small intestine of male C57Bl/6 mice exposed to inhaled DEP or saline controls (CON) fed a low-fat (LF) or high-fat (HF) diet. Figure 1 shows the relative abundance and relative percentage out of 100% of the top eight (A) phyla or top twenty (B) genus present in the small intestine in these animals. Additional file 1: Table S1 shows the mean, standard deviation, and standard error of mean for each group at the phyla level. To represent the changes in microbial profiles in response to inhaled DEP exposure, we used the average relative abundance percentages at the phyla and genus level and calculated the percent change compared to saline-control in their respective LF and HF group (Fig. 2). DEP exposure in the LF diet animals resulted in a 20.96% increase in Firmicutes; however, DEP exposure in the HF diet animals resulted in a 10.70% decrease in the Firmicutes. We also observed a small reduction in Proteobacteria with DEP exposure in the LF animals; however, we observed an expansion of Proteobacteria by 41.9% in HF + DEP mice, compared to HF + CON. Within the Proteobacteria phyla, DEP exposure was associated with an increase in Pseudomonas, regardless of diet, compared to their respective controls. DEP exposure mediated a decrease in Escherichia by 23.43% in the LF diet animals; conversely, DEP exposure mediated an increase of Escherichia by 59.41% in HF diet animals, compared to their respective controls. We found an overall reduction in Actinobacteria and an overall increase in Verrucomicrobia in the small intestines of DEP-exposed mice. Additionally, we observed an increase in Bacteroidetes with exposure to DEP, which was further increased with consumption of a HF diet. Table
1 shows the percent change in relative abundance and difference in average percent relative abundance resulting from DEP exposure in both the LF and HF groups, compared to their respective controls, which is represented in Fig. 2. The genus has been categorized into its respective phyla.

We calculated the α-diversity of microbial profiles in the small intestine, as determined by richness (Chao1 and ACE) and diversity (Shannon, Evenness) (Fig. 3). We observed a decrease in richness and an increase in diversity with DEP exposure in the LF diet animals, compared to controls. However, there was a decrease in both richness and diversity with DEP exposure between HF diet animals, compared to controls. There were no statistical differences in α-diversity with exposure, diet, or interaction by ANOVA; however, there were observed statistical differences in β-diversity in microbial profiles within the small intestine between these four groups. Both weighted (Fig. 4A) and unweighted (Fig. 4B) PCoA plots show dispersing of the groups concerning diet, but not DEP exposure. An Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) showed UniFrac distances with significant differences for comparisons between all four groups (LF + CON:HF + CON:LF + DEP:HF + DEP) with p-value of < 0.001, between LF + CON and HF + CON groups with p-value of < 0.001, between LF + CON and HF + DEP groups with p-value of 0.005, between LF + DEP and HF + DEP groups with p-value of 0.002 (Table
2).

To determine if inhaled DEP exposure altered circulating LPS levels, we measured plasma LPS levels in our study animals. We observed a significant increase in LPS with DEP exposure and diet (Fig. 5). Compared to LF + CON, LPS was significantly increased in LF + DEP (p = 0.023), HF + CON (p < 0.001), and HF + DEP (p < 0.001) groups. Compared to LF + DEP, LPS was increased in HF + CON (p < 0.001) and HF + DEP (p < 0.001) groups. There was no observed increase in LPS for HF + DEP when compared to HF + CON (p < 0.5698) group. The respective F values for circulating LPS are as follows: exposure F = 4.56, diet F = 92.73, exposure X diet F = 1.7.

Interleukin (IL) cytokines are a large class of immunomodulatory proteins that mediate growth, differentiation, and activation of cells during immune responses [32, 42]. To determine the impact of inhaled DEP exposure ± a HF diet on systemic inflammation, we measured the concentration of ILs in the plasma. As shown in Fig. 6A, we observed a significant decrease in IL-1α with DEP exposure. Compared to their respective controls, DEP exposure is associated with a significant decrease in IL-1α in both the LF and HF groups (Fig. 6A; p = 0.001) and HF + DEP (p = 0.023) groups. The respective F values for IL-1α are as follows: exposure F = 18.57, diet F = 0.303, and exposure X diet F = 0.425. We also observed a DEP exposure mediated effect on IL-3 concentration; interestingly, we observed opposite responses in the LF and HF diet groups (Fig. 6B). Compared to LF + CON, there was a decrease in IL-3 for LF + DEP, though not statistical (p = 0.066); however, there was a significant increase in IL-3 for HF + DEP group compared to both LF + DEP (p = 0.004) and HF + CON (p = 0.018) groups. The respective F values for IL-3 are as follows: exposure F = 0.24, diet F = 1.91, and exposure X diet F = 15.31. For IL-13, we observe a significant increase in both the HF diet groups, regardless of DEP exposure (Fig. 6C). When compared to LF + CON, there is a significant increase in IL-13 for HF + CON (p = 0.034) and HF + DEP (p = 0.047) groups. The respective F values for IL-13 are as follows: exposure F = 0.207, diet F = 6.239, and exposure X diet F = 0.306. DEP-exposure mediated a significant increase in circulating IL-15 with exposure in the LF diet groups (Fig. 6D); however, there was no difference noted in either the HF + CON or HF + DEP animals. The respective F values for IL-15 are as follows: exposure F = 4.523, diet F = 0.077, and exposure X diet F = 3.129.

In addition to ILs, there are several cytokines involved in mediating immune response. To further understand the cytokine and chemokines response to DEP exposure ± a HF diet, we measured cytokines in the plasma. We observed a significant increase in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in LF + DEP animals, compared to LF + CON (Fig. 6E; p = 0.041). No alteration in the concentration of G-CSF was observed in the HF animals. The respective F values for G-CSF are as follows: exposure F = 5.065, diet F = 0.166, and exposure X diet F = 0.482. Diet-related changes for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were observed in the current study (Fig. 6F). Compared to LF + DEP, there is a significant decrease in LIF for HF + DEP (p = 0.026) and a notable decrease for HF + CON (p = 0.053). The respective F values for LIF are as follows: exposure F = 0.096, diet F = 6.04, and exposure X diet F = 1.986. Conversely, we observed an increase in macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-2) for the HF diet groups, compared to LF diet (Fig. 6G). When compared to LF + CON, there is a significant increase in MIP-2 concentration in the HF + CON (p = 0.022) and HF + DEP (p = 0.036) groups, but no statistical alterations were observed in the LF + DEP group (p = 0.090). The respective F values for MIP-2 are as follows: exposure F = 1.449, diet F = 4.374, and exposure X diet F = 1.943. There were no statistical alterations observed in systemic regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and presumably secreted (RANTES) across any of the diet or DEP exposure groups (Fig. 6H). However, there was a significant increase in systemic TNF-α with HF diet (F
ig. 6I). DEP exposure also mediated an increase in TNF-α in HF + CON when compared to LF CON and DEP groups (p = 0.021, p = 0.018, respectively). The respective F values for TNF-α are as follows: exposure F = 0.896, diet F = 6.831, and exposure x diet F = 1.151. We observed no statistical differences for interferon gamma (IFNγ), IL-1β, IL-2, IL-9, IL-12(p20), LPS-induced CXC (LIX), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), or monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG) (Additional file 2: Figure S1).

As systemic inflammation is associated with the pathogenesis of CVD, we next investigated whether inhaled DEP exposure altered CVD biomarkers in cardiac tissue. We observed alterations in sICAM concentration with both DEP exposure and HF diet (Fig. 7A). When compared to LF + CON, there was a significant decrease in sICAM concentration in HF + CON (p = 0.010) group. Additionally, there was a significant increase in sICAM concentration in HF + DEP (p = 0.039) compared to HF + CON group. The respective F values for sICAM are as follows: exposure F = 0.058, diet F = 2.800, and exposure x diet F = 5.459. We also observed alterations in PAI-1 with exposure in respect to diet (Fig. 7B). Compared to LF + CON, there was a significant decrease in PAI-1 in the LF + DEP group (p = 0.043). There was also an increase in PAI-1 in HF + DEP group when compared to LF + DEP group (p = 0.033). The respective F values for PAI-1 are as follows: exposure F = 1.72, diet F = 1.854, and exposure x diet F = 3.123. sP-selectin concentration was statistically increased with inhaled DEP exposure and HF diet (Fig. 7C). When compared to LF + DEP, we observed a significant increase in sP-selectin concentration in HF + DEP (p = 0.010) group. The respective F values for sP-Selectin are as follows: exposure F = 0.001, diet F = 2.205, and exposure x diet F = 6.040. We found a statistical decrease in thrombomodulin concentration with DEP exposure (Fig. 7D). When compared to LF + CON, we observed a significant decrease in thrombomodulin for LF + DEP (p = 0.043) and HF + DEP (p = 0.028) groups. However, there was no statistical difference in HF + DEP (p = 0.088) group when compared to HF + CON group. The respective F values for thrombomodulin are as follows: exposure F = 8.076, diet F = 0.328, and exposure x diet F = 0.073. Lastly, we observed an increase in PECAM with HF diet (Fig. 7E), but no alterations were observed with DEP exposure. The respective F values for PECAM are as follows: exposure F = 0.269, diet F = 6.316, and exposure x diet F = 0.013.

To determine if probiotic-treatment can mitigate DEP mediated alterations in gut microbiome profiles of mice on HF diet, we treated a subset of mice with 0.3 g/day (~ 7.5 × 108 cfu/day) of Ecologic® Barrier probiotics (PRO) in the drinking water throughout the exposures and determined the resulting microbial profiles. Figure 8 shows the relative abundance and percentage out of 100% of the top eight (A) phyla or top twenty (B) genus present in the small intestine of mice from each group. We found that probiotic treatment resulted in less change in Firmicutes with DEP exposure (Fig. 9). Probiotic treatment resulted in a 1.5% decrease in Firmicutes when comparing HF + DEP + PRO to HF + CON + PRO, which reduced the changes we observed between the HF + DEP and HF + CON groups by 9.2%. There was a 41.9% increase in the Proteobacteria in HF + DEP when compared to HF + CON. Alternatively, with probiotic treatment there was only a 0.85% increase in Proteobacteria in HF + DEP + PRO when compared to HF + CON + PRO. Thus, probiotic treatment attenuated the expansion of Proteobacteria in the gut of DEP-exposed animals on a HF diet. Within Proteobacteria, we found a 59.48% increase in Escherichia in HF + DEP when compared to HF + CON, however, that was reduced to only a 4.13% increase in Escherichia with probiotic treatment in HF + DEP + PRO when compared to HF + CON + PRO group. We also observed an 85.81% decrease in Actinobacteria and a 97.07% decrease in Bifidobacterium in HF + DEP compared to HF + CON. With probiotic treatment, we observed only an 8.9% decrease of Actinobacteria and a 2.2% decrease in Bifidobacterium in HF + DEP + PRO when compared to HF + CON + PRO. Thus, probiotic treatment diminished the overall reduction associated with DEP exposure of Actinobacteria by 79.61%. Additionally, we found an expansion of Verrucomicrobia with DEP exposure within probiotic-treated mice. Table
3 shows the percent change in relative abundance and difference in average percent relative abundance for HF + DEP to HF + CON and HF + DEP + PRO to HF + CON + PRO, which is represented in Fig. 9. The genera have been categorized into their respective phyla.

The α-diversity of microbial profiles in the small intestine was assessed by richness (Chao and ACE) and diversity (Shannon and Evenness) (Fig. 10). A decrease in diversity and richness were observed with DEP exposure between HF + CON and HF + DEP. Coversely, with probiotic treatment, we observe an increase in diversity and richness in both the HF + CON + PRO and HF + DEP + PRO groups. There were no statistical differences in alpha diversity with exposure, probiotic treatment, or interaction by ANOVA. However, there were statistical differences in β-diversity in microbial profiles within the small intestine between these four groups. Figure 11 shows the (A) weighted PCoA and (B) unweighted PCoA plots based on UniFrac distance using the fraction of total variance of bacteria represented by each axis with each dot representing one animal within each group. Both weighted and unweighted PCoA plots show dispersing of the groups with respect to probiotic treatment, but not DEP exposure. We performed Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) to assess the variations among different groups. AMOVA showed UniFrac distances with significant differences for comparisons between all four groups (HF + CON:HF + CON + PRO:HF + DEP:HF + DEP + PRO) with p-value of 0.002, between HF + CON and HF + CON + PRO groups with p-value of 0.001, between HF + CON and HF + DEP + PRO groups with p-value of 0.003, between HF + DEP and HF + DEP + PRO groups with p-value of 0.032 (Table
4).

We next quantified the probiotic strains to confirm their presence within the small intestine (Fig. 12). We observed significantly increased levels of bacterial strains present in the probiotics supplement in the small intestine of mice in the probiotic treatment group, compared to those in the control group. Figure 12B shows the individual strains’ presence in the small intestine for each of the four groups. Two Bifidobacterium lactis strains (W51 and W52) and two Lactococcus lactis strains (W19 and W58) were combined due to > 99% identity similarity between the two strains.

To determine whether probiotic-treatment attenuated either DEP or HF diet mediated increases in LPS, we assessed circulating LPS levels (Fig. 13). Probiotic-treatment significantly decreased circulating LPS in mice on a HF diet (p = 0.025) and those on a HF diet exposed to DEP (p = 0.026), compared to the HF + DEP group. The respective F values for circulating LPS are as follows: exposure F = 0.202, probiotics F = 8.769, and exposure x probiotics F = 0.171.

Probiotics have previously been shown to decrease ILs, both locally and systemically [37], thus we measured circulating IL concentrations in response to DEP exposure in HF diet mice ± probiotics (Fig. 14). We observed a significant decrease in IL-1α with exposure and probiotic treatment (Fig. 14A). Compared to HF + CON, there is a statistical decrease in IL-1α for HF + DEP (p = 0.014) and HF + DEP + PRO (p < 0.001) groups. Additionally, there was a statistical decrease in HF + DEP + PRO (p = 0.033) when compared to HF + CON + PRO. The respective F values for IL-1α are as follows: exposure F = 12.27, probiotics F = 4.548, and exposure x probiotics F = 0.112. Conversely, there was a statistical increase in IL-3 with DEP exposure and probiotics (Fig. 14B). When compared to HF + CON, there is a statistical increase in IL-3 in HF + DEP (p = 0.003). Compared to HF + DEP, there is a statistical decrease in IL-3 for both HF + CON + PRO (p = 0.009) and HF + DEP + PRO (p = 0.006) groups. The respective F values for IL-3 are as follows: exposure F = 3.984, probiotics F = 3.737, and exposure x probiotics F = 7.182. There was an overall reduction of IL-13 noted with probiotic treatment (Fig. 14C). When compared to HF + CON, there is a significant decrease in IL-13 for HF + CON + PRO (p = 0.018) and HF + DEP + PRO (p = 0.033) groups. Furthermore, compared to HF + DEP, there was a significant decrease in IL-13 for HF + CON + PRO (p = 0.024) and HF + DEP + PRO (p = 0.044) groups. The respective F values for IL-13 are as follows: exposure F = 0.024, probiotics F = 10.99, and exposure x treatment F = 0.063. We did not observe any statistical differences for IL-15 in the HF ± probiotics groups (Fig. 14D).

There were no statistical differences for IFNγ, IL-2, IL-9, IL-12(p20), LIX, MCP-1, M-CSF, and MIG observed across any of the DEP exposure or treatment groups (Additional file 3: Figure S2). We did note a statistical decrease in IL-1β when comparing HF + CON + PRO to HF + CON (p = 0.041) and HF + DEP (p = 0.005) using an unpaired t-test (Additional file 3: Figure S2); however, could not perform a two-way ANOVA due to the HF + DEP + PRO group IL-1β measurements being below the standard curve.

To determine whether probiotic treatment altered CVD biomarkers in our study animals, we analyzed cardiac tissue. Probiotic-treatment normalized increased sICAM levels observed in HF + DEP animals (Fig. 15A; p = 0.018). The respective F values for sICAM are as follows: exposure F = 0.078, probiotics F = 0.874, and exposure x probiotics F = 7.505. There were no statistical differences for PAI-1 observed across any groups (Fig. 15B). However, probiotic treatment resulted in altered circulating sP-selectin levels in both CON and DEP exposed animals (Fig. 15C). When compared to HF + CON, there is a significant increase in sP-selectin in HF + CON + PRO (p = 0.012). Furthermore, sP-selectin is decreased in HF + DEP + PRO (p = 0.002) compared to HF + CON + PRO. We do not observe the same trend when comparing HF + CON to HF + DEP (p = 0.233). Additionally, there are no differences noted between HF + DEP and HF + DEP + PRO groups (p = 0.085). The respective F values for sP-selectin are as follows: exposure F = 2.164, probiotics F = 0.780, and exposure x probiotics F = 10.96. We observed a significant decrease in thrombomodulin with probiotic treatment (Fig. 15D). When compared to HF + CON, there is a significant decrease in thrombomodulin with HF + DEP (p = 0.047), HF + CON + PRO (p = 0.018), and HF + DEP + PRO (p = 0.005). Additionally, there was no significant difference between HF + CON + PRO and HF + DEP + PRO (p = 0.675). The respective F values for thrombomodulin are as follows: exposure F = 3.214, probiotics F = 7.184, and exposure x probiotics F = 1.37. Lastly, probiotic treatment resulted in a significant decrease in circulating PeCAM (Fig. 15E). When compared to HF + CON, there is a significant decrease in PeCAM for HF + CON + PRO (p = 0.022) and HF + DEP + PRO (p = 0.005). Additionally, there was a significant decrease in PeCAM in HF + DEP + PRO (p = 0.014) when compared to HF + DEP. The respective F values for PeCAM are as follows: exposure F = 1.058, probiotics F = 13.63, and exposure x probiotics F = 0.004.

Studies have shown a correlation between exposure to inhaled environmental air pollutants and systemic inflammation, CVD, and alterations in the gut microbiome [6, 9, 16, 17]; HF diet is also a known contributing factor to these disease states [19, 43–45]. However, few studies have investigated how the gut microbial composition changes correspond with systemic inflammation and markers of CVD resulting from inhaled traffic-generated PM exposure coupled with a HF diet. There are three potential mechanisms through which inhaled air pollution can alter the gut microbiome: (1) through a direct effect, where inhaled PM can be trapped in the mucociliary tract and subsequently expelled and swallowed, (2) through an indirect effect, where PM is inhaled into the lungs and are absorbed across the respiratory membrane into the systemic circulation acting via the gut vasculature, or (3) through an indirect effect, where inhaled PM promotes lung microbial dysbiosis, oxidative stress, or and inflammatory signaling factors that can influence the gut microbiome via the circulation (Fig. 16). We have previously reported that inhaled DEP exposure from these same study animals resulted in a significant expansion of Proteobacteria within the lungs, associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, which was attenuated through probiotic treatment [46]. Considering the exacerbated responses to DEP exposure in the HF diet animals, we decided to use a probiotic treatment in this study group to determine if we could mitigate the exposure and diet-mediated alterations in microbiota profiles and systemic responses.

One goal of the current study was to determine if probiotic-treatment could prevent the DEP exposure ± HF diet mediated alterations in microbiota profiles and subsequent detrimental systemic and cardiac outcomes. Our results revealed that the microbiome plays a vital role in mediating these systemic inflammatory responses following a 30-day exposure/diet protocol. Previous ambient PM and vehicle exhaust exposure studies have described resulting alterations in the gut microbiome and systemic inflammation [9, 16]; however, the effects of traffic-generated PM, such as DEP, on these outcomes is not as well characterized. The dose of DEP used in the current study is higher than that typically experienced in an ambient environmental scenario, representing approximately 10 μg/mouse/day, which, when adjusted in mice, is estimated to be nearly 40-fold higher than alveolar deposition resulting from a 24 h inhalation exposure of 100 μg/m3 in humans [84]. However, we chose this dose based on previously characterized effects in the lung and cardiovascular system [84]. We also recognize that the DEP utilized for this study is not necessarily representative of all diesel engine-generated PM. Nevertheless, this study provides preliminary information on the outcomes of subacute DEP exposure and diet-mediated alterations on gut microbial profiles and associated systemic inflammatory signaling pathways.

Our findings demonstrate that inhaled DEP exposure alters the gut microbial profiles and diversity, increases systemic inflammatory response, and is implicated in the etiology of the early stages of CVD. The apparent reduction in Bifidobacterium and expansion of Akkermansia and Escherichia in the gut with HF diet and DEP exposure is of particular importance in further understanding of how air pollution influences gastrointestinal disease, as well as its implications in contributing to inflammation and CVD (Fig. 16). The use of probiotics in this study proved to be pivotal in understanding the influences that the microbiome has on systemic and CVD effects following DEP exposure ± HF diet. Thus, our current findings serve as a foundation for future studies to investigate the mechanisms involved in gut-heart axis signaling and provides insight into the potential therapeutic use of probiotics for microbiome manipulation and prevention or treatment of diseases associated with systemic inflammation, including CVD.

Four-to-six-week-old C57Bl/6 wild-type male mice (Taconic, C57BL/NTac) were fed ad libitum either a low-fat diet (LF) consisting of 10% fat and 17% sucrose (Research Diets #D124505H, n = 24) or a HF diet consisting of 45% fat and 17% sucrose (HF, Research Diets #D12451, n = 48) during the entire course of the study. Mice were co-housed 4 per standard shoebox cage with a barrier filter lid in a humidity and temperature-controlled environment on a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle. Animals were acclimated for 1 week, then placed on their respective controlled low-fat or high-fat diet and/or probiotic treatment 3 days prior to first exposure. Diet and probiotics were maintained throughout the course of the study. All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the University of North Texas IACUC and follow the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication No. 85-23, rev. 1996). The authors note that the animals in this exposure and probiotic treatment study are the same animals from Daniel et al. [46].

Mice were randomly assigned to be exposed via oropharyngeal aspiration (OA) to 35 μg diesel exhaust particles (DEP) purchased from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Standard reference material #2975) suspended in 35 μl 0.9% sterile saline (DEP, n = 36), or sterile saline only (CON, n = 24) twice a week for 4 weeks. The NIST DEP #2975 particle size was previously analyzed by Miller at el., which reported a mean DEP particle size of 257 ± 46 nm [84], and a mean diameter (volume distribution) of 31 ± 0.6 μm, as reported in the certificate analysis by NIST. DEP mixtures were suspended in saline and then sonicated for 5 min immediately prior to the start of dosing for each exposure day. Furthermore, the DEP suspension was vortexed for 1 min before each animal exposure to ensure homogeneity was maintained throughout the exposure period. All chemical constituents for the chosen DEP material is characterizied and ceritified by NIST. We previously reported the measured the levels of LPS within the DEP, which was determined to be negligible [46]. For OA, mice were anesthetized with 2% Isoflurane (Butler Schein Animal Health), then suspended on a surgery board (rodent intubation stand; Biolite RIS 100), at approximately 60° angle. The tongue was gently pulled to the side using forceps, suspended DEP or saline was administered into the distal portion of the oropharyngeal cavity while the nose was gently closed until the suspension was aspirated. Following aspiration, the mouse was removed from the surgery board, placed on a warming pad, and monitored until fully recovered from anesthesia. The rationale for choosing OA was two-fold: (1) OA exposure route simulates the route particulate matter would take from the oropharynx region into the lungs, including contact with the mucociliary escalator, which is likely an important source for ingested PM after inhalation exposure and effects on the gut and/or resulting microbial profiles, and (2) compared to whole chamber inhalation models, OA exposure limits the amount of particulate ingested during grooming and/or eating.

A subset of mice on the HF diet were dosed with 0.3 g/day of probiotic (~ 7.5 × 108 CFU/day) Ecologic® Barrier 849 (Winclove Probiotics) in drinking water (PRO, n = 12) throughout the exposure study. Probiotic formulation is a proprietary probiotic blend consisting of nine bacterial strains: Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, B. lactis W51, B. lactis W52, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, L. brevis W63, L. casei W56, L. salvarius W24, Lactococci lactis W19, and Lc. lacis W58 (‘‘Ecologic® Barrier”, Winclove Probiotics B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in a carrier matrix of maize starch, maltodextrin, and minerals. Probiotics were provided in low-drip water bottles and measured daily to determine the average consumption of probiotics per cage. Probiotics were changed daily between 4 and 6 pm in cleaned bottles. Table

Mice were anesthetized with Euthasol and euthanized by exsanguination via cardiac puncture within 24 h of the final DEP exposure. Blood was collected in heparinized tubes and centrifuged at 4 °C at 15,000 g for 10 min. Supernatant plasma was collected and stored at − 80 °C. The whole heart was removed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at − 80 °C for further analysis. The stomach, small intestine, and cecum were immediately excised and weighed. Small intestinal luminal contents were flushed with sterile PBS, collected, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at − 80 °C. The small intestine was dissected into three portions: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, which were snap-frozen then stored in − 80 °C for later analysis. Plasma samples were treated HemogloBind (Biotech Support Group LLC, East Brunswick, NJ #HO145), which is a bead-based product that removes hemoglobin without interacting with proteins or biomarkers. HemogloBind was added to plasma samples (1:1 ratio), vortexed for 30 s, inverted for 10 min, and centrifuged for 2 min at 9000 RPMs. The supernatant was removed using wide-bored pipette tips and stored at − 80 °C for downstream analysis.

Bacterial DNA isolation was performed on combined small intestine tissue and luminal contents using ZR Fecal DNA miniprep (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) following the manufacturers protocol. Two-centimeter portions of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were excised, combined with luminal content pellet (following centrifugation at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C), then homogenized using bead beater. DNA quantification and quality checks were performed using Shimadzu BioSpec-nano (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan).

Following DNA extraction, qPCR, and quality checks, samples were submitted to Salient Genomics (Krum, TX) for 16S rRNA gene V4 region sequencing using Illumina MiSeq 2 platform. Samples were prepared and amplified using the Illumina 16S rRNA gene metagenomic library prep guide (Illumina, #15044223 Rev. B). Samples were amplified by PCR and PCR product was cleaned using AmPure XP paramagnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). A second round of PCR to label sample DNA fragments with indices was done using TruSeq UDI kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with 10 base pairs each. Second PCR product was cleaned using AmPure XP paramagnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). Concentrations were determined for each sample using Qubit HS DNA assay (cat.# Q32851, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) on Qubit Fluorometer (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) and the length of samples was verified using the Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA assay (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Samples were then diluted and run on Illumina MiSeq 2 benchtop platform. Secondary analysis was performed using MiSeq Reporter software and fastq files were generated for downstream analysis.

16S rRNA gene sequencing reads (in fastq format) were analyzed using methods previously established by our lab [85]. Downstream statistical analysis of the data was performed to determine alpha diversity analysis (diversity within the sample) by generating the plots for Chao 1 and ACE index (for species richness), Shannon index (for species diversity), and evenness index (for species evenness). Beta diversity (diversity between the samples) analysis was performed by generating Unifrac weighted and unweighted principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plots (Lozupone and Knight 2005). Note that the samples that could skew the alpha–beta diversity analysis because of their sequence counts were removed from the downstream analysis. The diversity analysis was performed using phyloseq package in the R environment [86]. The statistical significance of these outcomes, including the diversity estimation, was inferred using AMOVA and ANOVA in Mothur [87].

Amplicon sequence data files were fastq formatted and the taxonomic classification of sequences was performed using the Illumina-curated version of Greengenes database and the 16S rRNA gene Metagenomics application within Illumina BaseSpace (version 1.0.1). Default parameters were used. To determine relative abundance, the upper 8 most abundant phyla and upper 20 most abundant genera were used when comparing LF + CON:LF + DEP:HF + CON:HF + DEP and HF + CON:HF + DEP:HF + CON + PRO:HF + DEP + PRO. Each sample’s OTU counts were normalized by total OTU counts for each phylum and genus. Outliers were removed using ROUT (Q = 1%). Relative abundance was determined by fraction of total for the eight most abundant phyla and twenty most abundant genera in GraphPad Prism 9. To represent changes with DEP exposure, we determined the percent change between DEP exposed and their respective controls (Figs. 1,
8). Relative abundance and percent change are determined using two different analyses, where LF + CON, LF + DEP, HF + CON, and HF + DEP uses the most abundant phyla and genera within the four groups and where HF + CON, HF + DEP, HF + CON + PRO, and HF + DEP + PRO use the most abundant phyla and genera within these four groups.

Paired-end reads were merged using PEAR (https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt593). Sequencing analysis was conducted using the VSEARCH open-source pipeline (https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.2584). Raw sequence data was filtered, dereplicated and screened at default parameters. The sequences were then clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 99% similarity identity. To determine the presence of probiotics in the sample, the V4 regions 16S rRNA gene bacterial samples were aligned as queries via global alignment in VSEARCH against a database constructed of the 16S rRNA gene sequences for the probiotics used in the study. The relative abundance of each probiotic was determined by dividing the total count for each given probiotic by the total number of screened reads for each sample. The probiotic strains Bifidobacteria lactis W52 and W51 have a 99.8% similarity within the V4 region and Lactococcus lactis W19 and W58 have 100% similarity within the V4 region, therefore we were unable to differentiate these individual strains in the samples. These strains were grouped for analysis purposes to give 7 bacterial strains for probiotics quantification.

Circulating LPS levels were measured in plasma using Pierce Chromogenic endotoxin Quant Kit (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) with a 1:100 dilution in endotoxin-free water following the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were run in duplicate and values were determined by known standard curve. Results are expressed as EU/mL. n = 5–6 samples per group for analysis. Samples measured out of standard curve were removed from the analysis.

To determine systemic inflammation, plasma concentrations of G-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-9, IL-12(p20) IL-13, IL-15, LIF, LIX, MCP-1, M-CSF, MIG, MIP-2, RANTES, and TNF-α were measured using Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel (Milliplex, St. Louis, MO) following manufacturers protocol for plasma samples. Samples were not further diluted following pretreatment when HemogloBind (dilution factor following treatment of 1.75). Samples were run on Luminex FLEXMAP 3D® instrument system with xPONENT software (EMD Millipore; St. Louis, MO) following the manufacturer's recommendation. Median fluorescent intensity data was used to determine unknown concentrations in Milliplex Analyst Software (EMD Millipore, St. Louis, MO). Samples measuring outside of the standard curve were removed from the analysis (n = 3–6). For supplementary data n = 2–8 and groups with all measurements below the standard curve are represented as no data (ND).

For protein extraction of cardiac tissue, 20–40 mg of heart (atria and ventricles) tissue was placed in lysis buffer (0.01 g bovine serum albumin, 5 μl of Triton-X 100, 5 μl protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem, MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO, cat. #535140), and 990 μl PBS) and homogenized in bead beater for 15 min. Next, samples were incubated at 4 °C on a rocker for 15 min, then centrifuged at 15,000 RPM for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and frozen at − 20 °C. Samples were then filtered in 0.22 μm syringe-driven filter unit (Millipore, St. Louis, MO, cat. #SLGP033RS). Samples were checked for purity and protein quantification using Take3™ Micro-Volume Plate (BioTek, Winooski, VT) read on Epoch™ Microplate Spectrophotometer with Gen5 Software (BioTek, Winooski, VT).

To determine the presence of cardiovascular disease biomarkers in the heart, cardiac tissue protein concentrations of sICAM-1, PECAM-1, sP-selectin, PAI-1, and thrombomodulin were determined using Mouse CVD Magnetic Bead Panel 1 (Milliplex, St. Louis, MO) following manufacturers protocol for tissue culture supernatant. Tissue lysis buffer was used used for matrix solution for samples. Samples were run on Luminex FLEXMAP 3D® instrument system with xPONENT software (EMD Millipore; St. Louis, MO) following the manufacturer's recommendation. Median fluorescent intensity data was used to determine unknown concentrations in Milliplex Analyst Software (EMD Millipore, St. Louis, MO). Sample concentrations were normalized to total protein concentration prior to statistical analysis. n = 4–6. Samples were removed from analysis because of (1) red coloration of sample due to red blood cell lysis, or (2) sample biomarker concentrations were not within standard curve range or below the measurable threshold.

Where not otherwise indicated, data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Sidak-Holm multiple comparison all-pairwise test using GraphPad Prism 9. Two-way ANOVA was used to determine the relationship between two independent factors—diet and exposure to inhaled DEP and the interaction between diet and exposure. For the probiotic studies, since all animals were on a high fat diet, a two-way ANOVA was used to determine the statistical relationship between the two factors of exposure and probiotic treatment, as well as the interaction between exposure and probiotic treatment. The Results section shows the corresponding p values and F values for each pairwise interaction. Outliers were determined and removed using ROUT method with a Q value of 1% in GraphPad Prism 9. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM and a p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Special notations have been made for data with p < 0.06 and p < 0.07 within the Results sections and figures.
