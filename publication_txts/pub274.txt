Gut Microbiome and Metabolites in Patients with NAFLD and after Bariatric Surgery: A Comprehensive Review

The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing, as are other manifestations of metabolic syndrome such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. NAFLD is currently the number one cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. The pathophysiology of NAFLD and disease progression is poorly understood. A potential contributing role for gut microbiome and metabolites in NAFLD is proposed. Currently, bariatric surgery is an effective therapy to prevent the progression of NAFLD and other manifestations of metabolic syndrome such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. This review provides an overview of gut microbiome composition and related metabolites in individuals with NAFLD and after bariatric surgery. Causality remains to be proven. Furthermore, the clinical effects of bariatric surgery on NAFLD are illustrated. Whether the gut microbiome and metabolites contribute to the metabolic improvement and improvement of NAFLD seen after bariatric surgery has not yet been proven. Future microbiome and metabolome research is necessary for elucidating the pathophysiology and underlying metabolic pathways and phenotypes and providing better methods for diagnostics, prognostics and surveillance to optimize clinical care.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, next to obesity, insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia. The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide, as is the prevalence of NAFLD [1]. The term NAFLD comprises a spectrum of liver diseases, ranging from hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with or without fibrosis [2]. Progression of NASH can ultimately lead to liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, NAFLD is considered to become the number one cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, with end-stage fatty liver disease as the second indication for liver transplantation [3,4,5].

In this review, we summarize the current evidence in humans on the changes in the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites after bariatric surgery, with a focus on the impact of gut microbiome and metabolites on NAFLD (Figure 1).

The microbiota consists of all host microorganisms, including bacteria, protozoa, viruses and bacteriophages. The genetic material of all microorganisms is called the microbiome. The microbiome can be differentiated by location, such as the gut microbiome, oral microbiome, dermal microbiome and vaginal microbiome [10].

The development of advanced sequencing techniques and the use of machine learning has increased the possibilities to gain insight in the human microbiome and derived metabolites and differences between specific populations, forming the foundation of a whole new scale of possible therapies [43,44,45]. The influence of the gut microbiome in diseases such as diabetes mellitus or inflammatory bowel disease has been intensely investigated [46,47]. Intervention studies with prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplantations (FMT) focus on elucidating a potential causal relationship between gut microbiome and development as therapy for various human diseases as well.

As briefly mentioned before, NAFLD includes various forms of fatty liver disease and can progress to severe and irreversible liver disease (Figure 1). Fatty liver disease encompasses hepatic steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFLD is defined as lipid droplet accumulation in more than 5% of hepatocytes, and is sometimes referred to “simple” steatosis [2]. NASH, characterized by inflammation, includes steatohepatitis with and without fibrosis and requires a liver biopsy for diagnosis. NASH is histologically characterized by inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning in combination with steatosis. Histological evaluation of liver biopsies is performed via scoring systems to classify liver disease, such as the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) and the Steatosis Activity and Fibrosis Score (SAF). Another frequently used score is the NASH Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) scoring system: F0 = no fibrosis; F1 = perisinusoidal or portal/periportal fibrosis; F2 = perisinusoidal and portal/periportal fibrosis; F3 = bridging fibrosis; and F4 = cirrhosis. European guidelines recommend the SAF score because of its higher accuracy in distinguishing the intermediate category from mild and severe fatty liver disease [48].

It is important to realize that although NAFLD is seen as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, not all patients with NAFLD are obese, and several patients with obesity do not have NAFLD either [49].

Differences in composition of the gut microbiome of patients with fatty liver disease have been observed (Table 1) [50,51]. Compared to individuals without NAFLD, fatty liver disease is associated with an increased abundance of Gram-negative microbiota: the abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria is increased [52,53]. The genera Escherichia, Enterobacteriaceae, Dorea and Peptinophilus are enriched, and abundances of Anaerosporobacter, Coprococcus, Eubacterium, and Faecalibacterium and Prevotella, Rikenellaceae and Ruminococcaceae are decreased compared to healthy controls [52,54,55,56]. Functional analyses of these microbiome differences reported increased microbial capacity for the metabolism of BCAAs and AAAs [52,54,55,56]. Furthermore, increased intestinal permeability, which is associated with dysbiosis, is seen in NAFLD [57]. Increased intestinal permeability and inflammation was observed in NAFLD patients in combination with dysbiosis of the gut microbiota: higher abundance of Escherichia was observed in fatty liver disease [58]. Development of fatty liver disease to NASH is associated with increased innate immune activation and inflammation [59,60]. The specific inflammatory factors associated with NAFLD are reviewed elsewhere [61].

As already mentioned, NAFLD can also develop in non-obese patients. Additionally, it appears that microbiome and metabolome signatures of non-obese patients with NAFLD differ from those of obese patients [67]; however, this requires further study.

The liver plays a central role in metabolism and homeostasis, and the majority of blood to it is supplied via the portal vein. The portal vein drains a large part of the gastrointestinal tract, and thus the liver is the first organ to process absorbed components, such as gut microbiome-derived metabolites.

Different patterns of bacterial taxa-metabolites networks are observed between non-obese NAFLD and obese NAFLD [67]. In non-obese patients with worsening fibrosis severity, stool metabolites cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), glycogenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) and glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) are increased. In obese individuals with significant fibrosis, LCA was significantly elevated. Of the three SCFAs, stool propionate levels gradually increased as fibrosis became more severe in non-obese patients [67].

Causality can be established with intervention studies. One of the first indicators for causality regarding gut microbiome and metabolic syndrome was when the transfer of intestinal microbiota of lean donors to patients with metabolic syndrome increased the insulin sensitivity [8,78,79]. Interestingly, metformin alters the gut microbiome of individuals with treatment-naive type 2 diabetes, probably contributing to the therapeutic effects of the drug [80]. However, most studies are cross-sectional and therefore cannot imply causality. A causal role for the gut microbiome and metabolites in the pathogenesis of NAFLD was indicated when donor feces of patients with hepatic steatosis induced steatosis after transplantation into germ-free mice. In addition, chronic treatment with phenylacetic acid also triggered steatosis [29]. FMT of human NAFLD gut microbiota into mice promoted the progression of NASH, by increasing the accumulation of intrahepatic B-cells, thus suggesting gut microbial-driven factors contributing to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis [81].

A recent publication studied the effect of FMT from vegan donors on histologic improvements of liver biopsies from patients with NAFLD. Although no significant histological changes were observed, positive changes in liver gene expression level were detected, as well as changes in metabolites and gut microbiome [82]. Another recently published study showed that donor FMT can improve liver stiffness in obese subjects [83]. Although promising, larger studies are needed to support these data.

Bariatric surgery is a successful therapy for obesity and related comorbidities, resulting in permanent weight loss and improvements of metabolic and inflammatory status, such as insulin resistance and fatty liver disease [86,87,88,89]. The most performed types of surgery are laparoscopic Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Other surgical interventions include omega-loop gastric bypass (OAGB), biliopancreatic diversion, adjustable gastric banding (AdGB) and vertical banded gastroplasty (VGB).

The gut microbiome of individuals with obesity differs from that of lean individuals [90]. The gut microbiome of obese patients has increased the capacity for energy harvest [91]. Bacterial diversity and gene richness are usually decreased in patients with obesity, and microbial gene richness is inversely correlated with the severity of obesity [7]. Moreover, a small but significant negative association between microbial species alpha diversity (the species variation at individual sample level) and BMI has been reported [90].

Multiple studies report changes in microbial composition after bariatric surgery. Different interventions showed different microbial profiles and only partial restoration towards lean microbiome composition. However, variations in results were observed, possibly due to different methods, small sample sizes, and/or comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes [106,107].

Plasma metabolites such as tyrosine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine and glutamate are all increased in patients with obesity [92]. Plasma glycine and glutamine levels are lower in obese patients [73]. Lower branched chain fatty acids (BCFAs) and higher BCAA levels are found in obese patients compared to controls [109]. Alterations of SCFA production are thought to play a contributing role in the development of obesity [20,110]. Colonic infusion with SCFA mixture increased fat oxidation and energy expenditure and decreased lipolysis in obese men [111]. Studies correlate metabolites with findings in the gut microbiome. For example, Liu et al. reported a decreased abundance of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a glutamate-fermenting commensal, in Chinese patients with obesity, and this decreased abundance was inversely correlated with serum glutamate concentration [92].

Finally, plasma bile acids are also altered after SG and RYGB [84,114]. Especially, after RYGB, the bilio-enteric flow is altered with changes in plasma bile acid concentrations and decreases in FGF-19 [114]. Changes in bile acid profile after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy are associated with improvements in metabolic profile and fatty liver disease (as measured via serum cytokeratin 18) [84]. A study analyzing the gut microbiome and serum bile acids of seven patients after RYGB with controls provided evidence for an increased abundance of microbial genes involved in converting primary to secondary bile acids [104].

NAFLD improves following bariatric surgery, both histologically and as measured with non-invasive methods such as laboratory results and transient elastography (Table 3). In a prospective study of patients after SG and RYGB, changes in non-invasive measures of NAFLD before surgery and 1 year after surgery were measured. Improvements in the laboratory-based fibrosis score ASAT/ALAT ratio (0.8 ± 0.3 vs. 1.1 ± 0.4), NAFLD fibrosis score (− 1.0 ± 1.8 vs. − 1.7 ± 1.3), APRI score (0.3 ± 0.2 vs. 0.3 ± 0.1), and BARD score (2.3 ± 1.2 vs. 2.8 ± 1.1) were seen [115]. Liver function tests in biopsy-proven NAFLD improved in 84% of patients after RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy [116]. Liver stiffness measured by transient elastography improved from before surgery to post-operation (12.9 ± 10.4 vs. 7.1 ± 3.7 kPa), and RYGB showed more improvements to liver stiffness than SG [115].

As mentioned before, overlap of differences in microbial composition exists between different metabolic diseases, including NAFLD and diabetes. To determine the exact isolated microbial effect of bariatric surgery on NAFLD, including its bacterial metabolites, more research is necessary in human studies with large sample sizes to find the subtle differences between the metabolic diseases. Additionally, it is expected that adding machine learning bioinformatics will further increase insights into genes and pathways involved in the improvement of NASH after RYGB [126].

Gut microbiome and plasma metabolite research is rapidly evolving, and heterogeneous new methods have been introduced. This certainly sometimes contributes to contradictory findings. Study population, chosen time points after intervention, differences in the handling of samples and storage also have an impact on study results. Validation and reproduction of results is necessary before findings can be declared as facts. Correct sample sizes with sufficient power can contribute to that. Furthermore, conflicting results and overlap of altered microbiota between metabolic diseases such as obesity, NAFLD, and type 2 diabetes are complicating factors in interpretation and in allocating findings to a distinct signature per disease: a recent review focused on microbial signatures of patients with NAFLD and the overlap with other metabolic disorders [54,67]. Thus, further research is necessary for validation and the continued comparing and interpreting of results.

Thus, the positive effects of bariatric surgery on NAFLD and its underlying mechanisms become more elucidated every year. Bioinformatics are used to exert insights into genes and pathways involved in the improvement of NASH after RYGB [46]. However, most patients with NAFLD will not undergo bariatric surgery. Therefore, expanding knowledge and the translation of gained insights is necessary to optimize general care. Although research can focus and reveal processes that cannot be seen by the human eye, we cannot escape the bigger picture of the impact of metabolic syndrome and NAFLD: there are limits to what health care can comprehend and support. The boundaries of resilience have become painfully clear during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic: simple steatosis is not as benign as assumed [143].
