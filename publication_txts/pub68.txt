The Athlete Gut Microbiome and its Relevance to Health and Performance: A Review

The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem of microorganisms that play an important role in human health, influencing functions such as vitamin uptake, digestion and immunomodulation. While research of the gut microbiome has expanded considerably over the past decade, some areas such as the relationship between exercise and the microbiome remain relatively under investigated. Despite this, multiple studies have shown a potential bidirectional relationship between exercise and the gut microbiome, with some studies demonstrating the possibility of influencing this relationship. This, in turn, could provide a useful route to influence athletic performance via microbiome manipulation, a valuable prospect for many elite athletes and their teams. The evidence supporting the potential benefits of pursuing this route and associated future perspectives are discussed in this review.



The gut microbiome consists of approximately 40 trillion microbial cells [1] and, thanks to insights provided by high throughput sequencing and culture independent technologies, there is now evidence to suggest that the human gut microbiome plays an important role in immunomodulation, digestion, vitamin metabolism, mood regulation, and a variety of other key functions [2–4]. The associated enhanced interest in the field has been reflected in a ten-fold increase in the number of manuscripts published on the human microbiome from 2010 to 2018 [5].

In recent years, interest in the importance of the gut microbiome in athletic performance has been slowly growing, with a significant number of studies being dedicated to investigating the potential ergogenic effects of the gut microbiome and microbiome-modifying treatments [10]. While currently, no clear recommendations exist surrounding microbiome-modifying treatments for athletes, it seems likely that there is a substantial amount of untapped potential with regard to the gut microbiome and athletic performance [11]. This potential, and quickly building interest, indicates that understanding and utilising the gut microbiome may become a vital part of sports nutrition in the future, and as such, the bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiome and athletic performance is the main focus of this review.

It has long been observed that exercise can have a profound effect on gut health, and indeed has been proposed as a treatment for a variety of chronic gastrointestinal diseases [12]. Exercise is believed to have a “J-curve” shaped, or hormetic, effect on gut health and immunity, with a moderate amount of exercise having a positive effect on addressing issues related to gut permeability and inflammation, while intense and sustained exercise can have a deleterious effect [13–15], evidenced by the fact that elite endurance athletes often complain of a variety of gastrointestinal disorders during or after exercise (Fig. 1). In one study, 96% of the participants in a 161 km ultramarathon experienced some form of gastrointestinal symptoms during the race (e.g., belching, nausea, vomiting), with 35.6% attributing their failure to finish the race to these symptoms [16]. On the other extreme of the spectrum, one study demonstrated that serum endotoxin levels were significantly higher in sedentary individuals with normal body composition compared to those of trained cyclists, supporting the theory that exercise has a hormetic effect on gut health [17]. The negative symptoms associated with strenuous exercise are believed to be primarily due to a redistribution of blood causing a lack of blood flow to the gut, known as intestinal ischaemia [18, 19], which in turn leads to increased gut inflammation and permeability [20]. Intestinal ischaemia, along with any reperfusion damage caused as blood flow is restored to the gut, may contribute to longer-lasting conditions such as gastritis or ulcers [21]. While intestinal ischaemia was previously thought to be largely the sole contributor to exercise-induced gastrointestinal issues, evidence of a role for the gut microbiome is accumulating. Indeed, in one instance it was shown that germ-free mice or mice treated with specific probiotics were resistant to gut ischaemia-related issues [22]. Probiotics are defined as “live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host” [23]. Additionally, various studies show that supplementation with particular strains of probiotics pre-race can have protective effects against gastrointestinal distress and upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in athletes, although the mechanisms are not yet fully understood [24–26].

A common problem affecting elite athletes, due to the aforementioned immunosuppressive effect of exercise at high intensity, is an increased incidence of URTIs that can have significant negative impacts on training and performance [27].

As such, these observations show that there is promise in employing specific probiotics to reduce URTI incidence and inflammation, minimising their impact on performance.

While the impact of the gut microbiome on inflammation is important to note, it must be considered that the interaction between exercise and the gut microbiome is not one directional. It has been well established that there are considerable differences in microbiome composition and diversity between athletes and sedentary individuals, with athletes tending to exhibit higher levels of alpha diversity and various health-associated microbiota [30]. Studies have noted that these differences may be both predictive and impacted by athletic performance, as discussed further in this section.

Taken together, these studies provide strong evidence that the gut microbiome influences multiple functions that are vital to athletic performance. Understanding and exploiting this bidirectional relationship may be a vital aspect of health nutrition in the future.

While understanding the complex interactions between the gut microbiome and athleticism is important, we must consider how we may leverage these understandings to improve current sports nutrition and modulate the gut microbiome in a favourable manner. An obvious pathway to this is through the use of microbiome-modifying substances such as pro-, pre- and synbiotics.

In combination, these investigations show that, while the associated mechanisms require further investigation, the microbiome-modifying effects of pro-/prebiotics could have a significant impact on the performance of athletes.

It is important to remember that the gut microbiome is a dynamic system that is often in flux, a consideration which should inform gut microbiome research and microbiome-modifying treatment use. As a result, single time-point microbiome profiling often fails to capture the intricacies of the gut microbiome as it changes over time. Longitudinal microbiome monitoring is the concept of using current microbiome profiling technologies to track the changes in an individual's microbiome over time, providing valuable insights on the effects of lifestyle changes on the microbiome and allowing more informed lifestyle choices.

Microbiome monitoring is especially important with regard to athletes, as extreme dietary and lifestyle changes between on and off season could have profound effects on the microbiome and, consequently, performance. By consistent monitoring of the microbiome, it is possible to detect deleterious microbiome shifts and address them before they become problematic, or to monitor an athlete’s gut microbiome response to an intervention. Previous studies have shown that the travel and dietary changes that often accompany the lifestyle of elite athletes can have long-lasting, negative impacts on the gut microbiome [89]. This could potentially be addressed using targeted pro-/prebiotic mixes designed to address any imbalances observed, although a significant amount of additional research is required to effectively develop these technologies and their integration.

An increasing body of evidence from human and animal studies suggests that exercise has a significant effect on the gut microbiome. This effect appears to generally be positive, increasing gut microbiome diversity and abundance of health-associated bacteria, with some studies suggesting that this is exercise-modality dependent. Developing a further understanding of this relationship and resulting applications would be highly beneficial to both athletes and scientists. In the future it may be possible to simulate the positive effects of long-term exercise on the microbiome using prebiotic, probiotic, diet or other interventions. However, to accomplish this a more granular elucidation of the complex relationship between athletic performance and the microbiome, and the underlying mechanisms, is required.
