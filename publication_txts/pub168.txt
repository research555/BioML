Gut microbiome and its role in colorectal cancer

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is still one of the most common types of cancer in the world, and the gut microbiome plays an important role in its development. The microbiome is involved in the carcinogenesis, formation and progression of CRC as well as its response to different systemic therapies. The composition of bacterial strains and the influence of geography, race, sex, and diet on the composition of the microbiome serve as important information for screening, early detection and prediction of the treatment outcome of CRC.

Microbiome modulation is one of the most prospective new strategies in medicine to improve the health of individuals. Therefore, future research and clinical trials on the gut microbiome in oncology as well as in the treatment of CRC patients are warranted to determine the efficacy of systemic treatments for CRC, minimize adverse effects and increase survival rates.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer with almost 2 million new cases per year, and it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide [1]. CRC is also one of the most common cancer types in Slovenia [2]. According to the Cancer Registry of Slovenia, there were 1321 new cases of CRC in 2017, of which 790 cases were men and 531 cases were women [2]. In Slovenia, the incidence of CRC has been declining in the last few years, mostly due to secondary preventive screening programs. Managing a patient with CRC, especially one with a metastatic disease, is complex and expensive, and it can result in a poor quality of life [3, 4]. Thus, primary prevention and screening programmes for CRC are crucial for contributing to a healthy society and for saving lives.

Only 10 to 15% of CRC cases are hereditary, which underlines an important role of the environment as a factor that genetically and epigenetically influences the development of CRC. In recent years, increasing importance in the development of CRC has also been attributed to the gut microbiome.

In recent years, the rise of CRC in those under 50 years of age, known as early-onset CRC (EOCRC), has become an increasing problem. EOCRC is epidemiologically, pathologically, anatomically, metabolically and biologically different from late-onset CRC (LOCRC). The incidence of EOCRC is estimated to increase by more than 140% by 2030 [5–9]. Anatomically, EOCRC is more frequent in the left colon and rectum than LOCRC. Family and hereditary conditions are a factor in 30% of EOCRC compared to approximately 15% in LOCRC. EOCRC also has a different signature than LOCRC as follows: approximately 60% of cases are microsatellite and chromosome stable: higher percentage of KRAS and tumour protein p53 (TP53) mutations; LINE-1 hypomethylation; and a lower percentage of BRAF and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations [5]. There is also a metabolic difference between EOCRC and LOCRC. Increased EOCRC incidence can be the consequence of the generational shift towards a higher body mass index and obesity caused by exposure to carcinogenic factors early in life, such as an interaction of the gut microbiome and inflammation, as well as other specific external factors, such as low-quality food and additive-laden food [5]. Obesity in early life, especially in connection with maternal obesity or obesity during infancy or childhood, can cause dysbiosis and inflammation, thereby leading to EOCRC [5]. Various external and internal factors are involved in this specific EOCRC [5] (Fig.
1).

General external factors are climate conditions, socioeconomic factors, education and stress. Specific external environmental factors are infections, radiation, alcohol, smoking, diet, physical activity, antibiotics and medications. Internal environmental factors are metabolic factors, the gut microbiome, oxidative stress, inflammation and hormones [5, 9–12]. One of the most important internal environmental factors is the gut microbiome. Under certain circumstances, exposure to an external environmental factor, such as stress or antibiotics, and synthetic food dyes or an internal factor, such as inflammation, leads to dysbiosis in the gut microbiome and consequently to CRC. For example, certain microbiota mediate the effects of a certain diet on CRC risk by generating butyrate, folate and biotin, which play a key role in the regulation of epithelial proliferation. CRC-associated microbiota also contributes to oncogenic epigenetic signatures [5, 13]. Stress, defined as an individual perception of psychosocial stress, is the most important general external factor contributing to the development of EOCRC, causing genetic, epigenetic and microbial changes in the individual as well as in the offspring of a stressed individual. Because psychosocial stress modulates microbiota signatures in gastrointestinal tumours (GITs), stress-induced dysbiosis and inflammatory load lead to the development of EOCRC [6]. Four main factors involved in dysbiosis of the microbiome and consequent development of CRC are the host and the host’s lifestyle, environment and gut microbiome (Fig.
2). One of the important issues in EOCRC is racial disparity. African Americans have a 20% higher incidence of CRC than Caucasians [13], and they are more likely to develop CRC at younger ages. The factors that have been linked with EOCRC, including obesity, physical inactivity, low socioeconomic status and unhealthy dietary patterns, are more prevalent in African Americans [14–16]. African Americans are also more likely to be diagnosed with CRC that originated in the right colon, and the reason for this racial difference is in the epigenome of the right colon relative to the left colon. Differences in the gut microbiome have been increasingly implicated in the rising incidence of EOCRC and may also contribute to higher CRC incidence in African Americans.

The human microbiota consists of a wide variety of microorganisms, bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa [13, 17–20]. The gut microbiome consists of microbial cells and their genetic material. The gastrointestinal tract inhabits a population of 1013 to 1014 different microorganisms and contains over 3 million genes, which is 150 times more genes than in the genome of a human body. The adult gut microbiome consists of more than 1000 different species and more than 7000 different strains of bacteria [21]. The microbiome is a part of each individual from birth when an infant gut is exposed to a complex microflora, which varies depending on the method of delivery. Because the microflora is important for the normal health of an individual, vaginal delivery is preferable as it exposes the infant’s gut to a complex microflora of a mother, resulting in a maternal signature in the initial microbiome of the infant [13, 20].

Because the aforementioned topics have been extensively reviewed in other papers, the focus of the present review is CRC, particularly the influence of microbiota on the development of CRC and the outcome of systemic therapy for CRC as well as potential modes of modulation of the microbiota for better treatment outcomes.

In the last few years, the role of the microbiome in the development of CRC has been increasingly emphasized [13, 19–21, 23–26]. It is well known that the gut microbiome has an important role in the carcinogenesis of CRC, causing initial inflammation and modulating different signalling pathways [13, 19–21, 23]. Because bacterial biomarkers have the potential to detect CRC and predict clinical outcome, they have prognostic value [13, 19, 25–28]. During the development of cancer, a complex interaction is established among the gut microbiome, tumour microbiome and immune system [18, 26]. The gut microbiome is in a state of health, known as eubiosis, when the following factors are present: diversity of bacteria in the gut microbiota; a balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines; a balance between immune cells and IgA secretion; and an intact and healthy mucosal barrier and mucus layer. In dysbiosis, these parameters are not in balance. Furthermore, the tumour microbiome has a negative impact on the gut microbiome, causing poor local and systemic responses of the host immune system as well as limited efficacy of systemic treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy [20, 25–29].

The CRC microbiota has a different composition of strains of bacteria than a healthy gut microbiome, and it includes strains individually linked to CRC, such as Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, as well as other newly found strains of bacteria connected to CRC, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas and Prevotella. Higher quantities of these bacterial strains in faecal and tumour samples from patients with CRC tumour microbiota can serve as CRC biomarkers [13, 20]. The gut microbiota influences colorectal carcinogenesis through a variety of mechanisms as follows: inflammation, regulation of immune response and modified metabolism of dietary components, which can also lead to the production of harmful microbial-derived products, such as metabolites or genotoxins [13, 17, 19, 25–28]. Bacteria can be directly procarcinogenic, known as driver bacteria, or indirectly procarcinogenic, known as passenger bacteria. The latter proliferate as opportunistic microorganisms in the tumour-associated microenvironment [13, 29]. Host–to-microorganism interactions contribute to the activation of procarcinogenic signalling pathways that lead to molecular changes and, consequently, to the progression of CRC. These mechanistic components have the potential to be modulated for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes in the context of CRC [13, 20, 21, 29].

Diet is also directly linked to obesity, which is a well-established risk factor for CRC. There are many mechanisms involved in obesity that can contribute to the development of CRC, such as insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1 signalling, adipokines, sex hormones and systemic inflammation [13, 20, 25–29]. The gut microbiota has an important role in these mechanisms because it can modify microorganism-derived proinflammatory molecules and oncometabolites. Obesity is also associated with reduced microbial diversity and changes in the composition of gut microbiota [13, 20, 29]. Diet-related obesity causes widespread histone methylation- and acetylation-activating signalling pathways, resembling those in carcinogenesis. Because of these links, weight control in individuals with obesity can profoundly change the gut microbiota and reduce the risk of cancer development [13, 20].

The gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as a predictive factor for the responses to systemic treatment of CRC patients. The gut microbiome is involved in the metabolism of chemotherapy and its pharmacokinetics as well as antitumour activity and regulation of toxicity. The gut microbiome mediates the response to chemotherapy, especially irinotecan, oxaliplatin and 5-flurouracil, which are prescribed as treatments for metastatic CRC [13, 25, 36–39]. The gut microbiome also mediates the immunomodulation response, regulates metabolism, mediates microbial translocation, reduces ecological diversity and establishes resistance to chemotherapy [13, 19, 25, 36–39]. The gut microbiome also plays a part in increasing the toxicity of chemotherapy, for example, by causing irinotecan-induced diarrhoea. SN-38, as an active metabolite of irinotecan, induces an increased abundance of gut bacteria, whose β glucuronidases can convert the SN-38-conjugated inactive form to the active metabolite, which causes diarrhoea [25, 26, 37]. In the human gut, β glucuronidase activity is present, especially in the Firmicutes phylum [35]. By selectively inhibiting this bacterial enzyme, irinotecan-induced diarrhoea could be prevented [13, 25].

One of the potential reasons for resistance to standard chemotherapy is cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are a subgroup of cancer cells responsible for chemoresistance and relapse of disease [40, 41]. CSCs are also known as tumour-initiating cells with the ability to self-renew and to differentiate into heterogeneous cancer cell lineages. Chemotherapy induces tumour heterogeneity of both cancer and normal cells inside the tumour. Despite reducing the bulk of cancer cells and inducing apoptosis, a subset of remaining CSCs can survive and differentiate into cancer cells with higher invasiveness, leading to relapse of disease and chemoresistance. CSCs can be recognized by specific markers of normal CSCs for different cancers, including CRC. Different mechanisms responsible for chemo resistance and cancer relapse have been identified, including epithelial mesenchymal transition, hypoxia, tumour environment, and resistance to DNA damage-induced cell death, cancer-associated fibroblasts, inflammation, immune cells, epigenetics, signalling pathways and others. Thus, CSCs are also involved or interfere with gut microbiota metabolism of chemotherapeutic drugs. Intestinal homeostasis of normal intestinal stem cells is influenced by the intestinal microbiota, but the exact mechanisms of interactions between the microbiota and reprogrammed CSCs in the development of CRC are not known [39]. Currently, investigations are focused on the role of specific microbes, which are involved in modification of the microenvironment and CSC transformation in CRC. Novel therapeutic approaches, including microbiota engineering, are under way to target the pathways to differentiate intestinal steam cells. New therapeutic strategies combining therapy targeting CSCs via their specific surface biomarkers and standard chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer patients in clinical trials are warranted.

The gut microbiome also plays an important role in the efficiency of immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors by enhancing the effect of immunotherapy [13, 17, 19, 42–44]. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is prescribed only for certain CRC subtypes, namely, for CRC with high microsatellite instability or for DNA mismatch repair-deficient metastatic CRC, which represents approximately 5% of metastatic CRC [45]. However, the gut microbiome can also be associated with the adverse effects of immunotherapy, especially with immune system-related colitis [45, 46]. The effect of the gut microbiome on immunotherapy depends on the strains of bacteria present in the gut. The relationship between the gut microbiome and the response to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has also been recognized in other types of cancer, such as melanoma, in which immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is well established [42, 43]. Gopalakrishnan et al. examined the oral and gut microbiomes of melanoma patients treated with immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors; more specifically, they examined taxonomic profiling, genomic profiling, metabolic function and the gut microenvironment [42]. Gopalakrishnan and colleagues found that responders to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy have a higher abundance of Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcaceae bacteria than nonresponders, and they reported that responders also have predominating anabolic functions compared to more catabolic functions in nonresponders as well as enhanced local and systemic responses of the host immune system compared to poorer immune responses of nonresponders [43]. As only 5% of CRC patients have microsatellite instability and are, therefore, candidates for immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors, we can extrapolate these findings from melanoma patients into the treatment of CRC patients. Prospective clinical trials, including studies on the relationship between the gut microbiome and immunotherapy in CRC patients, are warranted.

Prospective studies are bound to identify the exact mechanism of antibiotic-related effects on the immunotherapy response, which would enable the development of strategies for the safe prescription of antibiotics to immunotherapy-treated cancer patients.

The gut microbiome has many potential roles in dealing with CRC; for example, the gut microbiome may be a screening, prognostic and/or predictive biomarker, or it may be a modifiable factor influencing CRC prevention or CRC systemic treatment effectiveness [13, 25] (Fig.
4).

By modulating the gut microbiome, CRC can be prevented in high-risk populations, and responses to chemotherapy and immunotherapy can be improved. In addition, modulation of the gut microbiome can reduce the potential adverse effects of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Modulation of the gut microbiome can be achieved by dietary intervention, prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, antibiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) [13, 25] (Fig.
5).

The gut microbiome can be reshaped by dietary intervention. This includes an intake of prebiotics (such as dietary fibre), a low intake of fat, a plant-based diet, a low or no intake of red and processed meat or a higher intake of probiotics and postbiotics (such as microbial fermentation components, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These dietary requirements must be combined with weight reduction and exercise [13, 25].

Other novel approaches for modulation of the gut microbiome are being introduced as follows: bioengineering the gut microbiota; the synthesis and delivery of genetically engineered probiotics; and presenting bacteriocins or bacteriophages as modifiers of the gut microbiota [13, 25].

Predictive and prognostic biomarkers are important in personalized medicine of CRC patients. The gut microbiome is one of them because it can be involved in the carcinogenesis of CRC and can predict the prognosis and response of CRC patients to a specific systemic therapy. There are many interventional approaches to modulating gut microbiota, and many of which have previously been studied in clinical trials, including probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, FMT and lifestyle modifications, such as dietary modification and physical activity. Clinical trials have also investigated the modification of microbiota for detecting CRC or adenoma in asymptomatic individuals, improving immunotherapy or chemotherapy responses or reducing their adverse effects. Many questions remain unanswered about the appropriate delivery, kinetics efficiency and durability of modulation of the gut microbiome with prebiotics, probiotics and FMT. The methods of comparing and combining these treatment modes also remain to be studied. In today’s precision medicine, the key step will be the shift from an empirical approach of “one form of probiotic is suitable for everyone” to a personalized approach for each individual.

In the near future, the gut microbiome will have important clinical implications for CRC prevention, planning of systemic treatment and reduction of its adverse effects. The gut microbiome varies geographically, ethnically and according to the dietary habits and lifestyles of individuals. Clinical research will be needed in the near future to include influences on the microbiome of patients, such as geography, race, sex and diet, as well as how it is affected or altered by cancer systemic treatment, especially chemotherapy and immunotherapy. One of the most promising and challenging fields of research is the interaction of gut microbiota and CSCs in the development of CRC. In addition, the implementation of this knowledge and new therapeutic approaches in clinical research and everyday clinical practice will also be challenging. As each individual has a specific gut microbiome since birth, patient-tailored personalized medicine aided by artificial intelligence and machine learning is optimal to ensure better results. It is also important to emphasize that by promoting one’s healthy gut microbiome, the overall health of an individual is improved, which in turn beneficially impacts the public health of the whole society.
