Murine Genetic Background Overcomes Gut Microbiota Changes to Explain Metabolic Response to High-Fat Diet

Interactions of diet, gut microbiota, and host genetics play essential roles in the development of metabolic diseases. A/J and C57BL/6J (C57) are two mouse strains known to display different susceptibilities to metabolic disorders. In this context, we analyzed gut microbiota composition in A/J and C57 mice, and assessed its responses to high-fat diet (HFD) and antibiotic (AB) treatment. We also exchanged the gut microbiota between the two strains following AB treatment to evaluate its impact on the metabolism. We showed that A/J and C57 mice have different microbiome structure and composition at baseline. Moreover, A/J and C57 microbiomes responded differently to HFD and AB treatments. Exchange of the gut microbiota between the two strains was successful as recipients’ microbiota resembled donor-strain microbiota. Seven weeks after inoculation, the differences between recipients persisted and were still closer from the donor-strain microbiota. Despite effective microbiota transplants, the response to HFD was not markedly modified in C57 and A/J mice. Particularly, body weight gain and glucose intolerance in response to HFD remained different in the two mouse strains whatever the changes in microbiome composition. This indicated that genetic background has a much stronger impact on metabolic responses to HFD than gut microbiome composition.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common disease among chronic liver disorders in developed and developing countries [1]. NAFLD includes a clinicopathologic spectrum of diseases ranging from simple hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that may progress to cirrhosis and cirrhosis-related complications, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is also strongly correlated with obesity, insulin resistance (IR), and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of NAFLD, including NASH, is also rising in parallel with the increased frequency of obesity [2]. In the last decade, the role of the gut microbiome in obesity [3] and in NAFLD [4] has been revealed. There is also evidence that the gut microbiome plays a role as a link between genetic and phenotypic diversity among genetically different mouse strains in response to dietary challenges [5,6]. A high-fat diet (HFD) is generally applied to stimulate obesity and hepatic steatosis in experimental animals. However, results are variable in terms of weight gain, steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Indeed, the rodent strain, the fat amount in the diet, the nature of the fat, and the duration of treatment may affect the obtained results [7,8].

In addition to their effect on the host phenotype, HFDs have a remarkable influence on gut microbiota. In fact, a growing number of studies have reported HFD-induced alterations in gut microbiota in the obesity epidemic. HFD feedings have been related to alterations in the gut microbial structure and its decreased diversity [18,19]. There is also evidence showing that the gut microbiota is a signature of the metabolic phenotypes regardless of differences in diet and host genetic background [20]. In recent years, it has been shown that the gut microbiota in C57 mice determines the susceptibility to develop NAFLD [21], and that the gut microbiota contributes to the different susceptibility to fatty liver of the BALB/c and 129S6 mouse strains [22]. In this context, the goal of this study was to find out the contribution of genetics/microbiota on the metabolic response to HFD in susceptible (C57) and resistant (A/J) mouse strains, and the influence of genetics on microbiota alterations. For that purpose, we analyzed the gut microbiota composition in A/J and C57 mice, and assessed its responses to HFD and antibiotic treatments. Finally, we evaluated the possibility of exchanging the gut microbiota between the two strains to assess the contribution of the gut microbiota in the host response to HFD.

Procedures were performed according to the European Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the French Veterinary Authorities (authorization number 78-60). All conventional male A/J and C57 mice were purchased at 6 weeks of age from the Jackson Laboratory (Jackson laboratory via Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany). Upon arrival, mice were kept under a 12/12 h light/dark cycle for 1 week for acclimatization. Mice were identified by microchips injected under their skin. All mice were given autoclaved water and γ-irradiated (45 kGy) chow diet (R04-40, SAFE, Augy, France). For each experiment, 3 mice per cage were kept. All cages were kept in one room under the same conditions as mentioned above.

Body weight was monitored weekly. All mice were sacrificed immediately after the oral glucose tolerance test. Tissue and plasma samples were collected from the sacrificed mice and stored at −80 °C until analysis.

Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed at the end of the experiment for all mice. Mice were fasted for 8 h before a glucose solution (2 g/kg) was administered by oral gavage. Blood glucose at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min was analyzed from tail-vein blood using an Ascensia Elite XL glucometer (Bayer AG, Zurich, Switzerland). Areas under the glucose curve were calculated following the trapezoidal rule.

Extraction of total bacterial DNA from fecal pellets was performed using guanidium thiocyanate and the mechanical bead-beating disruption method as previously described [23]. The V3-4 region of the 16S rRNA genes was amplified using MolTaq (Molzym, Plaisir, France) and primers V3F: TACGGRAGGCAGCAG and V4R: ATCTTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCT. The purified amplicon was sequenced using Miseq sequencing technology (Illumina, Munich, Germany) at the GeT-PLaGe platform (Toulouse, France). Paired-end reads obtained from MiSeq sequencing were analyzed using the Galaxy-supported FROGS (Find, Rapidly, OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) with Galaxy Solution) pipeline [24]. For preprocessing, reads with length ≥ 380 bp were kept. Clustering and chimera removal steps followed the FROGS guidelines [24]. Assignation was performed using SILVA 16S. OTUs with abundances lower than 0.005% of the total read set were removed prior to analysis [25]. Then, 16S sequencing data were analyzed using the Phyloseq and ggplot2 R packages in addition to custom scripts. Samples were rarefied to even sampling depths before computing within-samples, also called alpha diversities, (observed richness and Shannon) and between-samples compositional diversities (Bray-Curtis). Principal Coordinate Analysis was also performed on Jaccard dissimilarities to obtain a 2D representation of the samples. Raw, unrarefied OTU counts were used to produce relative abundance graphs and to find taxa with significantly different abundances in A/J and C57 in the control group, or at different time points in the HFD and AB groups. A negative binomial model was fit to each OTU, using DESeq2 with default parameters to estimate abundance log-fold changes. OTUs with low total read counts (<50) or low prevalence (present in less than 25% of the samples, exact threshold specified in each analysis) were filtered out and p-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR).

For metabolic parameters, data are presented as mean values with their standard deviation (SD). Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Tukey’s multiple comparison tests were used to compare groups with different treatments. Differential abundance of bacteria was tested using negative binomial model implemented in DESeq2 and p-values corrected with False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure. Diversity indices (Chao1 and Shannon) were compared between groups and at different time points using two-way ANOVA. Other statistical analyses of microbiota data were described above. For statistical analysis, R 3.5 software using the package Bioconductor 3.8 and GraphPad Prism 6 were used.

At baseline, no differences were observed in body weight between the different groups of mice. C57 mice showed a significantly higher final weight compared to that ofA/J mice (Figure 2a). Accordingly, HFD feeding increased body weight gain about two-fold more in C57 than in A/J mice (Figure 2b) despite similar food intake. No differences in food intake between the different groups were observed (Supplementary Figure S1), indicating that, in our study, gut microbiota composition did not alter food intake. As expected, weight loss (1 g per mouse) was observed during the antibiotic-treatment week in all AB-treated groups in the two mice strains. AB treatment caused non-significant reduction in the weight gain of C57 mice compared to other treatment groups for this strain, but the final weight gain in A/J mice was not affected by AB treatments. FMT from either C57 or A/J strains increased weight gain in C57 mice compared to their C57-AB counterpart with no transplantation. By contrast, body weight gain in A/J mice was similar in all groups. Comparing the effect of treatment in both strains, only AB treatment was observed to affect body weight gain. Epididymal fat pads were heavier in C57 mice compared to those of A/J in all groups. Similar to body weight, epididymal fat pads tended to have lower weight in the AB group in C57, while no differences were observed between A/J groups. Liver triglyceride concentrations were found higher in C57 compared to A/J mice, but were similar in all groups of each mouse strain (Supplementary Figure S2).

Following HFD, C57 mice showed a higher level of glucose in their serum at different time points compared to A/J mice during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The area under the curve (AUC) was significantly higher in C57, mice indicating lower glucose tolerance. AB treatment tended to improve glucose tolerance in C57 mice but not in A/J. FMT from the same or opposite strains did not affect glucose tolerance in either strain, indicating that changing the microbiome does not impact differences in glucose tolerance due to the dominating effects of genetics in the two mice strains.

With the aim to define if different gut microbiota composition was responsible for the differences in HFD responses between the two mouse strains, we first analyzed the fecal microbiota of mice on a chow diet (T0). The Chao1 diversity index revealed that community richness was the same in C57 and A/J mice indicating a similar number of bacterial species in the two mice strains (Figure 3A). Conversely, the Shannon diversity index was lower in C57 than in A/J mice indicating a biased community structure with fewer dominant bacterial species in C57 (Figure 3A).

At baseline, 53 OTUs were significantly different between C57 and A/J mice, namely, 51 Firmicutes, one Bacteroidetes, and one Proteobacteria. At the family level, out of these 53 OTUs, there were 13 Ruminoccocaceae, one Alcaligenaceae, and one vadinBB60 group from Clostridiales, and the rest were from Lachnospiraceae (Figure 4). A total of 27 OTUs were more abundant in C57, and 26 OTUs in A/J mice.

We analyzed the gut microbiota composition at the three time points in mice from the HFD groups in the two mice strains. It was observed that microbiome richness in both C57 and A/J mice dropped significantly after HFD treatment, which occurred quickly in A/J mice and slowly in C57 mice, leading to a similar level of richness at the end but not the middle of the experiment (Figure 5A). The Shannon diversity index at T0 was higher in A/J compared to that of C57 mice, but decreased remarkably after HFD treatment. In contrast, the Shannon index for C57 mice increased after HFD treatment, suggesting that HFD led to more equal abundances of the bacterial species in C57 mice (Figure 5A).

In C57 mice, 39 OTUs (37 Firmicutes, one Actinobacteria and one Bacteroidetes) were significantly affected by HFD. Fourteen OTUs increased (belonging to Blautia, Peptostreptococaceae, Lactococcus, Ruminiclostridium, Peptoccocaceae, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group, Marvinbryantia, Ruminococcaceae, Oscillibacter, Lachnospiraceae) and 25 OTUs decreased (belonging to Lachnospiraceae, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Bacteroidales S24-7 group, Roseburia) (Figure 8).

We analyzed the gut microbiota composition at the three time points in mice from the AB groups in the two mice strains. As expected, bacteria richness dropped after AB treatment in both A/J and C57 strains. The Shannon diversity index was reduced in both mice strains after AB treatment, but C57 recovered quickly and returned to close to normal diversity (Figure 9A). Principal-coordinate analysis of the Jaccard distances showed that AB treatment quickly altered the intestinal microbiota of both strains (T4). In accordance to richness and diversity, microbiome profiles in C57 mice continued to change between T4 and Tf, while no further AB effect was noted in A/J mice after T4 (Figure 9B).

In A/J mice under AB treatment, 45 OTUs were significantly different between T0 and Tf. Interestingly, they all belonged to Firmicutes, with the exception of one Bacteroidetes OTU, including 26 Lachnospiraceae, 16 Ruminococcaceae, one Clostridiales vadinBB60 group, one Peptostreptococcaceae and one Bacteroidales S24-7 group. Only one Peptostreptococcaceae was significantly increased at T4 and Tf compared to T0, while all 44 other significantly different OTUs were decreased (Figure 10).

Finally, we analyzed the gut microbiota composition at the three time points in mice from the Same and Rev groups in the two mice strains. To compare changes in gut microbiota induced by FMT, we compared the differential OTUs obtained in strains transplanted from the same strain (A/J-Same, C57-Same) and opposite strains (A/J-Rev, C57-Rev). A/J-Same shared more OTUs with C57-Rev than with A/J-Rev, indicating effective transplant of A/J microbiota in C57 mice. Similarly, C57-Same shared more OTUs with A/J-Rev than with C57-Rev, indicating that C57 microbiota was adequately transplanted in A/J mice. However, our results clearly showed that not all bacterial species from one mouse strain were able to colonize the gut of the other mouse strain.

A/J-Rev also harbored Proteobacteria, which were lacking in A/J-Same mice. On the other hand, the C57-Rev group harbored a relatively lower level of Bacteroidetes and higher level of Firmicutes compared to C57-Same (Figure 13A). Consistently, the C57-Rev group showed similar pattern as the A/J-Same group with a relatively lower level of Bacteroidetes and a higher level of Firmicutes compared to C57-Same (Figure 13A). Before microbiota exchange, several bacterial families differed in proportion between C57 and A/J mouse microbiota (Supplementary Figure S4). Most of these families were effectively exchanged between the two mice strains following microbiota transplants. As an example, the Alcaligenaceae family was effectively transferred from C57 to A/J strain. Reciprocally, A/J-Same mice, which showed a very low level of Alcaligenaceae, could transfer this characteristic to the C57-Rev group (Figure 13B).

The microbiota starts to colonize the gastrointestinal tract just after birth. Then, its composition is impacted throughout life by host genetics and environmental factors including diet, antibiotics, and disease states [26,27]. Numerous studies have demonstrated a role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of many diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. How the gut microbiota modifies disease risk in each of these pathologies involves complex interactions with the host’s genetic background [6,28]. Furthermore, studies showed that different mouse strains, but also mice from different suppliers display distinct susceptibilities to obesity and diabetes when challenged with an HFD [28,29] highlighting the role of both genetics and environment in host metabolism. Moreover, the transplant of different microbiota to genetically identical mice can change their phenotype, including steatosis development [21]. Therefore, we can wonder if the gut microbiome of A/J and C57 mice contributes to their different responses to an HFD. To test this hypothesis, four groups of mice from each strain received an HFD for seven weeks. One group (HFD) received no other treatment, while the others received an AB treatment before HFD (AB), an AB treatment followed by a fecal microbiota transplant from the same (Same) or the other mouse strain (Rev).

FMT was previously shown to transfer a special phenotype from donor to recipient animal [21,56,57]. For instance, Bäckhed et al. induced for the first time weight gain and increased IR in germfree mice through fecal transplants from their conventional counterparts, despite a simultaneous decrease in food intake [56]. This was attributed to more effective calorie uptake due to carbohydrate processing by the microbiota. It was suggested that an altered gut microbial community, as a primary trigger, is causative rather than consequential by showing the transmissibility of the obese phenotype through fecal transplantation [57,58]. Therefore, exchanging the microbiome between diet-induced metabolic syndrome-susceptible and-resistant strains might change the phenotypes of the recipient mice and give insights into microbiota contribution in mouse physiology. In our study, the microbiome exchange did not markedly affect glucose tolerance in the recipient mice. Moreover, we did not observe a significant change in the weight of the A/J mice receiving a microbiome from C57 mouse and vice versa, compared with mice that received a microbiome from the same strain. This suggests that the genetic effect exceeds the potential influence of the microbiome, and that differences in gut microbiome composition are not responsible for differences in susceptibility to metabolic disorders between A/J and C57 mice. We may also speculate that, despite the success of microbiome transplantation as demonstrated by PCoA, important specific bacterial species from one mouse strain were not able to colonize the other mouse strain. This highlights the importance of recipient genetics on gut microbiota shaping, and may explain why microbiota exchange was not associated with changes in metabolic phenotypes in our study. This is an important point that may have clinical implications as FMT in humans are inevitably performed between subjects who are genetically different. Therefore, the inability of certain bacterial species to colonize the recipient subject may limit the efficacy of FMT if these bacteria are responsible for the beneficial health effects. This suggests that microbiota composition should be deeply analyzed in donor and recipient subjects to identify bacterial species associated with the efficacy or failure of FMT therapeutic effects. Future efforts testing the pathogenic or protective role of individual bacteria revealed here are warranted.

Here, we described the microbiome diversity and composition of two mice strains with different susceptibilities to metabolic disorders. We found that resistant A/J and susceptible C57 mice harbor distinct microbial communities highlighting the impact of host genetics on microbiota shaping. Moreover, we showed that HFD and antibiotic treatment differently altered the microbiota in the two mice strains, indicating that microbiota structure mainly results from genetic and environmental factors. Following antibiotic treatment, we were able to properly exchange the microbiome composition between the two strains indicating that the majority of the bacterial species from one mouse strain can colonize the other. This did not markedly affect the metabolic phenotype of the recipient mice, suggesting that the gut microbiome does not contribute to differences in metabolic phenotypes between these two mice strains. However, we cannot rule out that the most relevant bacterial species in terms of health effects were not properly transferred from one mouse strain to the other. This incomplete transfer of the gut microbiota should be taken into account when evaluating the efficacy of FMT in humans.
