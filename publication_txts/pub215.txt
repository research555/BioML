Altered gut microbiome compositions are associated with the severity of asthma

Despite substantial evidence on the contribution of the diversity of the gut microbiome to the pathogenesis of asthma and allergic diseases, little is known about their relationship with asthma severity and/or clinical phenotypes. We analyzed the difference in composition of the gut microbiome between subjects with asthma and healthy subjects and explored its role in the development of asthma.

Fecal samples from 15 subjects with severe asthma (SA), 14 with non-severe asthma (NSA), and 15 healthy subjects were assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing methods to identify the gut bacterial composition.

Compared with those in the NSA group, patients in the SA group had a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids, and there were more atopic subjects (60% vs. 35.7%, respectively). No significant differences were found at the phylum level either in operational taxonomic unit numbers or in diversity scores among the SA, NSA, and healthy groups. However, at the family level, the relative abundance of Acidaminococcaceae in the SA group was remarkedly lower than that in the group with healthy subjects (P<0.05). Furthermore, Veillonellaceae and Prevotellaceae were significantly more common in samples from the SA group than in those from the NSA group (P<0.05). In the SA group, positive correlations were observed between the relative abundance of Veillonellaceae and mid-expiratory flow 25% (MEF25%) predicted (r=0.538, P=0.047), as well as between the relative abundance of Acidaminococcaceae and body mass index (r=0642, P=0.010). Principal component analysis suggested that the relative abundances of Acidaminococcaceae and Prevotellaceae were associated with severe asthma. Moreover, we found that class Betaproteobacteria, order Burkholderiales, and family Alcaligenaceae were significantly different among the groups defined by serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels.

Our findings suggest that altered gut microbiome compositions are involved in the severity of asthma and that there are specific bacteria related to different asthma phenotypes in terms of serum IgE levels.

Asthma is a common respiratory disease, which is characterized by chronic inflammation. This condition affects approximately 1–18% of the population in different countries via both complicated etiopathogeneses and unknown pathogeneses (1). Recently, there has been a research focus on microbiota for its potential roles in patients with asthma. This study, as well as other studies, has shown the disordered lung microbiota and its contributions to the severity and phenotypes of asthma (2-7).

We present the following article in accordance with the STROBE Checklist (available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-2189).

In this study, 29 outpatients with physician-diagnosed asthma and 15 healthy subjects were recruited at The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University between December 2016 and June 2017. In patients with asthma 15 were classified as having SA and 14 were classified as having NSA. The proportions of smokers were similar in both the SA (1/15) and NSA (1/14) groups, and there were no smokers in the healthy group. The diagnoses and severities of asthma were confirmed based on the criteria of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) (1), while severe asthma was defined in accordance with the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) guidelines (24). We grouped these patients with asthma into the following two phenotypes on the basis of total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels: the high-IgE asthma (HEA; >60 IU/mL) group and the low IgE asthma (LEA; <60 IU/mL) group. The exclusion criteria considered for this study included the following: subjects diagnosed with other lung diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis and interstitial pneumonia), auto-immune diseases (inflammatory bowel disease), or other diseases known to affect the diagnosis of asthma. Patients taking antibiotics at the time of this study or those receiving immunosuppressive therapies and/or allergen-specific immunotherapies within the last year were also excluded from the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in 2013). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects and the research was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (approval No.2016-68).

Levels of specific IgE to common aeroallergens (Hx2 and Mx2) and the food allergen (Fx5) were determined using the ImmunoCAP system (Thermo Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden). Specific IgE was defined as positive if the measurement was ≥0.35 IU/mL. Subjects were characterized as atopic if they had at least one positive specific IgE.

Fresh fecal samples (1–2 g per person) were collected and transferred from bedpans that had been disinfected with 75% ethanol. The fecal samples were then manipulated and homogenized. The prepared samples were then collected and stored at −80 °C until further use (11).

The fecal samples (10–50 g) were collected with Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mMTris-HCl, 1 M EDTA, pH 8.0). Bacterial DNA was isolated and purified using a NEBnext microbiome DNA enrichment kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) in line with the manufacturer’s instructions. A standard concentration of 10 ng/mL of DNA was prepared for each individual sample for all PCR assays. After performing a sample quality test, we used those quantified DNA samples to construct a library. The bacterial DNA was amplified for the V4 hypervariable region of bacterial 16s rRNA. PCR was amplified with the fusion primer; then, short fragments were removed using Ampure beads. Finally, the quantified library was used for sequencing with the Illumina Miseq 2500 platform (BGI, Shenzhen, China).

Reads that did not match the barcode or the primer sequences were excluded before data analysis. Unique reads were pre-clustered by scripts written in Mothur (version 1.31.2, http://www.mothur.org/), within two mismatch similarities. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) numbers were assessed by scripts written in Mothur based on 97% similarities. First, unique reads were aligned to the Ribosome Database Project database using scripts of software written in Mothur and were subsequently annotated. Furthermore, when more than 51% of unique reads of the OTUs were interpreted to belong to one species, we defined these OTUs as representing a unique species. Then, OTUs were calculated by taxonomic analysis at a higher level, such as from the genus level, to the family level, and were summarized using Mothur software. To determine abundance information of the fecal samples, the numbers of reads in each OTU were computed. The distribution of all annotated species or OTUs at different taxonomic levels (i.e., phylum, class, order, family, and genus) among different samples was analyzed and summarized by scripts of software written in QIIME (version 1.50). We not only used the Chao1 estimator and ACE to estimate species richness but also used Shannon-Wiener and Simpson indices to assess the ecological diversity of various species. Differences in bacterial abundances and clinical parameters between healthy and asthmatic subjects were assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). We performed linear correlations to determine associations among clinical and demographical features and bacterial abundances in healthy subjects and patients with asthma. We selected 30 variables in cluster analysis; 22 variables were excluded as being clinically irrelevant for the clustering and being represented by other variables. Eventually, eight variables were selected. The SPSS statistical software package (version 18.0) was used for all statistical analyses. A P value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Data were reported as the mean ± standard deviation or median with interquartile range. Analysis of LSD, Bonferroni, and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used for parametric continuous data; analysis of Kruskal–Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, and Pearson’s correlation was used for nonparametric continuous data; and the chi-square test was used for categorical variables.

Sociodemographic and clinical features of the subjects are presented in Table 1. There were no significant differences in gender or body mass index (BMI) among the three groups: patients with SA, referred as the SA group, patients with NSA, referred as the NSA group, and the healthy subjects, referred as the healthy group, in this article. Compared with the healthy group, the SA and NSA groups showed higher eosinophils in both sputum and blood, suggestive of eosinophilic-predominant airway inflammation. Compared with the NSA group, the SA group had a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a higher percentage of atopy (60% vs. 35.7%, respectively; P<0.05).

We assessed bacterial richness by OTU numbers and evaluated species diversity by Chao, ACE, Shannon, and Simpson indices. In this study, a total of 3,274,052 raw reads were generated for all samples, of which 2,651,837 quality sequence reads were used for subsequent OTU analyses. We found no statistically significant differences among the three groups in the number of OTU, Chao, ACE, Shannon, or Simpson indices, indicating that gut microbial richness and diversity were quite equal among the three groups. We also identified 11 bacterial phyla in all of the fecal samples, of which Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Fusobacteria contributed to over 90% of the total sequences in all three groups (Figure 1). There was no significant difference in the relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum level among the three groups. However, at the family level, we confirmed that the relative abundance of Acidaminococcaceae was remarkably lower in the SA group, than that in the healthy subjects (P<0.05). Lachnospiraceae had a higher proportion in the NSA group than in the healthy group (P<0.05). Veillonellaceae and Prevotellaceae were observably more common in samples from the SA group than those from the NSA group (P<0.05) (Table 2 and Figure 2).

Analysis based on the family level showed that the relative abundance of Veillonellaceae was positively related to the proportion of sputum eosinophilia in the NSA group (r=0.579, P=0.030) (Figure 3A). In contrast, the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae was negatively correlated with sputum neutrophils (%) in the NSA group (r=−0.635, P=0.015) (Figure 3B). Additionally, positive associations were observed not only between the relative abundance of Veillonellaceae and MEF25% (Figure 3C), but also between that of Acidaminococcaceae and BMI (r=0.642, P=0.010) (Figure 3D) in the SA group.

In view of the potential role of total IgE levels in the gut microbiome profiles, we grouped our patients into the high-IgE asthma (HEA) group, low-IgE asthma (LEA) group, and healthy group. As shown in Table 3, there were 21 subjects (72.4% of all of the asthmatic patients) in the HEA group. Among them, 11 cases belonged to the SA group and 10 cases to the NSA group. Compared with the LEA group, acute attacks were obviously elevated in the HEA group. No statistical differences in OTU numbers, and Chao, ACE, Shannon, and Simpson indices were observed among the three groups. Similar to the SA and NSA groups, a core gut microbiome consisting of Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Fusobacteria at the phylum level was identified in the HEA and LEA groups (Figure 4). No significant differences in the relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum level were detected among the three groups. However, at the class level, Betaproteobacteria was more frequent in the LEA group than in the HEA group (P=0.018). Moreover, Burkholderiales was significantly more abundant in the LEA group than in the HEA group at the order level (P=0.018). Finally, Alcaligenaceae was confirmed to be more common in the LEA group than in the HEA group at the family level (P=0.019) (Table 4, Figure 5).

According to correlation analysis, nasal disease duration and serum total IgE showed a positive correlation between the three bacteria levels (Betaproteobacteria class, Burkholderiales order, and Alcaligenaceae family) in the HEA group (P<0.05) (Figure 6A I-VI). In contrast, significant negative correlations were found between the relative abundance of the abovementioned bacteria and the dose of oral steroids and sputum eosinophilia in the HEA group (Figure 6B I-VI). The relative abundance of Betaproteobacteria class, Burkholderiales order, and Alcaligenaceae family showed a positive relationship with the blood eosinophilic (%) (P<0.05) in the LEA group (Figure 6C I-III).

Five principal components (PC1-5) with eight values >0.8 and accounting for >10% of the variance were identified (Table 5). PC1 was characterized by severe asthma, which correlated with a worse reaction to ICS and an elevation of sputum neutrophils. Moreover, PC1 was associated with an increased abundance of Acidaminococcaceae. The features of PC2 included longer duration of asthma and nasosinusitis, without associated bacterial species. PC3, which had a lower abundance of Prevotellaceae, was also related to severe asthma. PC4 was grouped into non-severe asthma, with a better reaction to ICS and an increased abundance of Veillonellaceae. PC5 was typified by upregulated sputum neutrophils, reduction of Preveotllaceae abundance, and elevation of Acidaminococcaceae abundance.

Previous studies have shown that intestinal bacteria are closely related to the occurrence and development of asthma in infants and adults (8,11,18,25-29). To our knowledge, a few studies have reported on the relationships of gut microbiota with different levels of severity and serum total IgE in asthma.

Overall, our present study revealed that altered gut microbiome may be associated with the severity of asthma. Furthermore, our findings may aid in further understanding the relationship between serum IgE levels and gut microbiome dysbiosis in asthmatic patients.

Gut microbiome plays an important role in the development of asthma. Altered gut microbiome composition is related to characteristics of asthma, including the severity of asthma and phenotypes defined by serum IgE levels.
