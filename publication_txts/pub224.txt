Gut Microbiome and Its Associations With Acute and Chronic Gastrointestinal Toxicities in Cancer Patients With Pelvic Radiation Therapy: A Systematic Review



Pelvic radiation therapy (RT) can impact the gut microbiome in patients with cancer and result in gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities. The purpose of this systematic review was to describe the effects of RT on the gut microbiome and the associations between the gut microbiome and GI toxicities in patients treated with pelvic RT.

PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched from their earliest records to August 2020. The articles screening process adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The Mixed Method Assessment Tool was used to assess the methodological quality for each included study. All study findings were synthesized and presented in narrative format. Thirteen studies were included. The gut microbiome of fecal samples was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing approaches.

There were disparities in alpha and beta diversities that existed across the studies. Divergent results were found among various phyla, including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Deinococcus-Thermus. Moreover, alteration in the gut microbiome diversity and abundance related to cancer treatment was associated with pelvic toxicities, specifically diarrhea. Following treatment, increases in the abundance of Bacteroides was associated with diarrhea and radiation enteritis.

Pelvic RT can disrupt the diversity and abundance of commensal gut microorganisms. A dysbiotic gut microbiome showed a promising association with radiation enteritis through alterations of the intestinal barrier function, innate immunity, and intestinal repair mechanisms; however, confounders, such as diet, were not thoroughly addressed.

Cancer is a major public health problem across the world, and it is the second leading cause of death in the United States (1, 2). In 2020, a total of 1,806,590 new cancer cases and 606,520 cancer deaths were estimated to occur in the United States (2). Pelvic cancers, such as gynecological cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer, are among the most frequently diagnosed cancers (1, 2). Pelvic radiation therapy (RT) is a core modality primarily used to treat pelvic cancers (3, 4), with the purpose of reducing tumor size to allow surgical resection of tumors or killing tumor cells that cannot be removed via surgeries (5). With the advancement of cancer treatment modalities, including pelvic RT, the cancer mortality rate has continuously decreased, with an estimated 16.9 million cancer survivors currently alive in the United States (2, 6, 7). However, the wide use of RT has resulted in a high incidence of radiation‐induced symptoms and toxicities (8, 9). Specifically, 90% of cancer patients with pelvic RT develop a permanent change in their bowel habits (4, 10), and they may develop pelvic radiation toxicities such as radiation enteritis, radiation proctitis, and radiation cystitis post treatment (4, 11). As these patients with pelvic cancers live longer, an increasing number of them suffer for decades with RT-related gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and toxicities, all of which can significantly decrease the patients’ quality of life (QOL).

Radiation enteritis and symptoms experienced by cancer patients treated with RT is a global challenge. Understanding the impact of pelvic RT on the gut microbiome and its associations with symptoms and GI toxicities may provide a precise target to relieve symptoms and decrease patients’ suffering. The current literature reviews primarily focused on preclinical and clinical studies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of gut microbiome dysbiosis in relation to RT (8, 25). Also, to date, no systematic review was conducted with a robust methodology to evaluate the quality of the included studies using a valid tool (25). Thus, a systematic review was needed to synthesize current research regarding the impact of pelvic RT on the gut microbiome and its relationship with symptoms and GI toxicities in adult cancer patients with pelvic cancers.

A systematic review was conducted to examine: 1) the influence of pelvic RT on the gut microbiome in adult patients with pelvic cancers receiving RT; and 2) the associations between the gut microbiome and clinician-reported and patient-reported GI toxicities and symptoms among adult patients treated with pelvic RT.

With the guidance of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework (26), a systematic review was conducted by searching three databases: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Key terms used to search these databases included GI microbiome, gut microbiome, gut microflora, intestinal bacterial, microbiota composition, radiation, radiation injury, radiation toxicities, radiotherapy, pelvic radiotherapy, pelvic irradiation, and brachytherapy. All three databases were searched from their earliest records to August 2020. Detailed information for the searching process is displayed in supplementary Table S1 . The literature search process was overseen by a health science librarian from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, United States.

All the articles identified from the database searches were initially screened via title and abstract by one author (CR) and subsequently confirmed by another author (ZB) from this study. Then, all full texts for the remaining articles were retrieved and independently reviewed by two reviewers (CR and ZB) to determine study eligibility. Ambiguous studies were discussed and reviewed by the independent reviewers (CR and ZB) together with a third author (JB). Eligibility criteria for articles to be included were as follows: 1) studied the gut microbiome with next generation sequencing (e.g., 16S rRNA gene amplicon) in patients receiving pelvic RT; 2) focused on pelvic cancer populations; and 3) published in English. Articles were excluded from this study if they: 1) studied an animal model or other non-human models; 2) did not focus on pelvic cancer; 3) did not study the gut microbiome or gut microbiota with next generation sequencing approaches; or 4) were supplementary information, patents, abstracts without available full texts, or unpublished reports. When multiple studies with similar results were found to be authored by the same research team, only the most recent publication was included in this review. A secondary search of reference lists was conducted to decrease the likelihood of omitting eligible articles from this review.

A standard data extraction form was developed by our team to extract data from eligible studies. Information that was extracted from each study included: 1) characteristics of the studies according to the Johns Hopkins evidence level and quality guide (27) (e.g., authors, year of publication, origin of the study, research purpose, study design, and sample size); 2) participant information (e.g., demographics, clinical information, inclusion and exclusion criteria); 3) variables, measures, and data collection strategies; 4) data analysis; and 5) research findings and related interpretations. All study data were extracted by two authors (CR and ZB), and one author (JB) confirmed the accuracy of data extraction.

The Mixed Methods Assessment Tool (MMAT) is a scoring system designed to evaluate complex systematic literature reviews, including qualitative studies, quantitative studies (e.g., randomized controlled trials [RCTs], quasi-experimental studies, and descriptive studies), and mixed methods studies (28). Studies eligible for this review represent many types of research, so the MMAT was appropriate for quality assessment. The MMAT was updated in 2018, and the updated version of this tool was utilized for this review. This tool includes two screening criteria (applicable to all types of studies) and five domain criteria (specific to each study design), resulting in seven criteria for each study. All these questions have three response options (i.e., “yes”, “no”, or “can’t tell”) (28). An overall quality score ranges between 20% (one criterion met) and 100% (all criteria met), which is calculated using the number of domain criteria met divided by five. This tool has moderate to high reliability and has been widely used for the critical evaluation of more than 50 systematic reviews (29). The quality assessment of the included studies attempted to provide a comprehensive overview of their value and to address any potential weaknesses.

Descriptive statistics were used to describe all the eligible studies. All study findings were synthesized and presented in tables and figures using a narrative format.

We initially identified 3,402 reports for possible inclusion in this systematic review by searching three databases: PubMed (n = 92), Web of Science (n = 1905), and Embase (n = 1405). Eleven additional records were identified via the reference articles of related review papers. After reviewing the articles’ titles and abstracts, duplicate articles and other irrelevant reports (n = 3358) were removed, resulting in 55 reports requiring full text review. Among these 55 full texts, we excluded studies of animal models (n = 3), reports not including the gut microbiome (n = 10) or RT (n = 1), conference abstracts or poster presentations (n = 13), full articles in a language other than English (n = 10), and articles in which the study population did not include adults (n = 2), leading to 16 studies left for study quality review. Three articles were further excluded due to outdated methods in the gut microbiome sequencing. Thus, a total of 13 studies were included in this systematic review ( Figure 1 ).

Among these 13 included studies, 11 of them were quantitative descriptive studies, one was a quantitative non-randomized study, and one was a RCT. The sample sizes of the included studies varied from 5 to 134 participants. These studies were conducted between 2008 and 2020, primarily in the United States (n = 4), China (n = 3), South Korea (n = 2), Malaysia (n = 1), Finland (n = 1), France (n=1) and the United Kingdom (n = 1). All the included studies collected stool samples. In addition, two of the studies also collected blood samples, and one study collected gut biopsies. The gut microbiome data were sequenced using 16S rRNA targeting various gene regions. Radiation-induced GI clinician reported toxicities or patient reported symptoms were reported by seven studies, with most studies primarily focusing on diarrhea. Table 1 describes characteristics and sampling of these included studies.

Based on the MMAT quality scoring system, most of the included studies had an overall quality score of 80% or above: 80% (n = 6) and 100% (n = 5). Two studies had a quality score of 60% due to the small sample size and potential risk of inappropriate measures. Of the studies with an overall quality score of 80%, the criterion that was not met was primarily associated with the sampling strategy relevant to address the research question. Based on this assessment, none of the eligible studies were excluded from this review. Supplementary Tables S2 , S3 display the quality scores of these quantitative non-randomized studies (n = 12) and RCTs (n = 1), respectively.

A total of 11 studies were reviewed to show the impact of pelvic RT on changes in gut microbiome diversity (alpha diversity and/or beta diversity) and taxa abundance of the gut microbiome ( Table 2 ). These studies focused on a variety of pelvic cancers, including gynecological cancers only (n = 3), colorectal cancers only (n = 4), prostate cancer only (n = 1), and mixed pelvic cancers, such as gynecological, colon, and prostate cancers (n = 3). Most of the included studies reported the gut microbiome composition pre- to post-RT or chemoradiation therapy (CRT) (30–32, 34, 36, 37, 40); two studies evaluated the gut microbiome changes pre-RT, during RT, and post-RT (22, 33); two studies assessed the gut microbiome pre-RT and during RT (38, 39); and one study assessed the composition of the gut microbiome only post-CRT (37).

In addition, some studies reported various taxa by comparing different patient groups at post-RT/post-CRT. At the genus level, González-Mercado et al. found higher abundance of Muribaculaceae, Prevotella, Gemella, Bacillales Family XI, Catenibacterium, Sutterella, Pasteurellales, and Pasteurellaceae in Hispanic Puerto Ricans compared to non-Hispanic whites; however, non-Hispanic whites were enriched in Turicibacter and Eubacteriaceae compared to the Hispanic Puerto Ricans at the end of CRT (36). Jang et al. reported higher abundance of Corynebacteriales and Acholeplasmatales at the order level; of Corynebacteriaceae, Deinococcaceae, and Clostridiaceae at the family level; and of Acholeplasma, Oribacterium at the genus level in the complete response group compared to the non-complete response group (37). Also, Youssef et al. reported higher abundance of Lactobacillaceae at the family level and Lactobacillus at the genus level in patients treated with either chemotherapy and/or RT compared with the non-treated control group (32).

A total of seven studies were reviewed to show the associations between the gut microbiome and symptoms/GI toxicities among cancer patients with pelvic RT ( Table 3 ). These studies primarily focused on GI-related symptoms including diarrhea (n = 5), radiation enteritis (n = 1), and GI and urinary toxicities (n = 1).

Gonzalez-Mercado et al. (2021) , Gonzalez-Mercado et al. (2020), Nam et al. (22), Sze et al. (31), Jang et al. (37) and Youssef et al. (32) did not report the association between the gut microbiome and pelvic toxicity.

Various gut microbial taxa were found to be associated with diarrhea, bowel and urinary toxicities, and radiation enteritis. At the phylum level, a higher abundance of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria was reported in patients with diarrhea/radiation enteritis after RT compared to patients without diarrhea/radiation enteritis (23, 34). At the family level, cancer patients who developed at least two out of three symptoms (fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbance) had lower Ruminococcaceae (40). At the genus level, the relative abundance of Alistipes, Bacteroides, Clostridium_XI, Erysipelotrichaceae, Escherichia, Lachnospiracea, Roseburia, Megamonas, Clostridium IV, and Phascolarctobacterium were significantly higher, whereas Clostridium_XIVa and Sutterella were lower in patients with diarrhea compared to patients without diarrhea during and after RT (30, 33). Regarding bowel and urinary toxicities, an increase in the abundance of Phascolarctobacterium, Lachnospiraceae, Veillonella, Erysipelotrichaceae, and Fecalitalea was found in patients with high toxicity after RT compared to before RT. Meanwhile, a high abundance of Clostridiales and Desulfovibrio in patients with low toxicity and a high abundance of Sutterella, Finegoldia, and Peptococcaceae (Clostridia) in patients with high toxicity was reported from pre-RT to post-RT (38). González-Mercado et al. showed that cancer patients who developed at least two out of three symptoms had a higher abundance of Bacteroides, Blautia1, Oscillibacter, Lactobacillus, and Blautia2 after CRT (40). In terms of radiation enteritis, the abundances of the of Bacteroidaceae family, Bacteroides genus, and Plebeius species were higher in the non-radiation enteritis group compared to patients with radiation enteritis (34). Furthermore, patients with Grade 1 radiation enteritis had higher abundance of genera Virgibacillus, Alcanivorax, and Phenybacterium; and patients with Grade 2 radiation enteritis were enriched in Coprococcus, Collinsella, and rc4_4 (34).

Two intervention studies were assessed in this review. Ding et al. evaluated the efficacy of fecal microbiome transplant (FMT) on the gut microbiome pattern and symptoms in 5 women with endometrial and cervical cancers. Findings revealed that FMT increased alpha diversity and changed the composition of the microbiome in every recipient (35). Also, FMT can lower the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) grade and improve diarrhea, rectal hemorrhage, abdominal/rectal pain, fecal incontinence, and cirrhosis (35). Rosli et al. reported that consumption of 10 g partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) twice daily from 14 days before RT increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium species at the initiation of RT; however, its abundance decreased during RT (39). The impact of PHGG on GI toxicities is unclear (39).

Thirteen studies were systematically synthesized to describe the role pelvic RT plays in influencing the gut microbiome and its associations with symptoms and GI toxicities among patients with various pelvic cancers. These studies indicated that pelvic RT could lead to dysbiosis by altering the diversity and abundance of the gut microbiome. A lower alpha diversity, dissimilarity in beta diversity, and decreased relative abundance of the healthy-associated gut microbes seemed to be associated with GI toxicities such as diarrhea and radiation enteritis. However, these studies have very specific limitations, including small sample size, using different tools to measure toxicities, diversity of patient populations, combination of multiple pelvic cancers at different stages, RT dose, use of concurrent chemotherapy as another systematic treatment, the use of diverse DNA sequencing approaches (e.g., 16S rRNA V1-V9 gene regions), and using different methodologies to describe the gut microbiome diversity and composition (i.e., definition of operational taxonomic unit (OTU), and sequencing read processing), all of which further complicate the interpretation of inconsistent findings. Moreover, cofounding factors such as diet, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, changes in BMI pre- to post-treatment, and use of antibiotics, were not systematically measured in the included studies, which may affect the results.

This study has several limitations. According to our results, it is not possible to causatively link any of those significantly identified taxa to the etiology of RT-induced enteropathy. The current study synthesized data related to both acute and late toxicities related to RT. These promising findings should be further examined in a large sample size by considering confounding factors, such as diet, and using standard methods to measure symptoms and gut microbiome profiles so that confirmed findings can be used to improve the clinical practice among patients with cancer receiving pelvic RT. Secondly, radiation enteropathy has multiple causes, which are likely to have differential contributions from the gut microbiome. So far, no objective markers of radiation enteropathy have been defined, and there is no option but to rely on abnormal outcomes, primarily measured by clinician-reported toxicities or patient-reported symptoms. Finally, this study systematically reviewed all the articles using next generation sequencing and published in English only, which may lead to some data selection biases.

Pelvic RT can disrupt the diversity and abundance of commensal gut microorganisms. A dysbiotic gut microbiome showed promising associations with pelvic radiation enteropathy and toxicities through alterations of intestinal barrier function, innate immunity, and intestinal repair mechanisms. The conflicting reports on microbial diversity and abundance may be attributed to cofounding factors within the complicated relationship between the gut microbiome and RT enteropathy. This may limit our ability to clearly define the unique contribution of the gut microbiome in RT enteropathy, and this important relationship warrants further investigations. A better understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in RT-induced symptoms and GI toxicities may lead to new therapeutic approaches and the identification of predictive markers of RT-induced GI toxicities.
