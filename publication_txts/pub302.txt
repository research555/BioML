Toxicomicrobiomics: The Human Microbiome vs. Pharmaceutical, Dietary, and Environmental Xenobiotics

The harmful impact of xenobiotics on the environment and human health is being more widely recognized; yet, inter- and intraindividual genetic variations among humans modulate the extent of harm, mostly through modulating the outcome of xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification. As the Human Genome Project revealed that host genetic, epigenetic, and regulatory variations could not sufficiently explain the complexity of interindividual variability in xenobiotics metabolism, its sequel, the Human Microbiome Project, is investigating how this variability may be influenced by human-associated microbial communities. Xenobiotic-microbiome relationships are mutual and dynamic. Not only does the human microbiome have a direct metabolizing potential on xenobiotics, but it can also influence the expression of the host metabolizing genes and the activity of host enzymes. On the other hand, xenobiotics may alter the microbiome composition, leading to a state of dysbiosis, which is linked to multiple diseases and adverse health outcomes, including increased toxicity of some xenobiotics. Toxicomicrobiomics studies these mutual influences between the ever-changing microbiome cloud and xenobiotics of various origins, with emphasis on their fate and toxicity, as well the various classes of microbial xenobiotic-modifying enzymes. This review article discusses classic and recent findings in toxicomicrobiomics, with examples of interactions between gut, skin, urogenital, and oral microbiomes with pharmaceutical, food-derived, and environmental xenobiotics. The current state and future prospects of toxicomicrobiomic research are discussed, and the tools and strategies for performing such studies are thoroughly and critically compared.

Xenobiotics are chemical substances not normally present in the environment of living organisms. They are mostly regarded as synthetic substances, but the term may be more loosely used to include naturally occurring chemicals and endobiotics, when present in higher concentrations than their normal levels, or produced by certain organisms as a defense mechanism, such as the toxins produced by some fungi, bacteria, or even herbs (Soucek, 2011). From a metabolism viewpoint, they can be defined as chemicals that are extrinsic to the normal metabolism of a living organism (Koppel et al., 2017). Food with its variety of dietary compounds, environmental chemicals and pollutants, as well as medications are considered xenobiotics to the human body (Koppel et al., 2017).

Poorly absorbed xenobiotics pass from the small intestine to the large intestine, where they are exposed to the gut microbial metabolizing niche. Metabolites released in the circulation are either excreted by the kidneys or return through biliary duct to the gut. The final fate of these metabolites is either excretion in the stool or reabsorption in the small intestine (Koppel et al., 2017).

The efficiency of the host metabolizing enzymes varies from one individual to another according to the individual’s genetic makeup. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are among the reasons why individuals respond differently to xenobiotics and drugs (Soucek, 2011). Pharmacogenomics studies the impact of genetic discrepancies between individuals (usually SNPs) on their responses to drugs (Rizkallah et al., 2010; Saad et al., 2012). For example, genetic variants in uridine 5′-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) render some patients to slowly metabolize certain drugs such as NSAIDs and irinotecan due to lower glucuronidation rates (Lankisch et al., 2008; Stingl et al., 2014).

Although the host enzymes (notably liver enzymes) are variable and capable of metabolizing xenobiotics, their variability alone cannot explain the biotransformation of indigestible xenobiotics and dietary compounds. Human and microbial chemical transformations form a complex interchangeable network, in which they mutually affect one other (Soucek, 2011).

The microbiota is defined as all the microbial communities living on or in a particular biological system, formerly referred to as flora or microflora. The human body carries trillions of microbes with genes estimated to be at least 100 times more numerous than human coding genes. The term microbiome, disambiguated elsewhere (Saad et al., 2012), refers to a micro-ecosystem (micro.biome) or the summation of a microbiota and the genomes of its members (microbial metagenome). Sometimes it even describes the entire environment in which microbes reside (Marchesi and Ravel, 2015). Finally, microbiomics is defined as the field that uses “high throughput molecular techniques to study microbial communities” (Rajendhran and Gunasekaran, 2010).

A human’s microbiome, from one’s birth throughout his/her life, continuously evolves, impacting the body in both states of health and disease. Variations within a microbiome are not only developmental, but are also spatial, temporal, and are definitely affected by diet, hormones, stress, and even diurnal cycle. This continuous, multidimensional variability makes an individual’s microbiome akin to a cloud, with uncertainty of the exact composition and gene pool at any point of time and space (Elrakaiby et al., 2014).

After the Human Genome Project (HGP) has come to a conclusion in 2003, researchers were baffled by its unexpected results (Relman and Falkow, 2001). Coding genes in the human genome were found to be much fewer than previously expected. The genetic, epigenetic, and regulatory variations in the human genome were not sufﬁcient to explain the complexity of interindividual variability and its associated phenotypes. The human microbiome came then to the spotlight, with the promise that studying its composition, variability, and functional potential will allow the full understanding of the landscape of human phenotypic variations, and its effect on human health, immunity, and drug response.

In parallel to the rising excitement about microbiome research, which sometimes mixes established science with publicity, a handful of applications are revitalized, notably in the use of probiotics, functional foods, and nutraceuticals, and novel research areas are taking shape. Of these, two areas of research have expanded that relate to microbial interactions with chemicals to which the host is exposed: pharmacomicrobiomics is a relatively new field that investigates the interactions between human-associated microbes and drugs (Rizkallah et al., 2010) and toxicomicrobiomics is a branch of toxicology that extends toxicogenomics to exploring xenobiotic-microbiome interactions (Aziz et al., 2018).

Early data collected from the HMP (Turnbaugh et al., 2007) showed that samples from different body sites (oral, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and urogenital tract) contained unique microbial communities in the same individual. Surprisingly, researchers also found that if samples were drawn from two different individuals, one individual’s oral sample will look more similar to the other’s oral sample than his or her own skin sample (Turnbaugh et al., 2007).

In either case (correlation or causation), microbiome-driven biomarkers are valuable diagnostics. In the case of mere correlation, these biomarkers would be signs of exposure to a certain adverse health outcome, while, when causation is established, microbiome biomarkers are of predictive value (e.g., Fusobacterium nucleatum (Kostic et al., 2013; Rubinstein et al., 2013) and signature microbial metabolites (Vipperla and O’keefe, 2016) as predictors of colorectal cancer).

With its immense diversity, the human microbiome has a powerful metabolizing capacity that even exceeds its host’s metabolic potential. The human gut microbiome, in particular, is capable of the biotransformation of xenobiotics starting from dietary compounds to pharmaceutical ingredients. The microbiome can change xenobiotics half-lives, their potential biological effect on the human body, and the rate and extent by which they reach the blood circulation or their biological targets/receptors (Koppel et al., 2017). Whether a xenobiotic is poorly absorbed and passes through the host’s small into large intestine, binds to one of the efflux proteins, or whether it is absorbed into the circulation, it will be exposed at some stage to the microbiota and its enzymes (Hall et al., 1999). The less a xenobiotic is absorbed or the more it is bound to proteins, the longer it resides in the gut and the more it is exposed to variable microbial enzymes (Hall et al., 1999). Microbial enzymes can activate prodrugs, inactivate drugs or increase or alleviate toxicity of others (Spanogiannopoulos et al., 2016; Kuntz and Gilbert, 2017; Wilson and Nicholson, 2017). The gut microbiome may also indirectly influence the host’s capacity to metabolize xenobiotics or drugs (Koppel et al., 2017).

Gut microbiota-derived metabolites of steroid hormones, uremic solutes of dietary protein breakdown or herbal medicines, or bile acids may decrease CYP3A4 expression (Bjorkholm et al., 2009; Devlin et al., 2016). Low CYP3A4 results in less clearance of multiple CYP3A4-dependant medications, e.g., erythromycin and verapamil, affecting their action and adverse effects (Barnes et al., 2014).

The use of pharmaceutical products is undoubtedly on the rise over the past decades. According to the Global Use of Medicines report from the IQVIA Institute for human data science, the global market for pharmaceuticals reached $1.2 trillion in 2018, up $100 billion from 2017 (The Iqvia Institute, 2019). With the availability of pharmacies around every corner offering over-the-counter pharmaceutical products and the increasing number of patients with chronic illnesses, using such products becomes an integral part of our everyday lives. Effects of pharmaceuticals on the human body have long been studied, but with the importance of the microbiome lately being rediscovered, study results are accruing on the mutual interplay between pharmaceuticals and the microbiome.

As previously established, different body sites (oral, skin, gastrointestinal tract and urogenital tract) contain unique microbial communities (Turnbaugh et al., 2007), each of which interacts with pharmaceuticals in a different way (affecting and being affected by them). Some interactions may lead to an increase or a decrease in activity, while others result in increased toxicity of a pharmaceutical xenobiotic ( Table 2 ), which fall within the scope of toxicomicrobiomics.

As defined earlier, the gut microbiota, which is the largest microbial community in the human body, contains trillions of microorganisms (bacteria, archaea and micro-eukaryotes), including more than 1,000 different species of bacteria (Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes being the two major phyla in most cases), with more than 3 million genes. The gut microbiota is characteristic in each individual, and only one third of it is shared between different people. Studies on the gut microbiota constitute more than 80% of the overall publications on human microbiome (Cani, 2018), which reflects both the importance of its role in human health and the booming research in that area.

Ranitidine, an H2 Blocker, was found to be differentially degraded depending on the presence of gut bacteria with ability to cleave an N-oxide bond (Basit and Lacey, 2001). Insulin, an anabolic hormone and a peptide drug, was found to be degraded by some proteolytic enzymes produced by the gut microbiota, rendering it ineffective (Tozaki et al., 1997). Metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, was found to be more effective orally than parenterally because of gut-based pharmacological effects (Napolitano et al., 2014).

The human skin is the largest body organ and it plays an essential role in the body’s natural immunity together with its associated microbial communities. The skin microbiota has more than 19 major phyla (Grice et al., 2009) and defends the human body against pathogens. These defense mechanisms include releasing antimicrobial peptides, maintaining pH and competing with pathogens for available nutritional resources.

Owing to its direct contact with the environment, the skin microbiota continuously interacts with, and thus adapts to, environmental xenobiotics. Studies have recently unveiled the role of topical xenobiotics on skin microbiota. For example, a study conducted on infants revealed that emollients resulted in decreased skin pH and increased bacterial richness, diversity, and abundance of Streptococcus salivarius, which seemed to improve atopic dermatitis treatment (Glatz et al., 2018). Chitosan is a natural biopolymer with immunomodulatory and antimicrobial properties. The inclusion of chitosan in coating textiles may reduce atopic dermatitis severity by modulating skin staphylococcal communities (Lopes et al., 2015). Additionally, topical treatment with coal tar in atopic dermatitis was found to decrease the abundance of Staphylococcus aureus and increase that of Propionibacterium on the skin, shifting the microbiome into a healthier state (Smits et al., 2019).

The female urinary system is sterile in its normal state as a result of the urea content, which inhibits microbial growth, the mechanical flushing of pathogens by urine, and the lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide secreted by vaginal lactobacilli.

Like with other body sites, the urogenital microbiota mutually interacts with pharmaceutical xenobiotics. For example, tenofovir, an antiviral used in the treatment of HIV, was found to be metabolically depleted in African women by Gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobic bacteria (Klatt et al., 2017). Combined oral contraceptives were shown to be associated with increased vaginal colonization by healthy lactobacilli, and with reduced bacterial vaginosis-associated taxa in another study (Brooks et al., 2017). Contraceptive rings were found to decrease the severity of bacterial vaginosis in African women by promoting the growth of vaginal lactobacilli and decreasing the abundance of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae (Crucitti et al., 2018).

The interaction between the oral microbiome and xenobiotics has long been studied as the microbial community of the oral cavity is constantly subjected to habits of eating, drinking and smoking that affect and change the oral microbiome on a daily basis.

In a recent study, silver, titanium dioxide, and iron nanoparticles were found to have the lowest inhibitory and antibiofilm concentration against dental caries-causing bacteria like Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis, when compared to other nanoparticle-containing solutions, antibiotics, and chlorhexidine (Lavaee et al., 2016). Hyaluronic acid treatment in peri-implantitis was found to decrease the severity of the disease by decreasing the abundance of colonizing bacteria (Soriano-Lerma et al., 2019). The antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of abietic acid on Streptococcus mutans growth was recognized as a potential protective measure against dental caries (Ito et al., 2019b). Of note, silver nanoparticles have complex interactions with mucosal and intestinal microbiomes (reviewed in Bi et al., 2020).

Food is the source of energy and nutrients for the human body to grow, develop, and carry on everyday activities. The global human population is increasing over time, with incremental needs for ongoing food resources (Eshel et al., 2014). With this large demand, people have incorporated much more processed foods and artificial products into their diet to keep up with the rapid pace of their lifestyles. The enzymatic reserve of the gut microbiota has proven to play a pivotal role in metabolizing dietary compounds of natural, processed, or even artificial origins and making use of their metabolized products as a source of carbon or energy, not only for the microbiota itself, but also for the human host (Sharon et al., 2014).

Non-caloric artificial sweeteners are currently consumed to give a sweet taste with much fewer or no calories. In one experiment, saccharin, sucralose, or aspartame were administered to mice in their drinking water. Consequently, mice developed marked glucose intolerance with distinct altered microbial composition (Suez et al., 2015). Xylitol, another food additive used to protect against caries, is capable of changing gut microbiota in mice, especially decreasing phylum Bacteroidetes, and enriching phylum Firmicutes and genus Prevotella (Uebanso et al., 2017). Benzoic acid is a preservative added to food to prevent bacterial and fungal growth. Dietary and supplement benzoic acid were proved to reduce Lactobacillus and E. coli in pig intestines (Mao et al., 2019). Emulsifiers, such as carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate-80, caused microbial dysbiosis in mice and promoted low-grade inflammation which is one of the causes of metabolic syndrome (Chassaing et al., 2015).

Environmental pollutants and chemicals have become an integral part of the surroundings of people. It is becoming necessary to include the microbiome in considering the safety and toxicity of these compounds, as microbial enzymes can alter their half-life and dynamics (Koppel et al., 2017). Melamine is used as raw material for manufacturing adhesives, paints, tables, and engineered wood. Melamine traces were found in soil and wastewater close to melamine factories (Wang et al., 2014a). In 2008, melamine toxicity led to the death of children because of gut microbial transformation of melamine to cyanuric acid. The latter form is an insoluble complex that precipitates in the kidney and causes kidney stones and is biotransformed by Klebsiella terrigena, together with Pseudomonas spp. strain A (NRRL B-12227), Rhodococcus corallinus (NRRL B15444R), Klebsiella terrigena DRS-1 (ATCC 700372), Rhodococcus sp. strain Mel, Nocardioides sp. strain ATD6, and the novel bacterium CY1 or Melaminivora alkalimesophila gen. nov., sp. nov (Zheng et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014b).

Triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol, TCS) is another broad-spectrum antimicrobial added to personal use products including cosmetics and toys (Halden, 2014; Poole et al., 2016). In a recent study on mice, TCS affected beneficial gut microbiota such as Bifidobacterium. TCS treatment also caused colonic inflammation in conventionally raised mice, supporting the evidence that gut microbiota plays a role in TCS-caused inflammation (Yang et al., 2018).

The tools for studying toxicomicrobiomics, as well as pharmacomicrobiomics, are no different from the general tools used to decode the microbiome at different levels: its taxonomic and genomic composition, gene content, functional potential, actual expression of its genes (at the RNA or protein level), and finally its actual function as reflected by the combined microbiome-derived metabolites. As such, microbiome profiling by amplicon sequencing, shotgun microbiome sequencing or metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, as well as metabolomics and metabonomics are all valid tools for the analysis of xenobiotic-microbiome interactions ( Table 3 ).

Using the above-mentioned ‘omics analysis technologies ( Table 3 ), systematic studies need to be conducted to unearth new toxicomicrobiomic interactions. Strategies for these studies should benefit from environmental metagenomic approaches that seek to discover, for example, microbes and enzymes with biodegradation capabilities (Sayed et al., 2014; Bouhajja et al., 2016; Ngara and Zhang, 2018), or from pharmacomicrobiomic discovery methodologies (Bisanz et al., 2018). A remarkable example is the recent high-throughput systematic pharmacomicrobiomic screens to detect specific drug-bacterial interactions and separate them from drug-host interaction (e.g., Zimmermann et al., 2019a; Zimmermann et al., 2019b). Overall, experimental strategies, combining (wet) laboratory and computational (in silico approaches) may be classified into culture-based, sequencing-based, functional screening-based, and innovative hybrid strategies.

All culture-based methods offer great advantage as they allow actual experimentation and screening; however, this strategy remains biased as it enriches our knowledge about many already well-studied organisms. Culture-independent technologies were specifically developed to overcome this type of knowledge bias.

Accruing reliable information about an individual’s microbiome may aid in preventing and treating certain diseases (Kosyakovsky, 2017). It may also lead to a decrease in the toxicity of some medications or the improvement in the efficacy of others (Haiser and Turnbaugh, 2012). A comprehensive “microbiome panel” may eventually be available as a routine laboratory screening to provide a microbiome profile of an individual and help defining the various options for a “healthy” microbiome. Once variants of healthy microbiomes and their biomarkers are defined, biomarkers for dysbiosis and disease susceptibility may also be defined. Consequently, xenobiotic-degrading bacterial taxa (or biomarkers thereof) may also be easily analyzed in the near future, and may be used in several therapeutic and toxicological decisions.

In this final section of the review, we propose ideas for practitioners, clinicians, and investigators in the field of microbiome research and its impact on human health.

There is a scarcity of databases of ready curated knowledge for extraction by practitioners and investigators which may cost valuable time, resulting in hindering of the research or deterring researchers from conducting any investigation in the field. For this reason, building databases with such curated knowledge or helping already established databases as a volunteer team member, crowdsourcer or crowdfunder is a must for the advancement of the field. Specifically, linking toxicology databases, chemical databases, and drug banks to pharmacogenomic and pharmacomicrobiomic data resources is becoming a pressing need

Building predictive models and developing software for simulating drug-microbiome interactions are essential as they will strongly reduce cost and researchers time. The only limitation to develop such models is the availability of curated knowledge, from which robust hypotheses can be driven and used for training and validating the model. Chemical similarity searches, if combined to gene/protein similarity searches, may allow the prediction of novel interactions between xenobiotic chemical moieties and different microbial enzymes.

As detailed above, the human microbiome is a rich source for discovery of biomarkers for diseases and adverse health outcomes. Using such biomarkers as non-invasive alternatives to biopsies and endoscopy, for example, would be a promising futuristic diagnostic (Ren et al., 2019) and predictive/preventive tool (Penalver Bernabe et al., 2018). For example, the human microbiota was found to release molecules and metabolites that affect the onset, progression, and treatment of cancer (Scott et al., 2019; Rao et al., 2020). True personalized cancer therapy may only be achieved through a full understanding of the effect of microbiome on chemotherapy ( Table 2 ) and tumorigenesis, thus allowing proper patient stratification—based on specific biomarkers, microbiome types, and metabotypes (Rizkallah et al., 2010; Kuntz and Gilbert, 2017). Although inter-individual microbial diversity, emergence of novel and multiresistant microbial strains, and various microbial drug modification mechanisms may complicate or delay precision medicine, it remains the right choice for future theranotstics.

Hopefully, the availability of online resources, biomarker discovery, development of assays, models, and software, and conducting more research will help practitioners and investigators to develop novel guidelines for clinical practice, and to implement guidelines for some of the well-established xenobiotic-microbe and xenobiotic-microbial enzyme interactions.
