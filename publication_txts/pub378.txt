The Use of Probiotic Therapy in Metabolic and Neurological Diseases

The human gut is home to trillions of microbes that interact with host cells to influence and contribute to body functions. The number of scientific studies focusing on the gut microbiome has exponentially increased in recent years. Studies investigating factors that may potentially affect the gut microbiome and may be used for therapeutic purposes in diseases where dysbioses in the gut microbiome have been shown are of particular interest. This review compiles current evidence available in the scientific literature on the use of probiotics to treat metabolic diseases and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) to analyze the efficacy of probiotics in these diseases. To do this, we must first define the healthy gut microbiome before looking at the interplay between the gut microbiome and diseases, and how probiotics affect this interaction. In metabolic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, probiotic supplementation positively impacts pathological parameters. Conversely, the gut–brain axis significantly impacts neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASDs. However, manipulating the gut microbiome and disease symptoms using probiotics has less pronounced effects on neurodevelopmental diseases. This may be due to a more complex interplay between genetics and the environment in these diseases. In conclusion, the use of microbe-based probiotic therapy may potentially have beneficial effects in ameliorating the pathology of various diseases. Validation of available data for the development of personalized treatment regimens for affected patients is still required.

The gut is a natural habitat for trillions of diverse microbes (anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and bacteriophages) where the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria are the most common (1). The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem where microbes and their metabolites interact with host cells to influence body functions. General health is associated with a “healthy” microbiome, defined by the diversity and types of species of bacteria within the gut.

With the plethora of probiotics and associated products now available commercially, it is no wonder that there have been many misconceptions regarding probiotics, their usage, and their health benefits, which we will address in the subsequent sections of this review.

Specific health benefits have been ascribed to particular probiotic strains, and therefore, not all probiotic supplements are equal, even if they list the same species of probiotic bacteria. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the correct strain is used to treat the underlying clinical issue. Additionally, supplements that contain multiple strains of bacteria may also lack the scientific evidence for the claimed benefits.

The most common bacterial species used in current probiotic products are lactic acid bacteria such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains (24). However, recent studies have identified other species of bacteria that may also confer benefits when used as probiotics, such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (25), and the use of these bacteria in probiotic products is rising as well (26). The effectiveness of probiotic supplementation can be measured through the bacterial load in the feces, or other measures within the body (27, 28), and is essential to establish the efficacy of any treatment.

The benefits of probiotic supplementation result from either inhibition of pathogen growth in the large intestine or augmented immune response and intestinal barrier function in both small and large intestines (29). As most probiotics are beneficial bacteria found naturally within the gut, ingested probiotics within the gut interact with immune cells to sustain an immunologic balance within the gastrointestinal tract (30, 31). Therefore, the interplay between the gut microbiome, probiotics, and human health is via the modulation of immune responses at the epithelial cells constituting the mucosal interface between host and microorganisms.

Regular consumption of probiotic supplements and foods has ascribed numerous scientifically backed benefits, including effects on the gut such as amelioration of diarrhea and other digestive symptoms (33–38), reduction of inflammation (33, 39), as well as benefits to various conditions ranging from emotional imbalance to autoimmune diseases (40–45). Some groups have even shown the benefits of consuming probiotics for patients with cancer (28, 46, 47). However, it must be noted that while many clinical benefits have been rigorously tested, in many cases, probiotics cannot be considered an alternative to medicine, particularly in severe diseases.

Knowledge of a healthy gut microbiome is necessary before addressing the diseases triggered by the dysregulation of the gut microbiome. Hou et al. (51) established three enterotypes comprising specific species and functional composition: Bacteroides, Blautia, and Prevotella enterotypes. These different gut microbiome diversity signatures have different risks for different diseases (48–50). Additionally, the efficacy of probiotic supplementation is also affected by enterotype (51). Therefore, these enterotypes may form a basal gut microbiome that is independent of geographical location as well as nutrition.

Consequently, a healthy gut microbiome is essential for both metabolic and neurological health. In the following sub-sections, we will be addressing the use of probiotics in metabolic diseases (obesity and type II diabetes) and neurodegenerative diseases.

Obesity is defined by excessive fat accumulation in the body, which may increase the risk of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, some cancers, and hypertension (70). The gut microbiome and the composition of dietary intake are profoundly linked (71). For example, the intake of animal-based foods provided up to 5 consecutive days of increased bile-tolerant microbes (Alistipes, Bilophila, and Bacteroides) and reduced the amount of fiber-fermenting bacteria (72).

Hence, probiotics positively impact the reduction of relevant obesity parameters, although the effect varies across the different age groups and genders. More standardized studies are needed to investigate how the different mixtures of bacterial species in probiotics affect different age groups and genders.

Type-2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder in which individuals display abnormally high blood glucose, resulting from inadequate insulin secretion and resistance (85). Type 2 diabetes results from the interaction between environmental factors and genetic factors (86). One of the primary risk factors of type-2 diabetes is being overweight or obese (87).

Probiotic intake, such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, leads to improvement in intestinal integrity, reduced lipopolysaccharide level, reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress, and improved insulin sensitivity (91–93). Animal and clinical trials have shown that both single probiotic strains or mixtures of probiotics have the potential to improve type-2 diabetes parameters (87, 94). More research is required to dissect the most suitable species impacting gut metabolism, as well as exposure time, and dose.

Autism spectrum disorder is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders defined by deficits in communication and social interaction, and stereotyped behaviors (65). GI abnormalities are common among individuals with ASD (95, 96), with a strong correlation of GI symptoms with ASD severity (97).

Autism spectrum disorder individuals are highly selective eaters (102, 103); therefore dietary factors remain a strong confounding factor for these individuals. The complex interplay between host genetics, environment, and the microbiome although challenging to dissect are important factors to consider. Larger longitudinal trials as well as optimizing dosage, formulation (single vs. multispecies probiotics), timing (101), route of administration as well as toxicity concerns remain to be addressed to validate the efficacy of probiotics for ASD, taking into consideration age and population-specific differences in gut microbiota/metabolites produced (6, 7).

It is well-established that age is a primary risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases due to increased insults including decreased neurotransmitter levels, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis (104). There is also a high prevalence of GI comorbidities among patients with Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases (105, 106). Dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota in the elderly may result in a leaky gut, and subsequently, promote systemic and neuroinflammation (107).

A key limitation of current probiotic studies for PD and AD is the small sample sizes (n < 100). Consistent study designs in larger human trials with validated safety and efficacy are required before translation into clinical settings.

Manipulation of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites to address challenging questions in metabolic and brain disorders is difficult due to the complex relationship between host genetics and environmental factors to influence the gut microbiota. A healthy diet and exercise positively modify the gut microbiota (117–119), therefore it remains inevitable to tackle these key modifiable factors to ensure a healthy community of microbes.

The long-term effects of probiotics and their corresponding metabolites/substances on health are needed to fully understand the mechanisms of each probiotic strain on health (120). Delineation of the precise role and effect of each probiotic strain may just be the beginning of introducing precise probiotic strain for an exact clinical disease. This delineation may be followed by combined efforts of various strains of probiotics. In short, the journey into the gut microbiome is just the tip of the iceberg at the moment.
