Ketogenic diet alleviates colitis by reduction of colonic group 3 innate lymphoid cells through altering gut microbiome

Accumulating evidence suggests that ketogenic diets (KDs) mediate the rise of circulating ketone bodies and exert a potential anti-inflammatory effect; however, the consequences of this unique diet on colitis remain unknown. We performed a series of systematic studies using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) animal model of inflammatory colitis. Animals were fed with a KD, low-carbohydrate diet (LCD), or normal diet (ND). Germ-free mice were utilized in validation experiments. Colon tissues were analyzed by transcriptome sequencing, RT2 profiler PCR array, histopathology, and immunofluorescence. Serum samples were analyzed by metabolic assay kit. Fecal samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. We observed that KD alleviated colitis by altering the gut microbiota and metabolites in a manner distinct from LCD. Quantitative diet experiments confirmed the unique impact of KD relative to LCD with a reproducible increase in Akkermansia, whereas the opposite was observed for Escherichia/Shigella. After colitis induction, the KD protected intestinal barrier function, and reduced the production of RORγt+CD3− group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) and related inflammatory cytokines (IL-17α, IL-18, IL-22, Ccl4). Finally, fecal microbiota transplantation into germ-free mice revealed that the KD- mediated colitis inhibition and ILC3 regulation were dependent on the modification of gut microbiota. Taken together, our study presents a global view of microbiome-metabolomics changes that occur during KD colitis treatment, and identifies the regulation of gut microbiome and ILC3s as novel targets involving in IBD dietary therapy.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complicated chronic inflammatory disease that involves various genetic and environmental driving factors.1 Although its pathogenesis is poorly understood, an increasing number of studies have highlighted that dietary intake plays a key role in disease occurrence due to its underlying effects on gut microbiota, barrier function, and mucosal immunity.2 For instance, a high-salt diet has been shown to exacerbate intestinal inflammation by reducing Lactobacillus abundance and butyrate metabolism,3 while a high-fat diet has been found to contribute toward IBD progression by activating proinflammatory signaling and disrupting barrier systems.4 Although exclusive enteral nutrition has shown clinical promise for promoting Crohn’s disease remission, it remains unclear whether dietary therapy would help to treat ulcerative colitis.5 Therefore, the discovery of novel anti-inflammatory dietary strategies is urgently required to manage IBD.

In this study, we compared the gut microbiome and metabolic changes in mice fed with a KD, low-carbohydrate diet (LCD), or normal diet (ND). In addition, we investigated the effect of a KD on inflammation, the gut microbiome, mucosal barriers, and immunity using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model. Finally, we clarified the beneficial effects of the KD-modified gut microbiome on intestinal inflammation using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in a germ-free (GF) mouse model. Our findings suggest that KD is a promising dietary therapy for intestinal inflammation and demonstrate its modulatory effect on gut microbiota.

Before inducing colitis, we analyzed the effects of a KD and LCD on the fecal microbiota of mice after 16 weeks of dietary intervention (Fig.
1a). As shown in Fig.
1b, the Chao1 index was significantly lower in the KD and LCD groups than in the ND group; however, no significant differences in the Shannon index were observed between the KD/LCD and ND groups (Fig.
1c). Unweighted PCoA analysis indicated a clear distinction between the KD, LCD, and ND groups (Fig.
1d). At the phylum level (Fig.
1e), the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and relative abundance of Proteobacteria were higher in the KD and LCD groups than in the ND group. At the genus level (Fig.
1f), Akkermansia and Roseburia were more abundant in the KD group than in the other groups, while Alloprevotella is most abundant in ND. Linear discriminant analysis coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe) revealed that Oscillibacter was enriched in the LCD group while Akkermansia, Roseburia, and Ruminococcaceae were enriched in the KD group (Fig.
1g, Supplementary Fig. 1a). The functional potential of gut microbiota was analyzed using PICRUSt and LEfSe (Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) score > 3.0, p < 0.05), indicating that bacterial motility proteins and bacterial chemotaxis were over-represented in the microbiome of the LCD group compared to the KD and ND groups, while the function “bacterial invasion of epithelial cells” was over-represented in the KD group (Supplementary Fig. 1b).

To clarify the effects of a KD and LCD on bacterial metabolites, we used GC-MS and UHPLC-HRMS/MS to identify the fecal metabolite spectra of mice after 16-weeks dietary intervention. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plots showed a distinct separation between the metabolites of the three groups (Supplementary Fig. 1c), of which 26 were screened as being significantly different and divided into two clusters based on their concentration profiles, including metabolite clusters dominant in LCD (e.g., terephthalic acid, stercobilin) and KD/ND (e.g., l-asparagine, glycolic acid; Fig.
1h). Details of these metabolites are provided in Supplementary Table 1. Straightforward associations between bacteria and metabolites were demonstrated using correlation heatmaps (Fig.
1i), indicating that KD-dominated Akkermansia and ND-dominated Alloprevotella correlated negatively with several LCD-dominant metabolites such as terephthalic acid and stercobilin. These results suggest that quantitative induction of ketogenesis relative to ND can effectively alter the gut microbiota and metabolites.

As shown in Fig.
2a, LCD significantly promoted weight gain in mice before colitis induction whereas no significant weight gain difference was observed between the KD and ND groups, consistent with the Lee index of colitis-induced mice (Fig.
2b). We also measured the weight of fat in the epididymal white adipose tissues of colitis-induced mice, finding that it was significantly higher in the LCD-C group than in the KD-C or ND-C groups (Fig.
2c, d). Similar results were observed when comparing the fat vesicles of livers from each group (Fig.
2e, f). Finally, we detected that serum glucose levels were significantly lower in the KD group than in the LCD or ND groups (Fig.
2g), whereas serum BOH levels were significantly higher (Fig.
2h). These results demonstrated, LCD significantly promoted the body weight, while KD significantly altered the glucose and BOH metabolism of the mice before and after colitis induction.

The survival curves of each group following induction of colitis are shown in Fig.
3a. None of the mice in the KD-C group died during the experiment, whereas four and three mice died in the LCD-C and ND-C groups, respectively. In addition, mice in the LCD-C group were more likely to have hemafecia and shortened colons than those in the KD-C or ND-C groups, while mice in the KD-C group had less hemafecia and prolonged colons than in the ND-C group (Fig. 3b, c). Furthermore, mice in the KD-C group had less weight loss and disease activity index (DAI) scores than those in the ND-C group, while the opposite was observed in the LCD-C group (Fig. 3d, e). H&E staining revealed that the KD-C group displayed less inflammatory cell infiltration in the intestinal epithelium than the ND-C group, whereas the LCD-C group displayed more infiltration (Fig. 3f, g). Finally, the KD lowered serum LPS levels compared to the ND, but the LCD increased LPS levels (Fig.
3h).

Next, we evaluated the effect of KD and LCD on barrier function in mice with DSS-induced colitis by using immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry to detect barrier-related proteins in harvested colon tissues (Fig.
3i). The KD significantly increased Occludin, ZO-1, and MUC-2 expression in the intestinal epithelium compared to the ND, whereas the opposite was observed for the LCD. These findings were confirmed by quantitative PCR (Fig.
3j), while PAS staining revealed that the KD and LCD increased and decreased the number of goblet cells in the colon compared to the ND, respectively (Fig.
3k). Our results highlight how KD are distinctive from LCD in both the inflammatory colitis and intestinal barrier function.

To investigate the underlying mechanisms for KD or LCD-mediated colitis and barrier function changes, we performed the transcriptome sequencing using the colon tissues from KD, LCD and ND after colitis induction (n = 3 per group). Using a cut off of p < 0.01, 1643 differentially expressed genes were selected (Fig.
4a and Supplementary Table 2). To understand the biological functions potentially regulated by these genes, further investigations based on Gene Ontology (GO) database were made. The results revealed these genes may be involved in inflammatory response, immune system process, immune response, response to lipopolysaccharide, and neutrophil chemotaxis (Fig.
4b). Then, Cytoscape software was used to predict the interaction between top 20 genes selected according to their corrected p-values and fold change values (Fig.
4c). Among the gene sets significantly enriched in LCD-C, genes associated with cell chemotaxis (Ccl4, Ccl11, IL-1β) and immune/inflammatory response (Tnf, IL-10, IL-1r1, IL-17α) were present and interacted. To validate the transcriptome sequencing, additional mouse inflammatory response and autoimmunity PCR arrays were used to profile the expression of 84 key genes involved in inflammatory response affected by KD or LCD (n = 4 per group). The data showed up-regulation of 15 candidate genes in the LCD-C vs. KD-C groups (Fig.
4d). Literature review identified two mucosal inflammation- and immunity-related pathways implicated by these genes: ILC3 effector cytokines (including IL-17α, IL-22, and IL-18) and monocyte chemotaxis (including Ccl4 and Ccl12; Fig.
4e). Notably, IL-22 may directly regulate barrier function or indirectly exert this role through producing IL-18.12 Thus, PCR assays validated that colon tissues from the KD-C and LCD-C groups displayed lower and higher IL-22, IL-17α, IL-18, and Ccl4 expression than the ND-C group, respectively (Fig.
4f). Furthermore, immunofluorescence indicated that colon epithelium from the LCD-C and ND-C groups was enriched with more RORγt+CD3− ILC3 cells than the KD-C group, most of which were concentrated in cryptopatches. (Fig. 4g, h). Taken together, we found that the inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and ILC3 cells are the targets of KD in inhibiting colitis.

To clarify the effect of the KD and LCD on gut microbiota in mice with colitis, we utilized 16S rDNA profiling. The KD-C and LCD-C groups had lower Chao1 and Shannon indices than the ND-C group (Fig. 5a, b), while unweighted PCoA analysis demonstrated a clear distinction between the three groups (Fig.
5c). A heatmap based on unweighted UniFrac distance demonstrated three sample clusters representing the KD-C, LCD-C, and ND-C groups, respectively (Fig.
5d). At the phylum level (Fig.
5e), there were significantly fewer Proteobacteria in the KD-C group than in the ND-C group but more in the LCD-C group, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for Verrucomicrobia. At the genus level (Fig. 5f, g), the gut microbiota of the KD-C and LCD-C groups were enriched with Akkermansia and Escherichia/Shigella, respectively. In addition, the relative abundance of Parasutteralla, Alloprevotella, Lactobacillus and Clostridium IV were decreased in both LCD-C and KD-C group as compared with ND-C group.

We also analyzed the microbiota present in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of mice with colitis, finding that the Shannon and Simpson indices were significantly lower in the LCD-C group than in the KD-C or ND-C groups (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Consistent with our findings in the intestinal feces, LEfSe analysis of microbiota in MLNs revealed that Akkermansia was enriched in the KD-C group while Escherichia/Shigella were enriched in the LCD-C group (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). Finally, KEGG pathway analysis suggested that the microbiota in the MLNs of the LCD-C group were involved in bacterial motility and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, while those in the KD-C group were involved in pentose and glucuronate interconversion, carbohydrate metabolism, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis (Fig.
5h).

To validate whether the effect of KD or LCD was dependent on gut microbiota, we performed FMT from mice fed with a KD, LCD, or ND into GF mice (FKD-C, FLCD-C, and FND-C). No FKD-C mice died during the experiment; however, two died in the FLCD-C group and one died in the FND-C group (Fig.
6a). The FLCD-C group lost weight significantly faster than the FKD-C and FND-C groups (Fig.
6b), while the FKD-C group had a longer colon and lower mucosal inflammation than the FND-C group and the FLCD-C group displayed the opposite pattern (Fig. 6c, d). In addition, the FKD-C and FLCD-C groups had lower and higher DAI scores than the FND-C group, respectively (Fig.
6e). Moreover, expression of the barrier-related molecules Occludin and ZO-1 were significantly higher and lower in the FKD-C and FLCD-C groups than in the FND-C group (Fig. 6f, g). Furthermore, the FKD-C group had more goblet cells than the FND-C group, whereas the FLCD-C group had fewer (Fig.
6h).

Next, we investigated whether FMT from diet-treated mice affected inflammatory responses or mucosal immunity. We found that serum LPS levels were lower in the FKD-C group and higher in the FLCD-C group compared to the FND-C group (Fig.
7a), while immunofluorescence indicated that the colonic epithelium of the FKD-C group was enriched with fewer RORγt+CD3− ILC3 cells than that of the FLCD-C and FND-C groups, most of which were concentrated in cryptopatches. (Fig. 7b, c). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that colon tissues from the FKD-C group displayed significantly lower IL-17α, IL-18, IL-22, and Ccl4 mRNA levels than the FND-C group, whereas the opposite was observed for the FLCD-C group (Fig.
7d). Fecal microbiota profiles confirmed significant differences between the genera present in the microbiota of all three recipient groups, including those affected by the KD (Akkermansia), LCD (Oscillibacter), and ND (Alloprevotella and Lactobacillus) that were still dominant in the FKD, FLCD, and FND groups, respectively (Fig.
7e). Detailed analysis revealed that the OTUs successfully transferred from ND microbiota accounted for 98.0% of the donor’s entire community, while those from KD and LCD microbiota accounted for 92% and 93%, respectively (Supplementary Table 3). Of the 80 most abundant OTUs in each microbiota type (88% of ND microbiota, 94% of KD microbiota, 93% of LCD microbiota), we verified that 68 KD OTUs and 72 LCD OTUs were detected in the recipient mice, whereas 78 ND OTUs were present (Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table 3). These results demonstrate that a significant proportion of OTUs successfully colonized the gut of recipient mice, validating the reliability of FMT.

In this study, we found that the KD and LCD changed the specific composition and function of gut microbiota and metabolites. After colitis induction, the KD significantly reduced inflammatory responses, protected intestinal barrier function, and reduced ILC3 production and the expression of related inflammatory cytokines, whereas the opposite effects were observed for the LCD. In addition, FMT revealed that the inhibitory effect of the KD in colitis was dependent on its modification of gut microbiota. Altogether, these findings highlight that KD could represent a promising dietary therapeutic strategy for treating IBD (Fig.
7f).

In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that FMT from donors with a KD confers microbiota benefits and relieves colitis in DSS-induced recipients. We found that diets play an important role in shaping gut microbiota and that a KD can produce ideal gut microbiota for promoting weight control and resisting inflammation. Although this study is based on murine models and clinical effects have not yet been verified in human trials, we believe that our results provide new avenues for dietary IBD therapies and inform the customization and design of bacterial consortia for microbiota-targeted dietary supplements in patients with IBD to prevent intestinal barrier deterioration.

The study design is illustrated in Fig.
1a and consisted of two parts. Firstly, thirty-four 10-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China, and were divided into three groups: KD (n = 10, KD contains 10% kcal protein, <1% kcal carbohydrate, and 89% kcal fat, FBSH Biotechnology Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China), LCD (n = 10, LCD contains 20% kcal protein, 10% kcal carbohydrate, and 70% kcal fat, FBSH Biotechnology Co. Ltd), and ND (n = 14, 18% kcal protein, 65% kcal carbohydrate, and 17% kcal fat). Mice were co-housed prior to starting the test diets to control for cage effects.45 Food intake was set at 11.9 kcal/day and decreased to 11.2 kcal/day after weight gain was observed during the first weeks of the study. Cross-sectional mice were always maintained on 11.2 kcal/day. A detailed description of diet composition is provided in Supplementary Table 4. After 16 weeks of dietary intervention, the mice were treated with or without 3% DSS for 1.5 weeks and defined as KD colitis (KD-C, n = 10), LCD colitis (LCD-C, n = 10), ND colitis (ND-C, n = 10), and ND (n = 4) groups.
