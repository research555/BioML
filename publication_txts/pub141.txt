Behçet’s Disease—Do Microbiomes and Genetics Collaborate in Pathogenesis?

Behçet’s disease (BD) is a multisystem autoinflammatory condition characterized by mucosal ulceration, breakdown of immune privilege sites and vasculitis. A genetic basis for BD has been described in genome-wide and validation studies. Similarly, dysbiosis of oral and gut microbiomes have been associated with BD. This review will describe links between genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding molecules involved in gut biology and changes seen in microbiome studies. A potential decrease in bacterial species producing short chain fatty acids linked to mutations in genes involved in their production suggests a potential therapy for BD.

Behçet’s Disease (BD) is a multisystem autoinflammatory disorder characterized by inflammation at mucosal surfaces and break down of barriers at privileged sites including the eye, brain and joint (1). Many of the mucosal surfaces involved in BD host a community of microorganisms, and collectively their genetic content is known as the microbiome. The largest and most diverse of these microbial communities reside in the gut and have been shown to be important in the development and regulation of the immune system (2). Changes in the gut microbiome, also known as dysbiosis, have been associated with many human diseases including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis (3–5). The gut microbiome has also been shown to modulate the efficacy of immunotherapies in cancer patients (6, 7).

Since the first description of the disease triad in the 1930s, infectious microbial agents have always been speculated to be involved in the pathogenesis of BD, however, so far, no single pathogenic etiology has been found. Recent studies have investigated the association between the composition of the microbiomes and BD, which may provide a useful insight to the role of the microbiome in the disease process.

The gut microbiome profile in BD was first reported by Consolandi and associates, whereby they compared the fecal microbiota of 22 patients with 16 age-matched cohabitating individuals. Recruiting healthy controls who lived in the same house as the BD patients is of particular importance as it is known that several factors contribute to variations in gut microbiota composition, including environmental factors, geographical location, diet, age and host genetics (6). There was significant reduction in the alpha diversity and depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Roseburia and Subdoligranulum genera, in the gut microbiome of BD patients compared to healthy controls ( Table 1 ). The short chain fatty acid (SCFA) profile, by chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), revealed a significant reduction of butyrate levels in fecal samples of BD patients. Butyrate is important in regulating the host immune system and is responsible for inhibiting intestinal pro-inflammatory cytokines and promoting T cell differentiation into a T regulatory cell (Treg) lineage. Thus, it can be hypothesized that the dysbiotic microbiota seen in BD patients could have an important role in the pathogenesis of BD, whereby a reduction in butyrate causes downstream effects of promoting immune-pathological T-effector responses, leading to gut inflammation (18). Interestingly, a similar pattern is seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and oral administration of butyrate in experimental IBD mice, has shown to enhance Treg differentiation and reduce colitis (8, 19).

The table shows the relative abundance of microbial species in the microbiota (gut and oral microbiota) of BD patients when compared to HCs. Bold = species or genera linked to T regulatory cells. Abbreviations: BD, Behçet’s Disease; HC, healthy control; FMF, Familial Mediterranean Fever; CD, Chron’s Disease CD; MS, Multiple Sclerosis, RAS, Recurrent aphthous ulcer.

The gut microbiome was compared in patients with BD uveitis to patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) and Crohn’s Disease (CD), both which have autoinflammatory processes, as well as healthy controls. In total seven patients with BD, 12 patients with FMF, 9 patients with CD and 16 healthy controls (HC) were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results showed that Veionellaceae, Succinivibrionaceae families and Succinivibrio and Mitsuokella genera were enriched in patients with BD compared to the other groups. The relevance to uveitis is not yet elucidated (15).

Oral ulceration is an important manifestation of BD and maintains a specific microbiome. To investigate the involvement of the oral microbiome in BD pathogenesis, Coit et al. collected stimulated saliva samples from 31 BD patients and 15 HCs, after 5 minutes of paraffin chewing, between 9-11am to address circadian rhythm of saliva secretion. Microbial DNA was isolated and sequencing revealed a significant difference in bacterial communities between the two cohorts. Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Alloprevotella were increased in BD patients, whilst Leptotrichia and Clostridiales were decreased compared to control samples. H. parainfluenzae, a gram-negative bacterium, is commonly linked to endocarditis, meningitis, septicaemia and gingival inflammation. While use of immunosuppressants (cyclosporin, azathioprine and prednisolone) had an impact on abundances of bacteria, there was no differences in bacterial communities between drug treatments (16).

In a recent study the oral microbiome in Mongolian patients with BD was compared to healthy controls. Saliva samples were obtained from 47 patients and 48 healthy individuals and the V3-V4 region of 16S RNA was amplified. Specifically, Prevotella, Veillonella, Streptococcus, and Haemophilus were the most abundant species in all samples However, three genera including, Akkermansia were significantly lower in patients compared to controls (20).

These studies support a possible role for gut or oral dysbiosis in BD. Common features such as the reduction in butyrate producing species can be found in most studies, although different bacterial species are reported in different studies. Despite the evidence of microbial dysbiosis in BD patients, it is difficult to ascertain whether such differences are causative or reactive in BD. This is due to many confounding factors that could affect the microbiome including the type and duration of drug treatment, sampling and sequencing methodology, or host genetics. This could also be linked to the different manifestations of BD, which could only be addressed through large longitudinal studies.

There is increasing evidence that the host genetic background shapes the gut microbiome profile (23, 24).

There are more than 20 genetic susceptibility loci that meet the threshold for genome-wide level of significance in patients with Behçet’s disease and several other loci that have been associated with BD (25). To address the potential role of genetics in BD gut dysbiosis we have selected a potential pathway associated with production of SCFA in the gut and mutations in the genes involved. Activation of Toll-like receptors on systemic dendritic cells induces the release of IL-23, which activates innate lymphoid cells to release IL-22 which leads to a rapid α (1,2)-fucosylation of small intestine epithelial cells via the release of fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2). Fucosylated proteins enter into the lumen of the gut where they release fucose molecules which are metabolized by bacteria present. As stated, products from these bacteria include short chain fatty acids, including butyrate which supports T regulatory cells (26). This complex series of interactions involve several of the gene mutations in which have been associated with BD.

Toll-like receptors (TLR) are a family of transmembrane sensors for bacteria, fungi and viruses that are a vital component of innate immunity. The strongest associations between TLR and BD is in with TLR4 which recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms previously detected in TLR4 by direct sequencing were analyzed for an association with BD in Korean patients. The most frequent haplotype, TAGCGGTAA, was significantly increased in HLA-B*51-positive patients compared with healthy control participants and potential linked to joint disease (27). This was supported by targeted exonic resequencing of specific genes identified in the original GWAS, from 2,461 BD cases compared with 2,458 controls where a SNP in TLR4 was significantly associated with BD (28). In buccal lesions from patients with BD, TLR expression was increased compared with healthy controls, however, a similar increase was seen in lesion tissue from patients with lichen planus or gingivitis, suggesting that this was a generalized inflammatory response as opposed to a BD-specific response. In these patients no significant associations were seen with TLR4, but a gain of function mutation in the TLR adaptor molecule, TIR-adaptor protein (TIRAP) was significantly associated with BD in UK, but not Middle Eastern, patients (29). This mutation is associated with an more potent cytokine response to TLR stimulation.

These data support a role for bacterial sensing in BD.

Two major GWAS studies in Turkish and Japanese patients with BD identified SNP at the IL23R-IL12RB2 locus (rs924080 and rs12119179) respectively. Meta-analysis of both data sets further identified rs1495965 as associated with BD (33, 34). These associations have been supported in several other studies in different patient cohorts (35–39). These mutations have been linked to enhanced expression of IL-23R and potential upregulation of the IL-17 pathway.

In support of treatment altering the Th17 pathway, twenty-seven patients who received interferon alfa-2a for active BD uveitis and Treg and Th17 cells were assessed. Treg, Th17 cell frequencies and Th17 RORγt expression were significantly elevated, although IL-10 concentration in Treg culture supernatants was significantly lower with cells from BD patients compared to controls. IFN alfa-2a treatment led to clinical remission in 70% of patients which correlated with a significant reversal in Treg and Th17 cell frequencies, Treg IL-10 and Th17 cytokine production (41).

IL-22 is a member of the IL-10 cytokine family that is involved in inflammatory processes. Th22-type T cell clones from ocular samples taken from Behçet’s disease patients with active uveitis, produced IL-22 and TNF-a but not IFN-γ or IL-17. IL-22 can affect epithelial and stromal cells and has been involved the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin disorders, such as psoriasis, atopic eczema, and allergic contact dermatitis (42). Healthy IL-22-deficient mice had altered microbiome, with decreased abundance of Lactobacillus, and increased levels of others. Induction of experimental colitis caused more sever disease in deficient mice compared to controls. When the microbiome from IL-22 deficient mice was transmitted to wild-type animals along this led to an increased susceptibility to colitis, suggesting an important role for IL-22 the balance between immunity and colonic microbiota (43). Therefore, although no polymorphisms in IL22 have been reported in BD, a potential role in pathogenesis is likely.

Genome-wide array analysis of Iranian patients with BD and controls identified an association with five coding polymorphisms of the gene encoding fucosyltransferase -2 (FUT2), including the rs601338 nonsense variant which, in Caucasians, determines the secretion of the H antigen (precursor of the ABO blood group antigens) in body fluids and on the intestinal mucosa. These results were validated by comparison with GWAS analysis of Turkish patients with BD. A non-secretor phenotype is suggested to link with intestinal glycosylation (44). The association with FUT2 polymorphisms and BD was supported in an larger study of three populations. The rs601338 A allele, in Turkish and Iranian patients and the rs1047781 T allele in Japanese patients for which homozygosity leads to an ABO non-secretor phenotype were confirmed in this study. These non-secretor genotypes are also associated with Crohn’s disease risk (45).

Taken together polymorphisms in all genes encoding proteins in the pathway TLR-IL-23-IL-22- FUT2 have all been reported in patients with BD. Systemic activation of this pathway could lead to a reduction in beneficial SCFA either by increased targeting of SCFA-producing species or via reduced fucosylation and SCFA generation. This is one potential pathway initiated by systemic activation of tissue dendritic cells. The best direct evidence of cause and effect remains the induction of uveitis in B10RIII mice following transplantation of fecal material from patients with active BD (11). However, it is not known what induced the changes in the microbiome of these patients nor what processes drove ocular inflammation even in this genetically susceptible mouse model.

A possible link between gut and oral microbiome dysbiosis is supported by several studies and the involvement of the FUT2 pathway and gene polymorphisms in molecules involved may be relevant. However, there are several aspects that must be addressed. First, that different bacterial species and genera have been identified in the different studies. While there may be a commonality in decreased abundance of species linked to short chain fatty acid regulation that could link the studies more work needs to be done in larger cohorts with the same collection and preparation procedures. Second, certain demographic analysis does not support a link between manifestations of BD form example ocular involvement not associated with intestinal BD (13). Thirdly, many patients with BD do not have intestinal-BD, therefore there is no direct association between gut inflammation, the microbiome and other manifestations of BD. Fourth, several other sites affected by BD including oral and genital mucosa and skin harbor their own microbiome, which will need to be analyzed for association with manifestations of BD. Fifth, there is a significant non-genetic component in Behçet’s Disease. As stated, the MAMBA study (22) will address dietary influences on the gut microbiome. Recently the numbers of new patients being diagnosed with BD in Japan and Korea have been steadily decreasing (50, 51). Whether such changes involve factors such as a move to a more westernized diet would be interesting to address. Effects of different treatment regimes on the gut microbiome should be investigated. Finally, there are other gene loci that have been associated with BD that could impact on the composition of or the response to the gut microbiome, including HLA-B*51 and IL-10 and cells such as natural killer cells which can produce IL-10 when stimulated. Moreover, IL-10 production by Treg has been linked to Akkermansia which is altered in several studies.

In conclusion, while it is clear that dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is associated with Behçet’s disease and a role for known genetic mutations can be linked to these changes ( Figure 1 ), further research is required to understand the combinations involved in the manifestations of this complex disease.
