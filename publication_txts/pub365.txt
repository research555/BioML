Genetically Predicted Causality of 28 Gut Microbiome Families and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Risk



Mounting evidence indicates that gut microbiome may be involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, there is no consensus on whether there is a causal link between gut microbiome and T2DM risk. In the present study, the Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to investigate whether gut microbiome was causally linked to T2DM risk. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were significantly related to exposure from published available genome-wide association study (GWAS) were selected as instrumental variables (IVs). The robust methods including inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR Egger, and weighted median were conducted to infer the causal links. Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) and MR-Egger regression were used to test whether there was horizontal pleiotropy and identify outlier SNPs. The estimates of IVW suggested that Streptococcaceae (odds ratio (OR) = 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04–1.31, p = 0.009) was associated with higher risk of T2DM in European population. In Asian population, the MR IVW estimates revealed that there was a causal link between Acidaminococcaceae and T2DM risk (OR = 1.17, 95% CI, 1.04–1.31, p = 0.008). There was no evidence of notable heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. However, after false discovery rate (FDR) correction, the causal link between gut microbiome and T2DM was absent (FDR, p > 0.05). In summary, using genetic instruments, this study does not find evidence of association between the 28 gut microbiome families and T2DM risk. However, Streptococcaceae and Acidaminococcaceae may have a borderline positive correlation with T2DM risk.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction, which occurs mostly in middle-aged or elderly individuals (1). As a major component of the global disease burden, the prevalence of T2DM is increasing (2). It is estimated that by 2040, there will be 642 million adults worldwide with diabetes, and most of which are T2DM (3). The development of T2DM is mainly triggered by genetic factors and unhealthy lifestyle. Obesity is the primary predictor of T2DM which is responsible for more than half of diabetes cases (4). T2DM is a lifelong disease, and there is no cure. Mounting evidence suggests that gut microbiome may be involved in the pathogenesis of T2DM (5, 6).

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a commonly used approach to uncover the causal link between exposure and outcome (15), in which the genetic variations that are significantly related to exposure serve as instrumental variables (IVs). Being different from traditional observational studies, MR approach can minimize the influence of the confounding factors and reverse causation on the outcome (16). In the present study, the large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary-level data were used to perform two-sample MR analysis to infer the causality of gut microbiome composition and T2DM risk.

The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that served as IVs were from the latest GWAS, involving 18,473 subjects, which explore the influence of host genetics on the gut microbiome composition (17). The corresponding summary-level genetic data of T2DM risk were derived from a large GWAS involving 77,418 T2DM cases and 356,122 healthy controls of East Asian individuals (18). For the analysis of the European ancestry, the data of T2DM were obtained from a meta-analysis of GWAS with 62,892 T2DM cases and 596,424 controls (19). The corresponding information of SNPs was abstracted, including effect allele, other allele, effect size, standard error, and p-value.

These selected IVs must meet the following three core assumptions. Firstly, IVs are significantly correlated with exposure which means that the variants of interest can predict exposure effectively. In the present study, F statistic was performed to confirm whether the estimates were affected by weak IVs. F statistic is expressed as R 2(n-k-1)/k(1-R 2) where R 2 represents the estimated variance of exposure explained by the selected IVs, k is the number of IVs, and n refers to the sample size. Secondly, the IVs have to be independent of the outcome, namely the IVs can only affect outcome through exposure. Herein, MR-Egger regression and Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) were used to confirm whether there was horizontal pleiotropy between IVs and outcome. Thirdly, the IVs must be independent of the confounding factors associated with exposure or outcome.

The GWAS summary-level data were merged to infer the causal link between gut microbiome composition and T2DM risk. In the present study, the robust methods including inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR Egger, and weighted median were conducted to infer the causal links. IVW is a traditional method that merges the Wald ratio estimates of each IV in a meta-analysis manner (21). IVW equates to implement a weighted linear regression of the associations of the IVs with the outcome on the IVs with the exposure and intercept is constrained to zero (16). In the absence of horizontal pleiotropy, IVW enables to obtain unbiased estimates (22). MR Egger takes into account the pleiotropic effects, and the causal estimates represent the dose-response relationship between the genotype and outcome (23). When the Instrument Strength Independent of Direct Effect (InSIDE) hypothesis holds, MR Egger can get consistent causal effect estimates. Weighted median method allows some genetic variants are invalid, but only if at least half of them are valid instruments (24).

The MR-Egger regression and MR-PRESSO were used to confirm whether there was horizontal pleiotropy. MR-Egger regression has the property that confirms the pleiotropy between genetic instruments and outcome, and p-value greater than 0.05 was regarded as no horizontal pleiotropy. However, MR-Egger regression has lower precision and statistical power. MR-PRESSO can detect horizontal pleiotropy and identify pleiotropic outliers (25). If there was horizontal pleiotropy, the analyses were repeated after removing these pleiotropic SNPs. Heterogeneity between genetic instruments was quantified by Cochran Q statistic. Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was used to test whether the overall estimates were affected by strongly influencing SNPs. In addition, the Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to correct the false-discovery rate (FDR) for multiple tests. The statistical analyses were conducted by TwoSampleMR (26) and MRPRESSO (25) packages in R (version 4.0.3).

Initially, SNPs that were significantly related to the 28 gut microbiome families were selected. When excluding SNPs that with LD and were absent in the outcome GWAS, the remained variables of interest were selected as potential IVs. The detailed information of the selected IVs is shown in Supplementary Tables 1, 2 .

The estimates of IVW indicated that genetically predicted Streptococcaceae (odds ratio (OR) = 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04–1.31, p = 0.009) was positively related to T2DM risk ( Table 1 ; Figure 1 ). However, MR Egger and weighted median found no evidence of the association between exposure and outcome. The Q statistic showed that there was no notable heterogeneity (p = 0.270). MR-Egger regression and MR-PRESSO analysis further suggested no horizontal pleiotropy (p = 0.492 and p = 0.331, respectively). The results of MR-PRESSO analyses found evidence for significant horizontal pleiotropy between the IVs of Christensenellaceae (p = 0.004), Enterobacteriaceae (p = 0.041), Methanobacteriaceae (p = 0.046), Peptostreptococcaceae (p = 0.043), and Verrucomicrobiaceae (p = 0.020) and outcome. The causal effect estimates were recalculated after removing the outlier SNPs, and the results did not change substantially, except for Methanobacteriaceae (OR = 0.93, 95% CI, 0.88–0.99, p = 0.029). Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed that there were two strongly influencing SNPs (rs17791387, rs186073) in the IVs of Desulfovibrionaceae and one strongly influencing SNP (rs11123059) in the IVs of Methanobacteriaceae ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). After removing the strongly influencing SNPs, the results changed significantly (Desulfovibrionaceae: OR = 1.18, 95% CI, 1.07–1.30, p = 0.001; Methanobacteriaceae: OR = 0.93, 95% CI, 0.88–0.99, p = 0.029). The detailed results are shown in Supplementary Table 3 .

The results of IVW indicated that Acidaminococcaceae (OR = 1.17, 95% CI, 1.04–1.31, p = 0.008) was the risk factor for T2DM ( Table 1 ; Figure 2 ). There was no evidence of notable heterogeneity (p = 0.751) across instrument SNP effects. MR-Egger regression showed that there was no horizontal pleiotropy between the variants of interest and outcome (p = 0.593). However, there were not enough SNPs for MR-PRESSO analysis. The results of MR-PRESSO suggested that there was significant horizontal pleiotropy of Bacteroidaceae (p = 0.014) and rs234027 was a pleiotropic SNP. In addition, MR-PRESSO detected two outliers (rs6060237 and rs7199026) in the analysis of Desulfovibrionaceae. After removal of these outliers, MR estimates remained null. In the sensitivity analysis, strongly influencing SNPs were identified in the IVs of Acidaminococcaceae (rs6589457), Alcaligenaceae (rs7638039), Clostridiaceae_1 (rs11752225 and rs6934446), Oxalobacteraceae (rs36018452), Rikenellaceae (rs2290844, rs4264350 and rs7832304), and Verrucomicrobiaceae (rs9349825) ( Supplementary Figure 2 ). Most results changed significantly after removing strongly influencing SNPs (Acidaminococcaceae: OR = 1.09, 95% CI, 0.89–1.34, p = 0.399; Alcaligenaceae: OR = 0.89, 95% CI, 0.81–0.98, p = 0.018; Clostridiaceae_1: OR = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.74–0.93, p = 0.001; Oxalobacteraceae: OR = 1.07, 95% CI, 1.01–1.13, p = 0.024; Rikenellaceae: OR = 0.90, 95% CI, 0.84–0.96, p = 0.002; Verrucomicrobiaceae: OR = 1.10, 95% CI, 1.00–1.21, p = 0.042). However, after FDR correction, the causal effect between gut microbiome and T2DM was absent (FDR p > 0.05). The detailed results are shown in Supplementary Table 4 .

The inverse MR was conducted to explore whether there was causal link between T2DM and gut microbiome. SNPs (p < 5 × 10−8) significantly associated with T2DM risk were used as IVs ( Supplementary Tables 5, 6 ). For European, the IVW estimates showed that T2DM was related to a decrease in the abundance of Bacteroidaceae (OR = 0.97, 95% CI, 0.94–0.99, P = 0.042) and Oxalobacteraceae (OR = 0.94, 95% CI, 0.88–0.99, p = 0.030). The results of MR-Egger regression and MR-PRESSO suggested that there was no significant horizontal pleiotropy. However, the results changed substantially after FDR correction. For Asian, the results of IVW indicated that T2DM was associated with reduced Oxalobacteraceae (OR = 0.94, 95% CI, 0.88–0.99, p = 0.036). There was no significant horizontal pleiotropy between IVs and outcome, but no evidence for genetic correlations of T2DM with gut microbiome after FDR correction. Exact values are listed in Supplementary Tables 7, 8 .

In the present study, the published available GWAS summary-level data were used to perform two-sample MR. The results revealed that genetically predicted level of some gut microbiome families was causally related to T2DM risk. However, there was no evidence for genetic correlation of the abundance of gut microbiome with T2DM after FDR correction.

In summary, the study is leveraging MR to find that there is no evidence of the association between the 28 gut microbiome families and T2DM risk. However, in view of the biological plausibility, further studies are needed to explore the relationship between gut microbiome and the risk of T2DM, which is conducive to exploring the pathogenesis of diabetes.
