Assessing the effect of interaction between gut microbiome and inflammatory bowel disease on the risks of depression



Gut microbiome and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are implicated in the development of depression, but the effect of their interactions on the risk of depression remains unclear. We aim to analyze the effect of interactions between gut microbiome and IBD on the risk of depression, and explore candidate genes involving the interactions.

Using the individual genotype and depression traits data from the UK Biobank, we calculated the polygenetic risk scores (PRS) of 114 gut microbiome, ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and total IBD (CD + UC) respectively. The effects of interactions between gut microbiome and IBD on depression were assessed through a linear regression model. Moreover, for observed significant interactions between gut microbiome PRS and IBD PRS, PLINK software was used to test pair-wise single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) interaction of corresponding gut microbiome PRS and IBD PRS on depression.

We found 64 candidate interactions between gut microbiome and IBD on four phenotypes of depression, such as F_Lachnospiraceae (RNT) × (CD + UC) for patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score (P = 1.48 × 10−3), F_Veillonellaceae (HB) × UC for self-reported depression (P = 2.83 × 10−3) and P_Firmicutes (RNT) × CD for age at first episode of depression (P = 8.50 × 10−3). We observed interactions of gut-microbiome-associated SNPs × IBD-associated SNPs, such as G_Alloprevotella (HB)-associated rs147650986 (GPM6A) × IBD-associated rs114471990 (QRICH1) (P = 2.26 × 10−4).

Our results support the effects of interactions between gut microbiome and IBD on depression risk, and reported several novel candidate genes for depression.

Depression is a common mental illness characterized by persistent low mood and diminished interest (Chand et al., 2021). The prevalence of depression has increased over the past few decades. It is estimated that 322 million people are suffering from depression, and the World Health Organization has identified it as one of the most significant contributors to global disability (Moreno-Agostino et al., 2021). Depression also seriously affects the life and employment of patients and brings heavy burdens to their families and society (Malhi and Mann, 2018).

In this study, we calculated the PRS for gut microbiome and IBD using published GWAS datasets, and subsequently applied linear regression models to assess the effect of interactions between gut microbiome PRS and IBD PRS on the risk of depression. Finally, for the top 10 gut microbiome PRS × IBD PRS interactions, the PLINK software was used to perform SNPs interactions analysis. We aim to analyze the association between gut microbiome × IBD interactions and depression, and further explore the corresponding genetic mechanisms underlying depression.

This study used the genotype and phenotype data from the UK Biobank prospective cohort (Application 46478), which collected genome-wide data and health-related information from approximately 500,000 individuals aged 40–69 from all over the UK in 2006–2010 (Bycroft et al., 2018). The information of participants was collected through self-completed touch-screen questionnaires, computer-assisted interviews, and anthropometric measurements. All participants signed an electronic consent and allowed the UK Biobank to access their health-related records and agreed to use their anonymous data and samples in any health-related research (Sudlow et al., 2015).

In this study, we defined four depression phenotypes. The phenotype of patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score was measured according to the PHQ-9 (Davis et al., 2019). PHQ-9 is a classification algorithm with a total score of 0–27 that focuses on nine signs and symptoms of depression (Kroenke et al., 2010). Self-reported depression was defined based on self-reported disease status in the UK Biobank (Davis et al., 2019). Age at first episode of depression was defined based on the age at which participants first experienced depressive symptoms for two weeks or more. Depression possibly related to childbirth was defined by the presence of depressive symptoms within months of giving birth or post-natal depression. The detailed definitions are provided in the Supplementary materials.

The UK Biobank cohort included genotypic data for 488,377 participants (Bycroft et al., 2018). Genotyping was performed by two very similar genotyping arrays, the UK BiLEVE Axiom array and the UK Biobank Axiom array (Bycroft et al., 2018). Imputation was carried out with the IMPUTE4 program, and the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) and UK10K and 1000 Genomes phase 3 as imputation reference panels (McCarthy et al., 2016; UK 10K Consortium et al., 2015). Quality control (QC) included two parts: mark-based quality control and sample-based quality control (Bycroft et al., 2018). Briefly, statistical tests for batch effects, plate effects, departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, sex effects, array effects, and discordance across control replicates were performed to identify poor-quality markers. Poor-quality samples were detected using deletion rates and heterozygosity calculations. For sex chromosomes, specific quality controls were performed using 15,766 high-quality markers on the X and Y chromosomes. Principal components (PCs) were calculated by the UK Biobank from genome-wide genotypic data and could be representative of an individual's ethnic background (Bycroft et al., 2018). FastPCA (Galinsky et al., 2016) was applied to calculate PCs using a set of 407,219 unrelated, high-quality samples and 147,604 high-quality SNPs. Individuals with similar principal component scores have similar self-reported ethnic backgrounds (Bycroft et al., 2018). For example, the first two principal components separate out individuals with sub-Saharan African ancestry, European ancestry and East Asian ancestry (Bycroft et al., 2018). In this study, we chose the first 10 PCs as covariates because they can explain sufficient ancestry genetic characteristics for the UK Biobank participants (Frank et al., 2020). Detailed information about genotyping, imputation and QC could be found in the published study (Bycroft et al., 2018).

The gut microbiome GWAS data were derived from a large-scale study, which performed genomic analysis on 2,223 individuals from Flemish Gut Flora Project (FGFP) cohort (Hughes et al., 2020). In brief, DNA was extracted from the collected fecal samples, and was sequenced after amplifying the V4 region of 16rRNA. A total of 499 taxa were counted, 139 of which met the standards of association analysis, and 92 taxa were finally analyzed after removing the correlation coefficients greater than 0.985. Genotyping was performed on two different arrays of Human Core Exome v1.0 and v1.1. Microbial taxa were described as relative abundance curves using the rank normal transformed (RNT) model, whereas those taxa with zero abundance distribution were described using the hurdle binary (HB) model. The α-diversity, abundance, and presence/absence correlation of microbiome were analyzed using snptest.2.5.0. Finally, 3,321 linkage disequilibrium (LD) independent loci were identified to be associated with 16S gut microbiome phenotypes. In our study, we selected SNPs loci with P < 1.0 × 10−4 for subsequent PRS analysis, and finally calculated the PRS of 114 gut-microbiome-associated traits. Detailed information about the human gut microbiome GWAS has been published in previous study (Hughes et al., 2020).

The IBD GWAS summary data were derived from subjects recruited at the outpatient IBD clinic of the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium (Vancamelbeke et al., 2017). Briefly, 1,696 patients with CD, 884 patients with UC and 849 controls were genotyped by Immunochip. SNPs located within 50 kb up- or downstream of the transcription start/end site were extracted, and highly correlated SNPs (SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium, r2 > 0.7) were excluded. Finally, correlated SNPs were identified and used for PRS calculation. Detailed information of genetic data for IBD was described in the published study (Vancamelbeke et al., 2017).

We calculated gut microbiome PRS and IBD PRS using GWAS data from gut microbiome and IBD and genotype data from UK Biobank cohort. The PRS was calculated by PLINK2.0 (Purcell et al., 2007; Lewis and Vassos, 2020). Let PRSn denote the PRS value of gut microbiome for the nth subject, defined as:

The linear regression model was developed using R software to evaluate the effects of interactions between gut microbiome PRS and IBD PRS on the depression phenotypes.

Age, sex, townsend deprivation index (TDI), smoking frequency daily, alcohol frequency weekly and top 10 PCs of population structure were set as covariates in the analysis of PHQ-9 score, self-reported depression, and age at first episode of depression. The analysis for depression possibly related to childbirth was only conducted in females, and age, TDI, smoking frequency daily, alcohol frequency weekly and top 10 PCs were set as covariates. Furthermore, we performed subgroup analysis by sex and age respectively. For the age subgroup analysis, we divided the subjects into three age groups: youth group (<50 years old), middle-aged group (50–59 years old) and elderly group (≥60 years old), and age was not set as a covariate. For the sex subgroup analysis, sex was not set as a covariate. In this study, the significant threshold was set as P = 0.05.

According to the results of PRS, the top 10 significant interactions of gut microbiome PRS × IBD PRS were further selected for SNP × SNP interactions analysis. The “epistasis” command of PLINK was used to test the interactions of gut-microbiome-associated SNPs and IBD-associated SNPs, according to the regression model:

Totally, 84,805, 85,073, 43,664 and 26,696 individuals were included in analyses for PHQ-9 score, self-reported depression, age at first episode of depression and depression possibly related to childbirth, respectively. For depression possibly related to childbirth, the study samples were all females. The basic characteristics of study subjects are presented in Table 1.

Notes: PHQ: Patient Health Questionnaire. Age, Alcohol frequency weekly, Smoking frequency daily and Townsend deprivation index were described as Mean ± standard deviation.

Previous studies have revealed that gut microbiome and IBD involve in the development of depression (Barandouzi et al., 2020; Abautret-Daly et al., 2018). However, the biological mechanisms behind the impact of interactions between gut microbiome and IBD on depression risk remain to be elucidated. In this study, we examined the interactions between IBD and the gut microbiome, and then observed the effects of the interactions on depression risk. We also reported several novel candidate genes for depression through SNPs interaction analysis.

In conclusion, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to test the effect of gut microbiome × IBD on depression risk, and explore the potential role of SNPs interactions in the pathogenesis of depression. We detected multiple significant gut microbiome PRS × IBD PRS interactions and identified several candidate genes for depression. Our findings provide novel clues for the pathogenesis and therapy of depression. Further research is needed to elucidate and validate the biological mechanisms in the future.
