Structure and function of the healthy pre-adolescent pediatric gut microbiome

The gut microbiome influences myriad host functions, including nutrient acquisition, immune modulation, brain development, and behavior. Although human gut microbiota are recognized to change as we age, information regarding the structure and function of the gut microbiome during childhood is limited. Using 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we characterized the structure, function, and variation of the healthy pediatric gut microbiome in a cohort of school-aged, pre-adolescent children (ages 7–12 years). We compared the healthy pediatric gut microbiome with that of healthy adults previously recruited from the same region (Houston, TX, USA).

Although healthy children and adults harbored similar numbers of taxa and functional genes, their composition and functional potential differed significantly. Children were enriched in Bifidobacterium spp., Faecalibacterium spp., and members of the Lachnospiraceae, while adults harbored greater abundances of Bacteroides spp. From a functional perspective, significant differences were detected with respect to the relative abundances of genes involved in vitamin synthesis, amino acid degradation, oxidative phosphorylation, and triggering mucosal inflammation. Children’s gut communities were enriched in functions which may support ongoing development, while adult communities were enriched in functions associated with inflammation, obesity, and increased risk of adiposity.

Previous studies suggest that the human gut microbiome is relatively stable and adult-like after the first 1 to 3 years of life. Our results suggest that the healthy pediatric gut microbiome harbors compositional and functional qualities that differ from those of healthy adults and that the gut microbiome may undergo a more prolonged development than previously suspected.

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is home to one of the largest, most diverse human-associated bacterial communities. More than “fellow travelers,” our gut microbiota are essential to digestion and nutrient acquisition, intestinal development and motility, and modulation of the immune system [1–3]. Further, emerging research suggests that the gut microbiome may be intimately linked to brain development and behavior [4].

It is thought that childhood may provide opportunities for microbiome interventions to promote health or prevent disease [12]. As such, it is vital to establish a baseline understanding of pediatric GI microbiome structure and function, the degree to which these vary among healthy children, and the extent to which specific microbial features are unique to childhood, as opposed to infancy, when digestive function is immature [19, 20], or adulthood, when presumed to be mature. The goals of this study were to describe gut microbial composition and functional potential in healthy, pre-adolescent children and compare them with healthy adults. Thus, we compared matched 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic profiles of healthy children from Houston, TX, and adults recruited at the Human Microbiome Project’s (HMP) [21] Houston-based clinical site.

Thirty-seven healthy children were included in our 16S-based analysis, and a subset of these (n = 22) were analyzed via shotgun metagenomics (WGS). Stratifying the HMP for adults who fit our inclusion criteria provided 43 and 22 subjects for our 16S- and WGS-based analyses, respectively. Subject demographics are described in Additional file 1: Table S1, and sequence accession numbers and quality metrics are described in Additional file 2: Table S2, Additional file 3: Table S3, and Additional file 4: Table S4. Our pediatric cohort included one Asian and two subjects of mixed/unknown ancestry, limiting our analysis of race to black versus white.

We found that, as previously reported for healthy adults, the healthy, pediatric gut microbiome is composed largely of bacteria belonging to the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and the ratio of these two phyla varies considerably across subjects (Fig. 1a). In contrast to adults, the average healthy child’s gut community contains significantly lower abundances of Bacteroidetes and significantly greater abundances of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria (White’s non-parametric t-test, q < 0.01 for each). At the genus level, members of the Bacteroides accounted for nearly 40 % of the average healthy child’s gut microbiome, with Faecalibacterium, Alistipes, Ruminococcus, Roseburia, and other genera composing the balance (Fig. 1b). Although the average healthy child’s gut microbiome harbors a large variety of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), neither richness nor diversity (Additional file 5: Table S5) or overall community structure (Additional file 6: Figure S1A, C, D) varied significantly as a function of sex, ethnicity, or body mass index (BMI) status. Similarly, neither richness nor diversity differed according to race, but marginally significant differences (Adonis test, F = 1.59, p = 0.05) were detected with respect to race and variation in community structure among children (Additional file 6: Figure S1B), as well as in a combined analysis of children and adults (Additional file 7: Figure S2C).

Random Forests analysis further validated the differentiation of child and adult gut communities. With an out-of-bag error rate of 15 % (versus a baseline error rate of 46 %), a subset of OTUs which correctly classified most subjects (68 of 80) was identified. Misclassification was not explained by known subject variables; these subjects included individuals from both sexes, all BMI classes, and multiple races, ethnicities, and subject ages. OTUs contributing to the differentiation of gut communities, according to their Random Forests importance scores, included members of the genera Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Bacteroides (Table 1).

MetaPhlAn profiling of WGS libraries was used to generate genus- and species-level profiles of our healthy gut communities. Despite differences inherent between the 16S- and WGS-based approaches, we found broad agreement between the two techniques with respect to microbiome composition and its relationship with clinical variables, including age (e.g., Figs. 1b, c and 2a, b; Additional file 6: Figure S1A–H). On average, 16S and WGS libraries from the same individual shared >70 % concordance with respect to genus-level relative abundances (n = 44 paired specimens, average Pearson r = 0.71), and in many cases, these values exceeded 90 %. Similar taxa were differentially abundant between groups (Additional file 9: Table S7 and Additional file 11: Table S8), and age consistently explained a greater proportion of the variation than other known variables (Fig. 2a, b; Additional file 7: Figure S2A-H).

Within- and between-group dissimilarities of WGS-based species profiles also suggest that the gut communities of children share a significantly greater degree of similarity (i.e., less dissimilarity) with one another than they do with those of adults (Student’s t-test with 1000 permutations, Bonferroni correction, p < 0.05, Fig. 2c). As with 16S, Random Forests analysis of the WGS-based species profiles correctly classified the majority of subjects by age group. With an overall error rate of 13.64 % (versus a baseline error rate of 50 %), three children and three adults were misclassified. Species contributing to the differentiation of children and adults are provided in Table 1 and include members of many of the same genera identified in our 16S analysis.

A total of 5820 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) ortholog groups (KO) were detected among the 44 gut community profiles analyzed, and 46 % of these ortholog groups (2693 KO) were detected in all subjects. Gut communities of children were significantly enriched with respect to the average number of KO detected (Student’s two-tailed t-test, p = 0.02). The average healthy child’s gut metagenome contained 4446 KO, while the average adult’s contained 4201 KO.

At the pathway level, 163 KEGG pathways were detected among all profiles, and 70 % of these (114 pathways) were present in all subjects. Children shared 96 % similarity (median value, 4 % Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) with one another in terms of their KEGG pathway profiles, a level similar to that which is observed among healthy adults (median value, 95 % similarity) and between children and adults (median value, 95 % similarity). We found that neither pathway relative abundances nor overall variation with respect to functional profiles at the pathway level (Additional file 6: Figure S1M–P) differed significantly as a function of sex, race, or ethnicity among children. In contrast, we found that the relative abundances of 59 pathways differed between healthy children and adults (White’s non-parametric t-test, q < 0.10, Additional file 13: Table S10). These included pathways involved in amino acid metabolism, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, flagellar assembly, steroid hormone biosynthesis, RNA degradation, and oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 3b), and many provided high discriminatory value between the profiles of children and adults in a Random Forests analysis. Our classification error rate of 17.39 % (versus a baseline error rate of 50 %) suggests that KEGG pathway profiles can be used to distinguish the gut microbiomes of most healthy children and adults from one another.

Although it is recognized that the gut microbiome has the potential to change along with the development of its host, information regarding the structure and function of the gut microbiome in healthy children remains limited. Previous studies have focused mainly on bacterial composition in the context of diet and/or biogeography [15, 14], and these have relied heavily on 16S data. Likewise, other adult versus pediatric comparisons have emphasized the stark contrasts of infant and adult GI communities [15, 16] rather than the more subtle contrasts of adults versus older children, have been limited to a single family [22], or have included teenagers [15, 23], despite evidence of microbiome shifts at other body sites during puberty [24, 25].

Multiple gene families and functions associated with the gut microbiome affect the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory processes. Mirroring results described by Le Chatelier et al. [32], we found that the gut microbial communities of healthy children shared traits with those from “high gene count” (i.e., healthy) individuals and were significantly enriched or showed trends toward enrichment of functions associated with anti-inflammatory properties, including vitamin B12 synthesis (a key component of the KEGG pathway for porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism) and methane metabolism (Fig. 4b). In contrast, healthy adult gut communities shared many traits with “low gene count” individuals (i.e., those with low-grade inflammation and increased incidence of metabolic disorders [32]) and were significantly enriched in genes and gene families associated with inflammation and exposure to oxidative stress, including lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 4c). These results extend previous work [11] describing the gut microbial communities of younger adults as possessing fewer pro-inflammatory traits than those of older adults and suggest that healthy children fall even lower on the pro-inflammatory scale. Further, they imply that “inflammaging” [9, 45] may not be limited to the later adult years.

As with other developmental processes, childhood appears to represent a unique transitional stage with respect to the gut microbiome. Although the healthy pediatric gut microbiome harbors several adult-like features, it also retains many of its own distinct compositional and functional qualities. Such characteristics could contribute to age-adjusted definitions of the healthy gut microbiome, serve as diagnostic biomarkers to delineate life stage and direct appropriate medical treatment, and be important to consider in the development of microbiome-directed therapies, particularly those targeted toward microbiome restoration.

As previously described [46], healthy children (7–12 years of age) were recruited from a large healthcare network based in Houston, TX. Informed consent was obtained from parents and assent was obtained from children. All recruitment and study procedures were approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Exclusion criteria included, but were not limited to, abdominal pain with or without organic cause, recent major dietary changes, use of antibiotics within the prior month, probiotics within the past 6 months, and, in girls, menarche. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria and subject metadata are archived at dbGaP (accession phs000265.v3.p1).

Following a research study coordinator’s instructions, participants collected stool specimens at home. Samples were stored in a sterile cup, at −20 °C, until courier transfer to the Texas Children’s Microbiome Center. Upon receipt, samples were stored at −80 °C. DNA was extracted using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with modifications to the manufacturer’s protocol [27]. DNA quality and yield were evaluated via agarose gel, Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE, USA), and Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Both the 16S rRNA gene and WGS libraries were generated and sequenced by the Human Genome Sequencing Center (HGSC) at Baylor College of Medicine. The 16S libraries were generated using the V3-V5 (357F/926R) primer region [46, 47]. The WGS libraries were generated using 101-bp paired-end libraries with 200-bp inserts on the HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

Although the HMP recruited >240 participants, we specifically included those who were recruited at the HMP’s Houston-based clinical site and whose stool-based 16S sequence data were produced at the HGSC. This was done to limit the influence of potential sequencing-center-related biases [30, 47]. Likewise, emulation of DNA extraction and amplicon generation protocols was employed to minimize additional potential sources of bias. Forty-three HMP volunteers met the criteria described above and were included in our analysis. Stool WGS sequence data were available for 22 of the participants described above, and their WGS libraries were utilized regardless of where the data were produced. Sequence data were obtained from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive [PRJNA43017, PRJNA48479], and metadata were obtained from dbGaP [phs000228].

The 16S rRNA sequence libraries were sorted by barcode and quality filtered using the Genboree Microbiome Toolset [48]. Sequences shorter than 200 bp, having average quality scores <20, including ambiguous base calls, or containing mismatches to barcode or sequencing primer were removed. After trimming barcodes and primers, all remaining reads were clustered into OTUs at a 97 % similarity threshold using QIIME (v1.3.0) [49]. OTUs were clustered using CD-Hit [50], and reads were screened for chimeras using ChimeraSlayer [51]. Potential chimeras were excluded from further analysis. OTU identities were assigned using the Ribosomal Database Project Classifier [52] with RDP training set 9 and confidence scores ≥50 %.

The data sets supporting the results of this article are available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive [PRJNA46339, PRJNA43017, PRJNA48479] and dbGAP [phs000228, phs000265.v3.p1].
