Oral–Gut Microbiota and Arthritis: Is There an Evidence-Based Axis?

The gut microbiome appears to be a significant contributor to musculoskeletal health and disease. Recently, it has been found that oral microbiota are involved in arthritis pathogenesis. Microbiome composition and its functional implications have been associated with the prevention of bone loss and/or reducing fracture risk. The link between gut–oral microbiota and joint inflammation in animal models of arthritis has been established, and it is now receiving increasing attention in human studies. Recent papers have demonstrated substantial alterations in the gut and oral microbiota in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). These alterations resemble those established in systemic inflammatory conditions (inflammatory bowel disease, spondyloarthritides, and psoriasis), which include decreased microbial diversity and a disturbance of immunoregulatory properties. An association between abundance of oral Porphyromonas gingivalis and intestinal Prevotella copri in RA patients compared to healthy controls has been clearly demonstrated. These new findings open important future horizons both for understanding disease pathophysiology and for developing novel biomarkers and treatment strategies. The changes and decreased diversity of oral and gut microbiota seem to play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of RA and OA. However, specific microbial clusters and biomarkers belonging to oral and gut microbiota need to be further investigated to highlight the mechanisms related to alterations in bones and joints inflammatory pathway.

Homo sapiens is more prokaryotic than eukaryotic, as the bacteria “layed” in the internal mucosae (intestinal tract, reproductive organs, and respiratory tract) and externally in the body (skin and hair) outnumber host cells 10 to 1 [1]. This paradigm shift has been prompted by the advent of high-throughput metagenomic approaches and has definitively changed the way we study human microbial ecosystems and their interactions with the host. Microbes present in these biological systems are deeply integrated in our daily life, and emerging research has sought to decipher this complex inter-kingdom communication network present in our body and immune system. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract has the highest density and variety of microorganisms (more than 100 trillion microbes and approximately 1500 species). Early life host–microbe interactions, especially in the gut, drive the development of immunity and the establishment of a stable complex microbial community, commonly referred to as the commensal microbiota [2,3]. Extensive research has focused on gut microbiota and host immune response effects in the context of protection against pathogenic gut microbes and the pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory/autoimmune disease states [4,5]. For example, it has been reported that in patients with Crohn’s disease, there is a relationship between dysbiosis and response to treatment. Hence, microbiota could be a target of the treatment of chronic intestinal diseases [6].

The present review aims to address the most recent findings regarding the oral and gut microbiomes and their relationship with RA and OA, respectively.

RA is an autoimmune disease affecting the synovium and cartilage with bony erosion. Recently, the relationship between the oral microbiome and systemic diseases has been explored [21,22]. Sher et al. demonstrated that overall exposure to Porphyromonas gingivalis was similar between patients with RA and controls. These authors found an abundance of Anaeroglobus geminatus that correlates with the presence of rheumatoid factors, and Prevotella and Leptotrichia species are the only taxa that have been observed in patients with new-onset RA [22].

As mentioned, a clear correlation between bacteria and OA can also be seen by studying the profile of the oral cavity. Oral microbiota seem to have a particular value in OA as well as in the differentiation of RA. Despite these challenging results, more in-depth studies are needed to explore the differences in the oral microbiome profiles of patients with OA. Next-generation sequencing may be a useful tool to further investigate how oral bacteria can affect this type of arthritis.

The hypothesis that not only oral but also intestinal microbiota can be associated with the development of RA is supported by many data. Zhang et al. published a case-control metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) of the fecal, dental and salivary microbiomes of a cohort of treatment-naive and treated RA patients. They found that the RA-associated microbiome deviated significantly from healthy controls in all sites [28]. In this study, Haemophilus spp. was depleted in individuals with RA at the fecal and oral levels, whereas Lactobacillus salivarius was over-represented in individuals with RA at both microbiota sites.

The exact role of gut microbiota’s involvement in the pathophysiology of OA remains under investigation; all these aforementioned observations raise the possibility that the microbiome or part of it may mediate the effects and outcome of this highly prevalent and widespread disease.

The first description of the possible involvement of microbiota in the pathology of arthritis was published in 1970s when rats raised in germ-free conditions developed severe joint inflammation with 100% penetrance in an adjuvant-induced arthritis model, while conventionally raised controls showed only mild disease at a very low incidence [56].

There is a justified association between oral and gut microbiomes in arthritis, although the current evidence that the microbiome causes arthritis is far from conclusive. Strategic future studies aiming to improve the understanding of the combined role of gut–oral axis in arthritis as well as the use of “microbiome influencers,” such as the probiotics, are mandatory.
