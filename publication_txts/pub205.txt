Diet Supplementation with Fish-Derived Extracts Suppresses Diabetes and Modulates Intestinal Microbiome in a Murine Model of Diet-Induced Obesity

Metabolic syndrome-related diseases affect millions of people worldwide. It is well established that changes in nutritional habits and lifestyle can improve or prevent metabolic-related pathologies such as type-2 diabetes and obesity. Previous reports have shown that nutritional supplements have the capacity to limit glucose intolerance and suppress diabetes development. In this study, we investigated the effect of dietary supplementation with fish-derived extracts on obesity and type 2 diabetes and their impact on gut microbial composition. We showed that nutritional supplements containing Fish Complex (FC), Fish Complex combined with Cod Powder (FC + CP), or Cod Powder combined with Collagen (CP + C) improved glucose intolerance, independent of abdominal fat accumulation, in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes. In addition, collagen-containing supplements distinctly modulate the gut microbiome in high-fat induced obesity in mice. Our results suggest that fish-derived supplements suppress diet-induced type 2 diabetes, which may be partly mediated through changes in the gut microbiome. Thus, fish-derived supplements and particularly the ones containing fish collagen have potential beneficial properties as dietary supplements in managing type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome via modulation of the gut microbiome.

Obesity and insulin resistance are central traits of the metabolic syndrome and contribute to serious, yet alarmingly frequent pathologies, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease [1,2]. Based on the World Health Organization’s official statistics, in 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults were overweight, of whom 650 million were obese. Obesity is defined as the abnormal or excessive fat accumulation which poses a risk to health, whereas insulin resistance is the inability of the body to utilize insulin efficiently [3]. In many cases, both are caused by lifestyle behaviors and, thus, are preventable. More specifically, dietary habits such as excess calorie or processed food consumption, and, importantly, lack of sufficient physical activity are fundamental to shaping these two detrimental conditions [4,5,6]. Other risk factors may include genetic predisposition, chronic inflammation, alcohol consumption, stress, age, medications, diseases, disturbed circadian rhythm, and microbiome content [1,2,7].

Different animal models exist in order to study the effect of diet supplementation on obesity and type 2 diabetes, of which broadly used are diet-induced obesity models [23]. In the present study, a murine model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes was utilized to examine the effects of fish-derived nutritional supplements on obesity and diabetes and determine changes in the gut microbiome.

In order to investigate the potential beneficial role of fish supplements (Table 1) in high-fat induced obesity and insulin resistance, mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with 5% w/w of the respective supplement to be tested, for a period of 9 weeks. The 5% w/w supplementation was chosen as a sufficient simulation model for the average human supplement intake. Since fish supplements contain a substantial amount of protein, a 5% w/w soy protein supplemented diet was used as control to simulate a comparable protein intake. Detailed nutritional composition of supplemented diets is shown in Table S1.

When animals are on a high-fat diet, they rapidly gain weight. In order to examine whether the selected supplements have an effect on the animal weight gain, mice following a high-fat diet supplemented with fish extracts had their weight monitored twice a week for 9 weeks. Animals that were fed the FC supplement had a similar weight accumulation with the HFD-control group (Figure 1A). On the other hand, CP supplementation caused a significant increase (p < 0.001) in animal weight gain during weeks 6–8 of the experiment (Figure 1B). This increase may be due to the higher energy content of the CP supplement compared to the FC. Interestingly, when CP was combined with FC, the elevated weight gain due to the former was reversed and a lowering tendency could be noted (p < 0.01) (Figure 1C). This could indicate a synergistic effect between the two extracts or could be the result of the lower concentration (2.5% w/w) of the CP supplement that resulted in weight gain (Figure 1B). The combination of FC with collagen had no effect on the weight change (Figure 1A). However, when CP was mixed with collagen, the increased weight accumulation was ameliorated (Figure 1B). That could be attributed to a possible anti-obesity effect of collagen, as has been previously reported [17,19], or to the smaller CP concentration.

While adipose tissue was initially regarded as an energy storage depot, it is now considered to be an active endocrine organ which regulates a number of homeostatic processes, such as metabolism, inflammation and blood pressure, mainly through adipokine and cytokine production [25]. The adipokine leptin is known as the “satiety hormone”, which regulates energy balance by inhibiting hunger, and has an insulin-sensitizing effect, while its structure resembles pro-inflammatory cytokines [26]. Leptin levels in white adipose tissue reflect the size of energy stores, therefore they appear higher in obese individuals [27]. Indeed, the control diet-fed mice exhibited a considerably lower leptin gene expression compared to the HFD control group, whereas it is noteworthy that the leptin gene expression levels follow the pattern of the corresponding adipose tissue weight. Both the FC and the CP groups displayed an elevated expression of leptin (Figure 3B), which could be attributed to their high energy content, possibly resulting in elevated leptin to induce satiety. Our results showed that the FC supplement led to an improved glucose tolerance, whereas CP did not, while it resulted in an increased body weight. Therefore, it is likely that the elevated leptin in the FC group exerted an insulin-sensitizing effect, whereas the CP group was leptin-resistant, which is common in obesity [27]. The combination of the two supplements had no significant effect on the leptin expression. When FC was mixed with collagen, there was no statistically significant change in leptin levels, but a tendency for a lower expression was noted. Yet, CP mixed with collagen promoted a statistically significant reduction of the leptin expression, approximating those of the control diet group, which is consistent with the improved glucose tolerance observed in this group of mice (Figure 3B). Altogether, our results showed that the FC may exert a leptin-sensitizing effect, leading to an improved glucose tolerance, while the combination of CP with collagen displayed an anti-obesity effect.

Environmentally exposed tissues, like skin, mouth, gut, and vagina, are the most prominent body surfaces colonized by microorganisms. It is estimated that over 100 trillion bacteria colonize the distal gut, making the human gut one of the most complex ecosystems of the world, which also includes eukaryotic symbionts, altogether comprising the gut microbiome [28,29]. The gut is primarily colonized by symbiotic bacteria, being the main component of the intestinal microbiome that is known to affect health. Certain commensal bacteria are known to exert beneficial effects to the host, such as limiting colonization of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, providing nutrients, metabolizing undigested nutrients and even promoting the development and function of the immune system [30,31,32]. However, microbial imbalance and dysbiosis can be caused by external factors, such as antibiotic consumption, dietary changes, physical and psychological stress, resulting in gut enrichment with opportunistic microorganisms impairing the host’s wellness and homeostasis. The gastrointestinal microbial composition and host immune tolerance are subjected to a continuous interplay. Dysbiosis promotes the induction of host inflammatory responses and the onset of pathogenesis of a broad spectrum of diseases, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), celiac disease, obesity, colorectal cancer, autism spectrum disorder and it is even associated with the modulation of the host’s brain function and epigenome [33,34,35]. We, therefore, tested whether supplementation with fish-derived supplements alters the gut microbiome and affects its composition to reverse dysbiosis induced by a fat-containing diet.

The taxonomic classification of the identified OTUs revealed major differences, mainly among the genera comprising the ND-fed mice and the HFD-fed mice (Figure 5A). In particular, HFD-fed mice were represented by a larger fraction of uncultured bacteria compared to ND-fed mice, since nutrient diversity was restricted due to HFD and the effort to meet energy demands drove an increase in gut microbial biodiversity, but not an increase in beneficial microbial species [36]. In addition, collagen-containing supplements induced the colonization of Bacteroides, Helicobacter, Alistipes and Odoribacter genera, while they reduced the abundance of Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group and Ruminiclostridium 9 genera (Figure 5B). Although Helicobacter pylori is the most commonly detected species of the genus and associated with the induction of inflammation, non-H. pylori species were detected (Figure S1, Supplementary Materials) [37,38]. Bacteroides is the predominant genus of the phylum Bacteroidetes present in the gut microenvironment [12]. Although members of that genus can colonize different parts of the body, such as blood, skin ulcers, urinary track and exhibit high antibiotic resistance, they are considered as beneficial organisms when restricted to the gut [39]. Indeed, in inflammatory bowel disease patients, Bacteroides has been found to be decreased and is associated with disease remission [40]. The Alistipes genus is also member of the Bacteroidetes phylum, yet it is underrepresented in the gut microbiome, and it is usually found in healthy individuals. Contradicting evidence on its implication in health and disease pathogenesis exist; their presence is associated with mental illness, yet protective effects have been demonstrated in colitis, liver fibrosis, cancer immunotherapy, and cardiovascular disease [41]. In addition to their role in actively competing pathogenic bacteria, gut microorganisms can contribute in reduced intestinal inflammation through the production of metabolites such as butyrate and short chain fatty acids (SCFA). Members of the genus Odoribacter are known to produce acetate, propionate and butyrate, all known to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic actions [42], and ameliorate intestinal inflammation through the production of SCFA. Not only collagen-containing supplements but also fish complex-containing supplements could potentially contribute to a reduced intestinal inflammation. In parallel to the induction of beneficial bacterial genera, collagen-containing supplements reduced the abundance of Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group and Ruminiclostridium 9 genera, which are both butyrate producers (Figure 5B). Overall, this could be explained by the fact that intestinal colonization is a constant competitive process of microbes competing for nutritional resources, driving the reduction of certain species over the dominance of other more adaptive ones (summarized in Table S2, Supplementary Materials).

Collagen (fish skin protein powder) from the Seagarden company, Avaldsnes, Norway was extracted from Codfish skin (Gadus morhua). The skin had an abundant amount of collagen protein. Collagen was extracted by acid hydrolysis and digested using a mixture of proteases (180 mL Papain from Enzybel and 180 mL Neutrase from AB Enzymes 360 mL/4000 kg cod skin). Prior to extraction, the fish skin was pretreated with water to remove salt and blood debris, followed by alkali (NAOH 45%, 10 L/4000 kg cod skin) treatment to remove the non-collagenous proteins. Following the extraction of collagen with acetic acid, the preparation was filtered using active carbon and then concentrated by evaporation to around 45% humidity. The extract was then dried using the spray-dry technology (GEA dryer MS 850, GEA, Dusseldorf, Germany). Nutritional, mineral and microbiological analyses for the supplements were commercially performed by ALS Laboratory, Oslo, Norway, SynLabs, Stjørdal Norway, and SLab, Stord, Norway. The results are shown in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4, respectively.

All supplements were provided to the animals as 5% supplement embedded to the diet, which was a High Fat Diet preparation (DIO rodent purified Diet W/60% energy from fat, catalog number PF4051/D, purchased by Test Diets, IPS Product Supplies Ltd, London, UK).

The C57BL/6 mice were maintained in a 12h day/night cycle and 21–23°C conditions prior to treatments in a pathogen-free animal facility in the Medical School of the University of Crete, Heraklion. All procedures were conducted in compliance with protocols approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Crete, School of Medicine (Heraklion, Crete, Greece) and the Veterinary Department of the Region of Crete under license number 269904 (Heraklion, Crete, Greece). For the diet-induced obese phenotype, 5 (6 weeks old) female mice per group were fed a High-Fat Diet for 9 weeks. Each group was supplemented with 5% w/w of the corresponding fish supplement. A total of 5% w/w of soy protein was used as control supplement since the major source of protein in rodent grain-based diets is soy protein. Specifically, one group of mice was fed a standard diet supplemented with 5% w/w soy protein and another one was fed a high-fat diet also supplemented with 5% w/w soy protein. For the glucose tolerance test (GTT) the mice were fasted overnight and then glucose measurements were conducted to determine the basal glucose levels referred as timepoint 0. Then, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with sterile 35% dextrose (100 μL dextrose/35 g mice) and the blood levels of glucose were determined 30, 60 and 120 min post injection. All glucose measurements were conducted using the TRUEresult® Twist meter (Nipro diagnostics. Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA).

Epididymal white fat tissue (eWAT) was collected immediately after animal sacrifice, the weight was measured, and the tissue was stored at −80 °C for further analyses. The total eWAT was homogenized using the TrizolTM reagent, (Termo Fisher, Carlsbad, CA, USA), on a mechanical homogenizer. RNA extraction was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, 500 ng of the total RNA was reverse transcribed using the PrimeScriptTM RT Master Mix (Perfect Real Time) (RR036A, TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Two-step quantitative PCR was performed in technical duplicates using the Kapa SyBr® Fast Universal kit (KK4618, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR Instrument (Applied Biosystems®, 4351106, Foster City, CA, USA) with 96-well Block Module as follows: start step 95 °C for 3 min and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Primers were designed using the primer designing tool of the NCBI database selecting the gene sequence also from the NCBI database and choosing to span an exon–exon junction, 60 °C Tm point and PCR products between 70 and 200 bps. Ppia mRNA was utilized as internal control gene. Primer sequences were designed as follows: Ppia Forward 5′-ATGGTCAACCCCACCGTGT-3′ and reverse 5′-TTCTGCTGTCTTTGGAACTTTGTC-3′ amplifying 102 bps, Leptin forward 5′-TCACACACGCAGTCGGTATC-3′ and reverse 5′-GCACATTTTGGGAAGGCAGG-3′ amplifying 148 bps. The data analysis was conducted using mRNA levels expressed as relative quantification (RQ) values, which were calculated as RQ = 2DDCt, where DCt is (Ct (gene of interest) minus Ct (housekeeping gene)).

Fecal samples were collected from the large intestine and cecum. The amount of 200 mg of stool sample were used to perform DNA extraction using the NucleoSpin DNA stool kit (740472.50, Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. An amplicon metabarcoding analysis was conducted by amplifying and sequencing the V3 to V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene (≈460 bp). Libraries were constructed according to Illumina’s protocol for 16S post-genomic analyses described in “Illumina’s 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation” (15044223 B) manual. For the amplification of V3 to V4 regions primers were selected from Klindworth et al., 2013 [43] and were modified by adding an Illumina adapter sequence at the 5′ end of each primer. The size and quality of the generated library were evaluated on the Fragment Analyzer system (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) using the DNF-477-0500 kit. Sequencing was conducted on a MiSeq platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) using the MiSeq® reagent kit v3, (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). For the identification of the prokaryotic load bioinformatic an analysis was performed using the Qiime2 pipeline [44] (Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology). Quality-trimmed (minimum quality score of 28) and non-chimeric reads were assigned to OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) at 99% nucleotide homology against the SILVA 132 database, Max Plank Institute, Bremen, Germany, using the open-reference method and the VSEARCH tool (Versatile open Source tool for metagenomics) [45]. Phylogenetic relationships of the identified OTUs and samples were constructed in R version 3.6.0 [46], using the phyloseq R [47], ampvis2 [48], and ggplot2 [49] R packages. Barplots depicting OTU counts are normalized to 100% as abundance estimations within each sample.

Data are presented as mean ± SD. A statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism7.0. D’Agostino–Pearson, Shapiro–Wilk and KS tests were used to evaluate normality. As the samples did not follow a Gaussian distribution, a Mann–Whitney t-test was performed to test the statistical analysis of each supplement to the control diet. A 2-way Anova was performed to confirm the statistical significance of the results. Differences with a p value < 0.05 are considered significant (* indicates p < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01, *** indicates p < 0.001).

Herein, we demonstrate that fish-derived nutritional supplements suppress glucose intolerance in a model of high-fat diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes in mice and specifically nutritional supplements containing fish complex, fish complex combined with cod powder and cod powder combined with collagen. In addition, nutritional supplements containing fish-derived collagen modulated the gut microbiome in obese mice, inducing colonization of beneficial bacteria, known to have beneficial properties in suppressing metabolic inflammation and diabetes. Thus, our results suggest that fish-derived extracts may suppress type 2 diabetes and that this action may be partly due to collagen-induced modulation of the gut microbiome.
