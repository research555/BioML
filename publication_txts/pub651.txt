Ear wound healing in MRL/MpJ mice is associated with gut microbiome composition and is transferable to non-healer mice via microbiome transplantation

Adult elastic cartilage has limited repair capacity. MRL/MpJ (MRL) mice, by contrast, are capable of spontaneously healing ear punctures. This study was undertaken to characterize microbiome differences between healer and non-healer mice and to evaluate whether this healing phenotype can be transferred via gut microbiome transplantation.

We orally transplanted C57BL/6J (B6) mice with MRL/MpJ cecal contents at weaning and as adults (n = 57) and measured ear hole closure 4 weeks after a 2.0mm punch and compared to vehicle-transplanted MRL and B6 (n = 25) and B6-transplanted MRL (n = 20) mice. Sex effects, timing of transplant relative to earpunch, and transgenerational heritability were evaluated. In a subset (n = 58), cecal microbiomes were profiled by 16S sequencing and compared to ear hole closure. Microbial metagenomes were imputed using PICRUSt.

Transplantation of B6 mice with MRL microbiota, either in weanlings or adults, improved ear hole closure. B6-vehicle mice healed ear hole punches poorly (0.25±0.03mm, mm ear hole healing 4 weeks after a 2mm ear hole punch [2.0mm—final ear hole size], mean±SEM), whereas MRL-vehicle mice healed well (1.4±0.1mm). MRL-transplanted B6 mice healed roughly three times as well as B6-vehicle mice, and half as well as MRL-vehicle mice (0.74±0.05mm, P = 6.9E-10 vs. B6-vehicle, P = 5.2E-12 vs. MRL-vehicle). Transplantation of MRL mice with B6 cecal material did not reduce MRL healing (B6-transplanted MRL 1.3±0.1 vs. MRL-vehicle 1.4±0.1, p = 0.36). Transplantation prior to ear punch was associated with the greatest ear hole closure. Offspring of transplanted mice healed significantly better than non-transplanted control mice (offspring:0.63±0.03mm, mean±SEM vs. B6-vehicle control:0.25±0.03mm, n = 39 offspring, P = 4.6E-11). Several microbiome clades were correlated with healing, including Firmicutes (R = 0.84, P = 8.0E-7), Lactobacillales (R = 0.65, P = 1.1E-3), and Verrucomicrobia (R = -0.80, P = 9.2E-6). Females of all groups tended to heal better than males (B6-vehicle P = 0.059, MRL-transplanted B6 P = 0.096, offspring of MRL-transplanted B6 P = 0.0038, B6-transplanted MRL P = 1.6E-6, MRL-vehicle P = 0.0031). Many clades characteristic of female mouse cecal microbiota vs. males were the same as clades characteristic of MRL and MRL-transplanted B6 mice vs. B6 controls, including including increases in Clostridia and reductions in Verrucomicrobia in female mice.

In this study, we found an association between the microbiome and tissue regeneration in MRL mice and demonstrate that this trait can be transferred to non-healer mice via microbiome transplantation. We identified several microbiome clades associated with healing.

The Murphy Roths Large (MRL) mouse strain was originally selected for large body size in the 1960s; at the F12 generation, these mice developed a spontaneous mutation in the immune regulator Fas. This MRL/lpr variant is commonly used as a lupus mouse model [1, 2], whereas the non-Fas-mutant MRL/MpJ strain are generally used as a control in autoimmune disease experiments. In 1998, MRL/MpJ mice were found to fully close 2.0mm ear hole puncture wounds after 4 weeks, contrary to wild-type mice that do not close ear hole wounds [3, 4]. Subsequent studies have shown a generalized healing phenotype in MRL mice, including neonatal digital tip regrowth [5, 6], peripheral nerve regeneration [7], and cardiac wound healing [8, 9].

In the present study, we set out to investigate whether the gut microbiome is associated with the cartilage healing phenotype observed in MRL mice, whether this trait is transferable to non-healer mice via alteration of the gut microbiome, and whether microbiome differences are associated with sex-associated discordant ear hole closure in MRL mice.

The Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) approved this study (OMRF IACUC protocol #16–40, 19–43).

Young male and female (4 week-old) C57BL6/J or MRL/MpJ mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and housed at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF). Breeding pairs were created and pups were used for experiments. All animals were permitted ad libitum access to food and water (NIH31). The OMRF animal facility uses a 12-hour light-dark cycle. All animal husbandry procedures adhered to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. There were no adverse events (expected or unexpected) during the course of this experiment. The chow diet used for all mice in this study was the PicoLab Rodent Diet 20 (#5053 from LabDiet). This diet consists of 4.7% crude fiber, 5.0% fat (ether extract), 5.6% fat (acid hydrolysis), and 20.0% protein. Caloric content is 25.651% from protein, 13.205% from fat, and 62.144% from carbohydrate.

Cecal donor mice (B6 or MRL, 10–14 weeks of age) were sacrificed and immediately dissected under sterile conditions. The cecum was removed and cecal contents transferred to a sterile tube containing a 1:1 mixture of glycerol and phosphate-buffered saline (5mL), which was then filtered through a 100μM filter. The resulting mixture was aliquoted and frozen at -80C for subsequent transplantation. At 3–4 weeks of age, recipient mice were pretreated with omeprazole (50mg/kg body weight) as previously described [27, 28]. Omeprazole was then sequentially administered via oral gavage once daily for 3 days prior to microbiome transfer. On the day of cecal transplantation, 100uL of transplant material (per 3-4-week-old recipient mouse) or 300uL of transplant material (per 16-week-old adult mouse) was transplanted via oral gavage using flexible 30mm polypropylene tubes (Instech, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA). Mice were then moved to clean cages and segregated by transplant group. For adult transplantation experiments, 12 week-old mice were given 50mg/kg omeprazole once daily for 3 days, then transplanted on day 4, as above.

At 6 weeks of age (for young animals) or 18 weeks of age (for adult animals), mice were ear punched using a 2.0mm through-and-through ear punch. Ear punch size was measured to confirm 2.0mm initial size. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after ear punch (10 weeks of age for young and 22 weeks of age for adult animals). Whole blood was collected via cardiac puncture, allowed to clot for at least 30 minutes, then centrifuged and serum removed for subsequent analysis. Final ear hole size was measured using digital calipers, investigators were blinded to mouse group during ear hole size measurements. Ear hole healing (mm) was then recorded as 2.0mm—final ear hole size; this healing value is reported throughout this article. Group differences in ear hole closure were calculated using a Student t-test, with P<0.05 considered statistically significant. Cecal material was collected immediately after sacrificing animals and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cecal DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA microbiome kit (Qiagen).

Microbial profiles were determined by sequencing a ~460bp region including the V3 and V4 variable region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The gene fragment was amplified from approximately 30ng of DNA in each sample (primers in S1 Table in S1 File) using a high-fidelity polymerase (NEB Q5, New England Biolabs) [29] and confirmed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR master mixes were decontaminated with double-stranded DNAse treatment (PCR decontamination kit, Arcticzymes, Tromsø, Norway). Sterile water was processed using the same procedure as a negative control. Illumina Nextera XT indices were attached (Illumina), pooled in equimolar amounts, and sequenced on an Illumina miSeq sequencer using a 300bp paired-end sequencing protocol by the Clinical Genomics Center at OMRF.

Quality filtering, operational taxonomic unit (OTU) classification and microbial diversity analysis were performed using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) software package, version 1.9.1 [30]. Reads were clustered using the UCLUST algorithm [31] with a 97% pairwise identity threshold and taxonomy assigned using the GreenGenes 13_8 database [32].

Alpha diversity was characterized using the observed OTUs method following rarefaction to the lowest number of OTUs present per group (123,543). Beta diversity was evaluated on a variance-adjusted, weighted unifrac model. Principal component analysis was performed and an Adonis (permuted analysis of variance, a multi-factor PERMANOVA) test with 999 permutations was used to calculate the statistical significance of group differences [33, 34].

Group analyses were performed using the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) pipeline [35]. LEfSe performs a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis sum-rank test [36] to detect features with significant differential abundance between groups, P≤0.01 was considered significant. Next, it uses a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [37] to estimate the effect size of each differentially abundant feature. An LDA threshold of ≥2 was considered significant [38]. QIIME was used to calculate group Benjamini-Hochberg FDR-corrected q-values; q≤0.01 was chosen as the ’FDR-corrected’ significance threshold. For Gram status comparisons, differences were evaluated by Student t-tests, P≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Correlations were determined by comparing ear hole closure of individual animals with microbiome clades, P≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. No samples were excluded from analysis.

The Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) software package [39] was used to impute bacterial metagenomes from our 16S deep sequencing microbial DNA data, and functional annotation applied using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) catalog [40]. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic Profiles (STAMP) package [41]. Statistical significance and effect sizes among the three groups (human OA-eroded, OA-intact, and control) were calculated using ANOVA. Statistical significance was defined as Benjamini-Hochberg FDR corrected P≤0.01.

Raw 16s microbiome sequencing data have been deposited to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA), submission identification number PRJNA738540.

Our final analysis included 131 mice from 6 independent experiments. These included 25 B6 vehicle-transplanted control mice, 57 MRL-transplanted B6 mice, 29 MRL vehicle-transplanted control mice, and 20 B6-transplanted MRL mice. B6-vehicle mice healed ear hole punches poorly (0.25±0.03mm, ear hole healing 4 weeks after a 2mm ear hole punch [2.0mm—final ear hole size], mean±SEM), whereas MRL-vehicle mice healed well (1.4±0.1mm). MRL-transplanted B6 mice healed roughly three times as well as B6-vehicle mice, and half as well as MRL-vehicle mice (0.74±0.05mm, P = 6.9E-10 vs. B6-vehicle, P = 5.2E-12 vs. MRL-vehicle, Figs
1A and
2). Transplantation of MRL mice with B6 cecal material did not reduce MRL healing (B6-transplanted MRL 1.3±0.1 vs. MRL-vehicle 1.4±0.1, p = 0.36).

Next, we determined whether the timing of microbiome transplantation relative to ear punch would alter this healing phenotype. We performed ear punches of 6-week-old male B6 mice, similar to previous experiments, then performed an MRL cecal transplantation at 48 hours, 1 week, and 2 weeks after ear punch. There was a graded reduction in ear wound healing capacity in mice transplanted after ear punch (Fig 1B); the 48-hour post-ear punch group (n = 8) demonstrated superior healing compared to B6-vehicle mice (0.56±0.06mm vs. 0.25±0.03mm, P = 2.4E-5, n = 8), although there was a trend towards worse healing than mice transplanted at weaning (P = 0.11). In mice transplanted 1 week after ear punch, there was a trend towards improved healing (0.35±0.05mm, P = 0.11, n = 7). Healing was not improved compared to vehicle controls in mice transplanted 2 weeks after ear punch (0.26±0.05mm, P = 0.93, n = 6).

Although previous studies have indicated that the gut microbiome is most plastic in mice at weaning [42], the disease our laboratory studies (OA) is a disease of adulthood. Therefore, to broaden the applicability of our findings, we evaluated whether transplantation of mice as adults would still confer improvements in ear hole closure. To this end, we performed cecal transplantation of B6 mice with MRL donor material (n = 7) or vehicle (n = 4), as previously described, in 12 week-old mice with ear hole punch 3 days later. No differences in ear hole closure were seen in mice transplanted at weaning compared to mice transplanted as adults (Fig 1C) (B6-vehicle weaning: 0.25±0.03mm ear hole closure vs. adult: 0.25±0.07, P = 0.47; MRL-transplanted B6 weaning: 0.74±0.05 vs. 0.60±0.06, P = 0.25).

Both the bacterial and viral components of the mouse gut microbiome are heavily influenced by diet and other environmental factors; in fact, previous studies have noted dramatic differences in the microbiome when comparing the same strain of mouse obtained from different commercial vendors [43, 44]. Roughly half of our mouse experiments were conducted on mice raised in-house (originally from Jackson laboratories, but bred for use at OMRF, including donors and recipient animals), with the other half being purchased commercially from Jackson laboratories and immediately used for transplantation experiments as both donors and recipients. We found variations ear hole closure with in-house reared mice demonstrating worse healing in the B6-vehicle group (commercial vendor: 0.31±0.03mm ear hole closure vs. in-house: 0.16±0.05, P = 0.017) and improved healing in MRL-transplanted B6 (vendor: 0.57±0.04 vs. 0.86±0.07, P = 0.0036), with a trend towards improved healing in MRL-vehicle mice (vendor: 1.4±0.06 vs. 1.7±0.1, P = 0.082) (Fig 1D).

We then evaluated the heritability of improved ear hole closure following microbiome transplantation. We transplanted mice at weaning, as previously discussed, then created breeding pairs consisting of MRL-transplanted B6 male with MRL-transplanted B6 female, B6-vehicle male with MRL-transplanted B6 female, and MRL-transplanted B6 male with B6-vehicle female. The offspring of these breeding pairs were ear punched at 6 weeks of age and ear holes measured 4 weeks later to align with the timeline of our previous transplantation-at-weaning experiments. We found offspring of transplanted mice healed significantly better than non-transplanted control mice (offspring: 0.63±0.03mm, mean±SEM vs. B6-vehicle control: 0.25±0.03mm, n = 39 offspring, P = 4.6E-11); there was a trend toward slightly worsened healing compared to primary MRL-transplanted B6 mice (0.63±0.03mm vs. 0.74±0.05mm, P = 0.092) (Table 1, Fig 1E). There were no differences in healing among offspring where both sire and dam were transplanted compared to sire-only or dam-only-transplanted offspring (both transplanted: 0.65±0.02mm, n = 4, vs. one transplanted: 0.63±0.03, n = 35, P = 0.61).

Next, we profiled the cecal microbiomes of 43 animals, including 8 B6-vehicle (4 male and 4 female), 8 MRL-transplanted B6 (4 male and 4 female), 8 MRL-vehicle (4 male and 4 female), and 19 offspring of MRL-transplanted B6 mice (11 male and 8 female). All samples demonstrated high 16S sequencing quality, with raw read counts per sample ranging from 123,543 to 456,880. There were no statistically significant differences in raw read counts among any group. Importantly, we compared our B6 vehicle-transplanted mouse 16s findings from these experiments with wild-type B6 animals and did not identify any significant cecal microbiome shifts induced by the vehicle oral gavage or omeprazole pre-treatment (data not shown).

We then correlated microbial clades to individual ear hole closure among MRL-vehicle, B6-vehicle, and MRL-transplanted B6 mice. We found 48 clades highly correlated (Fig 4, S6 Table in S1 File), including positive correlations with phylum Firmicutes (R = 0.84, P = 8.0E-7), order Clostridiales (R = 0.76, P = 4.4E-5), and order Lactobacillales (R = 0.65, P = 1.1E-3). Negative correlations with ear hole closure were seen among phylum Verrucomicrobia (R = -0.80, P = 9.2E-6) and order Burkholderiales (R = -0.77, P = 2.3E-5). For many of these clades, significant group differences in abundance were seen among B6-vehicle vs. MRL-transplanted B6 (Firmicutes, Lactobacillales, and Verrucomicrobia) and all of these clades demonstrated significant group abundance differences comparing B6-vehicle to MRL-vehicle animals (Fig 4).

Female mice are less affected by surgically induced OA than are male mice [45]. As our study included both sexes, we evaluated sex-related differences in ear hole closure in control and transplanted mice, as well as any shared, sex-related microbiome differences that might underlie ear hole closure variations. Ear hole closure in MRL-transplanted B6 mice were not affected by the sex of the MRL donor mouse (P = 0.61), nor was closure in B6-transplanted MRL mice affected by the sex of the B6 donor mouse (P = 0.33). However, we did find variation in ear hole closure depending on the sex of the recipient mouse (Fig 5A). Female B6-vehicle demonstrated a trend towards an improved healing response (P = 0.059), with a similar trend found in female MRL-transplanted B6 mice (P = 0.096). Differences were seen in both female B6-transplanted MRL and female MRL-vehicle mice, where healing was significantly better than their male counterparts (P = 0.0015 and P = 4.2E-6 for B6-transplanted MRL and MRL-vehicle mice respectively). Furthermore, in heritability experiments, found a roughly one-third improvement in healing among female offspring compared to male offspring (P = 0.0038, Fig 5A).

For cecal 16S analysis, we pooled microbiome data from B6-vehicle, MRL-vehicle, and MRL-transplanted B6 animals and compared by sex. We first evaluated alpha diversity using the observed OTU method following rarefaction, as previously described, and did not find any sex-related differences (males: 646±13 vs. females: 632±21, P = 0.57). We found differences in beta diversity by sex both within mouse transplant groups (all P<0.001), and when all animals were considered together (P = 0.012) (Fig 5B). We then analyzed our 16S data by pooling all animals from the above groups and comparing male to female animals. We found 18 clades which were different between the groups (Fig 5C); among these, many were shared with those clades identified as differentiating MRL and B6 animals, above. These included phylum Verrucomicrobia (increased in males, LDA-ES 3.88, P = 0.022) and order Clostridiales (increased in females, LDA-ES 3.99, P = 0.011) (S7 Table in S1 File).

To offer insight into bacterial metabolomic and metagenomic changes associated with transplantation, we next imputed cecal microbiome metagenomic function using the Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis package (40). We compared MRL-transplanted B6 to B6-vehicle groups and identified 218 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) pathways altered within gut microbiota (S8 Table in S1 File) at an FDR threshold of P≤0.01. Of these, 48 were highly correlated with ear hole closure (P≤0.01) (Table 2). The strongest positive correlations included D-arginine and D-ornithine metabolism (R = 0.73, P = 0.0065), flavone and flavonol biosynthesis (R = 0.72, P = 0.0050), and mineral absorption (R = 0.66, P = 0.0030), whereas negative correlations included beta-lactam resistance (R = -0.78, P = 0.0027), penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis (R = -0.78, P = 5.8E-4), glycosphingolipid biosynthesis (R = -0.75, P = 6.0E-4), and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (R = -0.73, P = 5.1E-4), among others.

In this study, we provide the first evidence that the spontaneous ear hole phenotype seen in MRL/MpJ mice is associated with specific gut microbiome constituents and is transferable to non-healer B6 mice via gut microbiome transplantation. Furthermore, we describe novel sex discrepancies in ear hole closure in B6 and MRL mice, where female animals demonstrate improved healing compared to males. We find that transplant-associated improvements in ear hole wound closure are time dependent, and that the best outcomes are achieved if gut microbiome transplantation occurs before ear wounding. Intriguingly, offspring of MRL-transplanted B6 mice also demonstrate improved healing compared to non-transplanted controls, indicating transgenerational heritability. In cecal microbiome 16S sequencing analysis, we identified a number of clades that are associated, both positively and negatively, with ear wound healing, including phylum Firmicutes, order Clostridiales, order Lactobacillales, and phylum Verrucomicrobia. We also found a negative association between Gram-negative organisms and ear wound healing despite an increase in serum LPS levels in both MRL and MRL-transplanted B6 animals.

In summary, herein we offer the first description of the gut microbiome-associated nature of the ear hole cartilage healing phenotype previously described in MRL/MpJ mice, and demonstrate that this trait can be conferred to non-healer mice via a gut microbiome transplantation. We identified several clades within the gut microbiome that are strongly associated (both positively and negatively) with ear hole closure, and demonstrate that transgenerational inheritance of transplanted gut microbiome constituents and microbiome-mediate ear hole closure occurs. Furthermore, we found evidence for sex-specific effects of both ear hole closure and gut microbiome trends, with female animals healing better than males in a variety of contexts. Finally, we identified a number of differences in imputed metagenomes among healing-associated microbiome clades. Future work should focus on determining the mechanism underlying this microbiome-associated healing phenotype and expanding this analysis to include other animals identified as superhealers, including LG/J mice, Acomys mice, and perhaps invertebrate healers. The potential for a gut microbiome-mediated healing response should also be evaluated in the context of OA, which may offer a unique avenue for future therapeutic development.

We appreciate the reviewer’s comment; however, we do not feel a limitation of our current study was not evaluating a knee cartilage phenotype; the present study was focused solely on ear cartilage, future studies will certainly evaluate the knee healing phenotype.
