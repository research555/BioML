Dietary macronutrients and the gut microbiome: a precision nutrition approach to improve cardiometabolic health

Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiome is an important regulator of body weight, glucose and lipid metabolism, and inflammatory processes, and may thereby play a key role in the aetiology of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Interindividual responsiveness to specific dietary interventions may be partially determined by differences in baseline gut microbiota composition and functionality between individuals with distinct metabolic phenotypes. However, the relationship between an individual’s diet, gut microbiome and host metabolic phenotype is multidirectional and complex, yielding a challenge for practical implementation of targeted dietary guidelines. In this review, we discuss the latest research describing interactions between dietary composition, the gut microbiome and host metabolism. Furthermore, we describe how this knowledge can be integrated to develop precision-based nutritional strategies to improve bodyweight control and metabolic health in humans. Specifically, we will address that (1) insight in the role of the baseline gut microbial and metabolic phenotype in dietary intervention response may provide leads for precision-based nutritional strategies; that (2) the balance between carbohydrate and protein fermentation by the gut microbiota, as well as the site of fermentation in the colon, seems important determinants of host metabolism; and that (3) ‘big data’, including multiple omics and advanced modelling, are of undeniable importance in predicting (non-)response to dietary interventions. Clearly, detailed metabolic and microbial phenotyping in humans is necessary to better understand the link between diet, the gut microbiome and host metabolism, which is required to develop targeted dietary strategies and guidelines for different subgroups of the population.

The global rise in the prevalence of obesity is a major socioeconomic burden and is strongly associated with an increase in the incidence and prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases, including insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).1 2 Despite efforts to improve lifestyle choices and to increase insight in the underlying aetiology, long-term success in the prevention and treatment of obesity seems limited, as diet-induced weight loss is only maintained for approximately 25% after a 5-year follow-up.3 In recent years, advancements have been made in understanding the involvement of the gut microbiome in obesity and related cardiometabolic complications as regulator of host energy and substrate metabolism.4 5 Targeting host metabolism via the gut microbiome may therefore be a putative strategy to improve the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions to promote cardiometabolic health.

In this review, the complex interaction between dietary macronutrients, in particular dietary fibres and proteins, gut microbiome and host metabolic health, is addressed. The present review focusses on gut microbial metabolites produced in saccharolytic fermentation such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as well as proteolytic fermentation like ammonia, indolic and phenolic compounds, and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) (figure 1). We will discuss the balance of saccharolytic and proteolytic fermentation as important determinant of metabolic health. It is increasingly evident that this balance may be modulated by diet in a person-specific or subgroup-specific manner.25 At first, it will be briefly addressed to what extent microbial composition and its functionality relates to the host’s metabolic phenotype, including the putative underlying mechanisms related to gut-derived saccharolytic and proteolytic metabolites. Subsequently, we will discuss the impact of dietary fibres and protein on microbial composition and functionality and insulin sensitivity, as well as to what extent response and non-response are mediated by baseline microbial composition. Overall, we will provide insight into the importance of precision nutrition strategies to modulate microbial composition and functionality and, thereby, bodyweight control and insulin sensitivity. Finally, we will address what is required to translate findings within this field into more precision nutrition-based interventions and guidelines.

The gut microbiome seems to impact the host’s metabolic phenotype through the production of different metabolites.26 Through these metabolites, the gut microbiota may affect immune function and epithelial integrity, energy and substrate metabolism, and glucose homeostasis.13 27 28 This capability of interacting with host health is dependent on the type of bacteria present and the distribution of these bacteria in the gut microbial community. Since functionality (eg, fermentation capacity) varies among bacterial species, alterations in gut microbiota composition and diversity, as observed in obesity and T2DM, may subsequently affect metabolic processes and the immune system of the host.

Additionally, patients with T2DM and metabolically compromised individuals showed an altered microbial functionality and a decreased fermentation capacity when compared with healthy individuals with, in particular, a lower abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria.13 55 56 Furthermore, the gut microbiome of insulin-resistant individuals may have increased biosynthesis potential and decreased uptake and catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs, largely driven by Prevotella copri and B. vulgatus), which have been linked to detrimental metabolic effects.57 Taken together, there is evidence for decreased microbial gene richness and diversity in metabolically compromised individuals. Moreover, specific individual microbes may be regulators in (changes in) cardiometabolic health. Interindividual differences in gut microbiota composition and functionality may be linked to an altered responsiveness to (dietary) interventions, as will be discussed more extensively later in this review.

The interaction between the gut microbiota and host metabolism is multifactorial and depends on the microbial and host metabolic phenotype, which may be strongly inter-related. The production or activation of signalling molecules involved in host metabolism, the regulation of bile acid homeostasis, modification of gut permeability, the release of gut hormones, lipopolysaccharides and inflammatory markers, are among the mechanisms by which gut microbiota may influence the host cardiometabolic phenotype.58 Gut-derived metabolites may be either beneficial or detrimental to host metabolic health. In developing precision-based nutrition, the capacity of bacteria to produce certain metabolites should be considered. In this review, we focus on the balance between saccharolytic and proteolytic fermentations as a determinant of metabolic health (figure 1), as will be discussed in the following paragraphs.

The gut microbiota is capable of fermenting food components that otherwise would be unavailable to the host.59 Dietary fibres and other complex carbohydrates that cannot be broken down by enzymes in the small intestine can (partly) be fermented by bacteria in the large intestine as preferred energy source, producing microbial products such as SCFAs (predominantly acetate, propionate and butyrate).60 The main butyrate producing bacteria belong to the phylum Firmicutes, in particular Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Clostridium leptum, Eubacterium rectale and Roseburia spp.61 The production of other SCFAs is mediated by bacteria such as Bifidobacterium that produce acetate and lactate during carbohydrate fermentation. Also, A. muciniphila species produce both propionate and acetate.61 62

In human studies, however, data on associations between SCFAs and metabolic parameters cannot always be reproduced. For example, plasma insulin levels increased during hyperglycaemic clamps with acetate infusion independently of changes in plasma acetate in obese individuals.80 Beneficial effects of SCFAs may also be related to an increased secretion of intestinal incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). Acute colonic administration of propionate increased postprandial plasma PYY and GLP-1 and reduced energy intake.81 Furthermore, long-term colonic propionate delivery prevented bodyweight gain, reduced abdominal obesity and intrahepatocellular lipid content, and prevented the deterioration in insulin sensitivity in overweight adults.81 In line with these findings, human in vivo data indicated that in adults with overweight or obesity, fasting lipid oxidation and resting energy expenditure increased after diet-induced changes in microbial SCFA production or direct colonic SCFA infusions.25 82–85 Although most studies indicate a beneficial role for SCFAs in energy and glucose homeostasis,65 86 87 larger human studies are needed to elucidate the complexity of underlying mechanisms.

In a population consuming a Western diet low in dietary fibres, the microbiota of the distal part of the colon are more specialised in fermentation of residual peptides and proteins25 because the preferred fuel, fermentable carbohydrates, is already largely used in the proximal colon.88 Products of this proteolytic fermentation process include gaseous products such as hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide; BCFAs isobutyrate, 2-methylbutyrate and isovalerate derived from fermentation of BCAAs, phenolic and indolic compounds derived from microbial fermentation of aromatic amino acids and to a lesser, unknown extent SCFAs.89 In contrast to saccharolytic fermentation products, most products derived from proteolytic fermentation are considered detrimental for host gut and metabolic health,60 89 90 although some data in animals suggest a beneficial role of indole and hydrogen sulfide in gut and peripheral tissue function.91 92

Additionally, dietary choline and carnitine derived from, for example, red meat can be converted into trimethylamine (TMA) by microbial enzymes in the gut. This TMA reaches the liver via absorption and transportation via the portal vein. In the liver, TMA can be oxidised by hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenase into trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is strongly associated with the development of cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and systemic inflammation.94–96 Furthermore, in both murine and human studies, evidence is increasing that TMAO also contributes to the development of IR and T2DM.97–99 Increasing the availability of dietary fibres to the whole colonic microbiota might decrease the fermentation of dietary choline and carnitine, and therefore inhibit the production of the TMAO precursor TMA. Indeed, a rodent study demonstrated that a high amount of fermentable fibres derived from wheat bran lowered colonic TMA lyase activity.100 However, whether this can be translated to humans has to be elucidated.

Shaping of the adult gut microbiome is already initiated in early life, depending on factors such as exposure to the maternal microbiome, the mode of delivery and early exposure to dietary components,101 although the contribution of these factors cannot always be confirmed.102 Of the many factors influencing gut microbiota composition and function throughout all life stages, diet is key in modulating abundances of specific bacterial species and their functions.16 103 Vice versa, an individual’s response to a certain diet or dietary components may be largely influenced by features of the gut microbiota.39 This bidirectional interaction between diet and an individual’s microbiota forms a basis for understanding the concept of precision nutrition in the light of a third component: the host’s metabolic health.

In the current Western world, habitual diet composition has shifted towards a diet high in energy-dense foods, including relatively high amounts of saturated fat and simple carbohydrates, and low amounts of dietary fibre. Especially the consumption of dietary fibre, but also the macronutrient quality along with the quantity consumed can strongly influence gut microbiota composition and functionality. Population-based metagenomics analysis revealed associations between microbial composition and diversity and the habitual diet for over 60 dietary factors.These factors include energy and macronutrient intake and consumption of specific food items such as bread and soft drinks. These data confirm the importance of diet in shaping the gut microbiome.37 104

Interestingly, a 1-year intervention study comparing the effects of an energy-restricted Mediterranean diet with increased physical activity to an isocaloric Mediterranean diet in overweight/obese adults showed marked differences in changes of the gut microbiota composition between the groups. Nonetheless, the tendency of microbial shift was in the same direction for both diets.113 Besides dietary macronutrient intake, other bioactive compounds may also affect gut microbiome composition and activity. Examples are dietary polyphenols,114 micronutrients, vitamins115 and probiotics116 and may contribute to the gut microbiota–host metabolism cross-talk. In the following paragraphs, we will highlight the effects of dietary macronutrient intake on the human gut microbiota and will link this to host metabolic outcomes. An overview of relevant human studies relating dietary macronutrient or dietary patterns to the gut microbiome is provided in table 1.

Digestion of carbohydrates is a complex process involving specific enzymes for the type of carbohydrate ingested. The majority of digestible dietary carbohydrates are digested and absorbed in the small intestine, whereas certain, for a large part indigestible carbohydrates, including resistant starch and dietary fibres, are prone to fermentation by gut microbes with the highest content in the colon. Dietary fibres have been shown to have significant effects on the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota associated with health benefits.117–119 These dietary fibres may vary in their structural, physical and chemical properties such as water solubility, viscosity, binding and bulking ability, and fermentability.117 Highly fermentable fibres, such as β-glucan, inulin and galacto-oligosaccharides, are well defined in terms of effects on microbiota composition and production of gut metabolites,25 while insoluble fibres, although partially fermented, are mostly known for their beneficial effects on stool consistency and colonic transit time.120–122

Overall, the effectiveness of prebiotic dietary fibres on metabolic health outcomes may depend on several parameters, including initial microbial composition as well as the site of microbial fermentation.

Ingested dietary proteins are first digested in the small intestine by pancreatic enzymes and peptidases from enterocytes. A significant amount of oligopeptides and amino acids is then transported to the portal bloodstream via enterocyte transporters where they are used as amino acid precursors for protein synthesis or metabolised for fuels or precursors necessary for intestinal mucosal metabolites.88 128 129 Since fermentable carbohydrates are preferentially used over proteins by most bacteria in the distal small intestine and proximal colon, most fermentation of amino acids as an energy source occurs in the distal colon, where carbohydrates are depleted.130 The percentage of ingested protein reaching the large intestine is likely also dependent on protein quality, with estimated numbers around 10%.131 Protein originating from plants have a lower digestibility due to the indigestible cell wall of the plant,132 while protein derived from animals can be more easily digested in the large intestine, indicating potential difference in functional outcomes. Metabolites resulting from proteolysis (figure 1) can be either used by colonocytes or excreted in faeces.128 Most proteolytic products are considered to have detrimental effects on gut and host metabolic health.89 Furthermore, the balance between proteolytic and saccharolytic fermentation may determine the non-response to lifestyle interventions133 and should therefore be considered in future research.134

Although proteolytic metabolites are predominantly associated with adverse health effects, current evidence also suggests that proteolytic metabolites may have beneficial effects on metabolic health. For instance, several amino acid-derived compounds that can be produced only by gut bacteria (indole) or by mammalian host (tyramine, tryptamine and SCFAs) (in)directly impact satiety and gut motility in mammals via effects on GLP-1 and serotonin secretion from enteroendocrine cells.143 However, the physiological effect on the host intestinal and peripheral tissues of the majority of these compounds is still not well understood. In addition, the distinction between human and bacterial origins of many of these compounds has not been well established yet, and further in vivo studies are necessary to validate such effects.

Dietary fats have been studied extensively in relation to diet-related metabolic diseases such as obesity, but the effects on the gut microbiota are less defined in humans, and studies often yield opposite findings.144 FAs differing in type (saturated vs monosaturated and polyunsaturated FAs), carbon chain length and the degree of saturation may have a distinct effect on the gut microbiota composition.109 Cross-sectional studies indicate that consumption of a diet rich in animal protein and fat was associated with the Bacteroides enterotype, while higher-fibre, fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with the Prevotella enterotype in healthy adults.145 Furthermore, a high intake of mainly saturated fatty acids (SFAs) has been associated with a decrease in gut microbial richness and diversity in both adults and infants.146 147 In people with overweight and obesity, SFAs were negatively associated with the genus Intestinimonas, whereas SFAs were positively associated with Roseburia, which was also highly abundant in individuals with normal body weight.50 In this study, habitual SFA intake exhibited opposite association profiles with butyrate-producing bacteria, depending on the BMI. Overall, it should be noted that dietary fat–microbiome–host physiology interactions are studied less extensively compared with dietary fibre, and that the mechanistic knowledge is largely based on animal studies. Interpretation of these findings in light of human physiology is difficult and should be investigated further.

Second, out of a wide array of dietary components, dietary polyphenols and their effect on the gut microbiome and host metabolism have been studied extensively in recent years. Polyphenols, present as phenolic compounds in mainly fruits and vegetables, are known for their beneficial effects as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, cancer preventive and neuroprotective agents.148 A 2-month epigallocatechin-3-gallate supplementation, naturally present in tea, had both an effect on bile acid metabolism and Verrucomicrobiaceae abundance in mice with obesity, under which it promoted the increase of A. muciniphila abundance.149 The latter has been associated with beneficial metabolic effects in other studies.52 150 151 Additionally, although also in an animal model, 8-week polyphenol supplementation protected from diet-induced obesity, IR and intestinal inflammation, in association with increased abundance of Akkermansia spp.114 In healthy, overweight or obese individuals, 12-week combined resveratrol and epigallocatechin-3-gallate supplementation improved both metabolic parameters and decreased Bacteroidetes in men but not in women.152 Overall, adding dietary polyphenols to a diet seems to promote both gut and metabolic health, although mechanistical insights in human studies are still required.

Microbiome-based precision nutrition to predict metabolic health parameters like glycaemic response and variability, or used to counteract metabolic disarrangements has currently received major scientific attention. A landmark study within this field showed that, despite high interpersonal variability in postprandial glucose response, personalised diets (based on habitual diet, physical activity and gut microbiota) created with the help of a machine-learning algorithm may successfully lower blood glucose responses.39 The postprandial predictive capacity of the gut microbiome to meal challenges was again highlighted in another study, showing that an individual’s microbiome had a greater influence (explaining 7.1% of variance) than meal macronutrients (explaining 3.6% of variance) for predicting postprandial lipaemia, but not for postprandial glycaemia (explaining 6.0% and 15.4% of variance, respectively).38 In line with this, significant interpersonal differences were found in glycaemic response to different types of bread, and this glycaemic response could be predicted by baseline microbiome features.153 Of note, these studies mainly based their findings on responses to acute meal challenges and short-term interventions rather than on longer-term intervention responses. Conclusive results for the latter is still scarce, but the predictive capacity of the gut microbiome is becoming more evident, especially in studies examining the effects of fibre and faecal microbiota transplantation.13 14 40

Overall, we conclude that current evidence for developing optimal dietary interventions targeting bodyweight control and IR via the gut microbiota is still in its infancy and does not capture the complexity of the integration of a whole-diet approach, the microbial and the host’s metabolic phenotype (figure 2). Implementation of targeted, precision nutrition intervention strategies or dietary guidelines for individuals or subgroups in public health is still more remote and will require insight in the mechanisms involved in (non-)response to dietary intervention, implying that we need to go beyond prediction models. Detailed individual phenotyping and gaining insights into the balance between carbohydrate and protein fermentation by the gut microbiota as well as the site of fermentation in the colon are thereby key.
