Effect of Mannan-rich fraction supplementation on commercial broiler intestinum tenue and cecum microbiota

The broiler gastrointestinal microbiome is a potent flock performance modulator yet may also serve as a reservoir for pathogen entry into the food chain. The goal of this project was to characterise the effect of mannan rich fraction (MRF) supplementation on microbiome diversity and composition of the intestinum tenue and cecum of commercial broilers. This study also aimed to address some of the intrinsic biases that exist in microbiome studies which arise due to the extensive disparity in 16S rRNA gene copy numbers between bacterial species and due to large intersample variation.

We observed a divergent yet rich microbiome structure between different anatomical sites and observed the explicit effect MRF supplementation had on community structure, diversity, and pathogen modulation. Birds supplemented with MRF displayed significantly higher species richness in the cecum and significantly different bacterial community composition in each gastrointestinal (GI) tract section. Supplemented birds had lower levels of the zoonotic pathogens Escherichia coli and Clostridioides difficile across all three intestinum tenue sites highlighting the potential of MRF supplementation in maintaining food chain integrity. Higher levels of probiotic genera (eg. Lactobacillus and Blautia) were also noted in the MRF supplemented birds. Following MRF supplementation, the cecum displayed higher relative abundances of both short chain fatty acid (SFCA) synthesising bacteria and SCFA concentrations.

Mannan rich fraction addition has been observed to reduce the bioburden of pathogens in broilers and to promote greater intestinal tract microbial biodiversity. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to investigate the effect of mannan-rich fraction supplementation on the microbiome associated with different GI tract anatomical geographies. In addition to this novelty, this study also exploited machine learning and biostatistical techniques to correct the intrinsic biases associated with microbiome community studies to enable a more robust understanding of community structure.

In recent years, the health impact of intestinal and cecal microbiome composition has become a prominent research focus in poultry science [29], 42]. Understanding and modulating the intrinsic and extrinsic interplay between differential microbial populations and their host environment has led to improved animal health and greater profitability in agricultural endeavours [23]. At present, broiler chickens (Gallus gallus subsp. domesticus; “broilers”) constitute the most consumed meat worldwide, with an approximate 100 million tons of poultry meat produced annually [67]. Due to their economic importance, high nutritive value, and accessibility of their meat, broilers have been extensively subjected to, and immensely benefitted from, intestinal microbiome composition and modulation analyses [11–13, 74]. The combined efforts of such research endeavours have reduced chick mortality, increased growth rates, and reduced the microbial load of major poultry and human pathogens [17, 52, 93]. Efforts of particular importance (and success) involve modulating microbiome composition using feed supplements [11].

Avian gut microbiome reports display considerable animal-to-animal variation which has the potential to incorrectly bias post hoc statistical comparisons [30, 99]. To counter this problem, we employed isolation forests (a common machine learning technique) and median imputation to each sample to remove and replace any outliers to decipher any previously unseen underlying trends [56]). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of MRF addition on the microbial communities of the three main GI nutrient absorption sites (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) of the intestinum tenue (“small intestine”) and the cecum in broilers. By removing intrinsic and extrinsic biases from 16S rRNA gene counts and cumulative community structures, we aim to highlight otherwise overlooked microbial taxa that may be of importance in food safety microbiology.

This broiler trial was performed at a commercial production site within the European Union. On the day of hatch, chicks were taken from a commercial hatchery and transported to an associated commercial farm. Approximately 35,000 birds were placed from the hatchery into each of two sheds where they received a control standard commercial wheat-soya diet or a standard diet plus MRF (Alltech Biotechnology) at the following inclusion rates; 1300:1000:600 gt−1 starter, grower, and finisher rations respectively. Birds were raised and fed as per typical commercial production conditions receiving feed and water ad libitum. All other conditions were kept uniform for both sheds. At day 35 (post-hatch) the intact gastrointestinal tracts of 12 randomly caught birds per shed were excised immediately after humane euthanisation. Intestinal contents from the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and cecum were massaged into individual sterile tubes, immediately frozen on dry ice, transported within 8 h and stored at −80 °C for downstream processing.

DNA was extracted from intestinal contents using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 0.05 g of intestinal content (QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit, Qiagen). Genomic DNA concentration was determined at a wavelength of 260 nm using a NanoDrop (NanoDrop). Isolated DNA was then used as a template in PCR amplification for construction of 16S rDNA libraries which were prepared and sequenced by BaseClear genomics. Sequencing libraries were prepared by amplification and barcoding of the 16S rRNA gene V3–V4 region and the resulting amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform generating 10–50 k PE300 reads per sample. The mean library size used was 580 bp (inclusive of barcodes and adapters) and the insert size was approximately 460 bp (580–120 = 460 bp). A total 3,988,410 reads were achieved. In the control dataset, average reads for each of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum and cecum were observed to be 41,749.42 ± 6442.53, 45,074.75 ± 6468.97, 42,135.83 ± 7449.29, and 48,489.92 ± 4364.9 respectively. Comparatively, in the MRF-treated dataset average reads of 35,883.92 ± 4765.3, 35,644.5 ± 9590.25, 43,873.5 ± 6593.51, 39,495.67 ± 8224.7 for the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and cecum were observed.

Each sample was adapter and quality trimmed using TrimGalore! v.0.6.6 [54]under default settings and powered with cutadapt v.3.0 [64] and FastQC v.0.11.9 [7]. Between 14,044 and 54,118 reads were observed pre-quality-control and between 13,868 and 53,830 after, with an observed percentage read discard range between 0.325% and 9.66%. Chimeras were identified using UCHIME v.4.2.40 [36] and removed. Quality controlled reads were merged using the “–fastq_merge” function in VSEARCH v.2.14.2 [37, 79 to give a single entry for each read pair in FASTA format.

A database of 16S rRNA genes was constructed by downloading all bacterial genome assemblies (n = 274,268) from NCBI assembly [51] and extracting all 16S rRNA genes using Barrnap v.0.9 (as used for rRNA detection by Prokka v.1.1.14 [83]) with default settings. Taxonomic lineages were assigned to each genome (and their associated genes) using the “lineage” function in TaxonKit v.0.6.0 [87] and standardised to the seven ranks (Domain, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species) using the TaxonKit “reformat” function. Sequences with length less than 1200 nucleotides (nt) were discarded to mirror the strict filtering methods employed during the construction of the SILVA database [75]. Remaining sequences were searched against all other remaining sequences using the “–usearch-global” function in VSEARCH v.2.14.2 with a minimal percentage identity stringency score of 0.97 (97%), self-hits were excluded, and, with the exception of Escherichia, Shigella, and Salmonella (ESS), top-hit pairs where sequences were observed to be from different genera were discarded. The ESS species were excluded from further filtration during this step due to the close evolutionary relatedness of these clinically relevant genera [38, 43, 91]. Finally, exact duplicates of 16S rRNA genes were removed resulting in a database of 68,724 16S rRNA genes from 21,928 species from 37 definite phyla and 70 candidate phyla/divisions (107 in total). This dataset is available for download at (https://github.com/RobLeighBioinformatics/Broiler_GI_microbiome).

Bacterial genomes are highly dynamic due to rapid gene duplication, loss, and horizontal transfer events which may result in varying numbers of 16S rRNA genes [95]. Alien and spurious 16S rRNA genes were removed during database construction, so it is anticipated that all genes in the database were chromosomal in origin. Species were weighted by the number of 16S rRNA genes remaining in each genome after the strict filtration steps during database construction. The median number of 16S rRNA genes was taken where multiple genomes from the same species were retained. Genera weighting was calculated by excluding all genomes not definitively identified to species level (eg. genomes labelled “Salmonella sp.” (as opposed to, for example, Salmonella enterica or “undefined Lactobacillaceae”) and assumed to be the median for all species in a given genus. For higher taxonomic ranks, the median of rank medians was taken (eg. for families, the median of all genera medians in each family was taken). This method was employed to prevent biasing from well sampled species in a genus compared to less common species (eg. Escherichia coli vs. Escherichia marmotae). This weighting table is available at https://github.com/RobLeighBioinformatics/Broiler_GI_microbiome.

Each read entry was searched against our 16S rRNA database using the “–usearch-global” function in VSEARCH and top hits with an alignment stringency cut-off of 0.97 (97%) were extracted (Additional file 1: Tables S1–S6). To mitigate taxonomic misassignment, the stringency cut off was increased to 0.99 (99%) for species level assignment. Read counts were then weighted using the 16S rRNA gene counts calculated above (Additional file 1: Tables S7–S12). The proportion of each weighted taxon in each sample was computed and normalised (closed) by dividing by a “closure constant” (CC) for each sample and dividing each weighted read count per taxa by the closure constant (Additional file 1: Tables S13–S18). This standardisation ensures all samples have the same number of reads for downstream comparative analysis. The standardisation constant was constructed using the formula:

Due to the extensive intersample variation observed in microbiome studies [99], as discussed previously, we endeavoured to remove extreme outliers to examine potential underlying trends that may be otherwise obfuscated. Outliers were removed and imputed with the median of the remaining inliers using uniForest v.1 with default parameters [56].

For all comparisons made below, median fold changes (ηFC) were calculated using the formula:

Fold changes have a lower limit of −1 (complete depletion) and no change is represented by 0. A FC is incalculable if η(a) = 0 as this represents a complete introduction.

Kolmogorov-Smironov tests [53, 92] using a Lilliefors’ distribution [59] were used to determine sample series distribution normality (H0:X ~ N(μ,σ2;HA:X≁N(μ,σ2); P > 0.05: X ~ N(μ,σ2)) and as all distributions were determined to follow a non-normal distribution, Brunner–Munzel tests [20] were used to compare taxa between the control and MRF treated datasets H0:B = 0.5;HA:B ≠ 0.5). A Brunner–Munzel test was used instead of a Mann–Whitney U test [62] as the data was assumed to have unequal variance due to the high level of variability usually observed in microbiome analyses [99]. A Bonferroni–Dunn (BD; PBD) correction [16, 35] was applied to each test (PBD = P × ncomparisons) and instances where PBD ≤ 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant (Additional file 1: Table S19) and the FC (as described above) was used to indicate the trend changes. Different ncomparisons were used to calculate PBD (by taxonomic rank) to strengthen confidence in results at lower taxonomic ranks, however, to restrict an overly stringent correction, statistical comparisons were only performed when ηControl or ηMRF > 20 (or ηsite(a) or ηsite(b) > 20).

A bias-corrected Chao1 richness estimator [24], Simpson’s D index [90], Simpson’s E index [90], and Shannon’s H index [85] was calculated for each anatomical site in each dataset at each taxonomic rank using the sklearn-bio (skbio) v.0.2.0 Python library (http://scikit-bio.org/). A Brunner–Munzel test (H0:B = 0.5;HA:B ≠ 0.5) was performed between diversity indices at each rank. A Bonferroni–Dunn correction was performed for each subset (ncomparisons = 4) and instances where PBD ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant (Additional file  1: Table S20). Statistical trend changes were determined using the FC calculation described above.

A Bray–Curtis distance matrix [19] was constructed between control and MRF-treated datasets for each anatomical site using the “beta_diversity” driver function from the “skbio.diversity” Python library and a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed on each distance matrix using the “pcoa” function from the “skbio.stats.ordination” package. A PERMANOVA was used to compare control vs MRF treated PCoA groups using 999 iterations (in = 999) as is common practice. A Bonferroni–Dunn correction was applied (ncomparisons = 4) and a PBD ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant (Additional file  1: Table S21).

The concentrations of three short chain fatty acids (SFCA; acetate, propionate, and butyrate) in cecal digesta was measured using gas chromatography after metaphosphoric acid derivation as previously described with minor modifications [77]. Briefly, 0.20 g of thawed sample was diluted with 2 mL double-distilled water in a sterile screw-capped tube, then homogenized, and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min at 10 °C. A volume of 1 mL of supernatant was then transferred to another Eppendorf tube and mixed with 0.2 mL, 25% (wt/vol) ice-cold metaphosphoric acid solution. Subsequently, this solution was kept at − 20 °C for 4 h. Samples were then thawed, 0.1 mL 4 M sodium hydroxide solution added and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min at 10 °C before analysis. The supernatant was then filtered with a 0.22 μm membrane, and an injection volume of 0.4 μL of sample solution was analyzed using a gas chromatography (Agilent 7890A system) coupled with a CP-Wax 58 FFAP CB column (Agilent) and flame ionization detector to determine SCFA concentrations in cecal content. The concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate were calculated and expressed as μmol/g of wet cecal digesta.

Again, Kolmogorov-Smironov tests (using a Lilliefors’ distribution) were used to determine sample series distribution normality (H0:X ~ N(μ,σ2);HA:X≁N(μ,σ2); P > 0.05: X ~ N(μ,σ2)) for control and MRF-treated SFCA concentration series. Equivarience was assessed using a Levene’s test (H0:σ2a = σ2b;σ2a ≠ σ2b) [57]. As equivariance was not observed between any pair and as one distribution (MRF-treated acetic acid) was determined to follow a non-Gaussian distribution, Brunner-Munzel tests were used to compare each taxon between the control and MRF treated datasets H0:B = 0.5;HA:B ≠ 0.5) (Additional file 1: Table S22).

The growth indices of the MRF supplemented broilers were compared with the control (Table
1). Feed conversion ratios and average live weights did not differ significantly between the two groups however, the MRF supplemented birds were on average 5 g heavier and finished 1 day earlier than the control group. Birds supplemented with MRF tended to have a greater European production efficiency factor (EPEF).

A total 3,988,410 sequence reads were recovered from the 96 samples analysed. In the control dataset, average reads for each of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and cecum were observed to be 41,749.42 ± 6442.53, 45,074.75 ± 6468.97, 42,135.83 ± 7449.29, and 48,489.92 ± 4364.9, respectively. Comparatively, in the MRF supplemented dataset average reads of 35,883.92 ± 4765.3, 35,644.5 ± 9590.25, 43,873.5 ± 6593.51, 39,495.67 ± 8224.7 for the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and cecum, respectively.

Differences in β-diversity within the intestinal microbial population between groups and between intestinal sections within groups were assessed using PCoA (Figs. 2 and
3). The PCoA plots shown in Fig. 2a–d show that the bacterial community composition at the species level differed significantly (PBD ≤ 0.05) as a result of diet in each intestinal section with PC1 accounting for 60.1%, 69.28%, 49.13% and 91.32% of the total variation; PC2 accounting for 18.61%, 8.36%, 17.78% and 3.17%; and PC3 accounting for 7.38%, 5.63%, 13.48%, and 1.74% in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and cecum respectively. The bacterial community composition between intestinal sections was also analysed for differences and showed that each intestinal section harboured a distinct bacterial community structure regardless of diet (Fig. 3a, b, PBD ≤ 0.05).

To determine which bacterial taxa contributed to separating bacterial communities based on diet and intestinal section, the phylum level relative abundances of each GI tract were considered (Table
2). At the phylum level, four main bacterial phyla were identified within each gastrointestinal section, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria (newly renamed as Actinomycetota Bacteroidota, Bacillota, and Pseudomonadota, respectively [72]). Phylum Firmicutes was the predominantly abundant phylum within each GI section. Following MRF supplementation, Firmicutes were significantly lower in the duodenum, and significantly greater in the cecum. Actinobacteria was identified as the second most abundant phylum in all control group anatomical sites but was significantly lower in the duodenum and cecum as a result of MRF supplementation. Proteobacteria were significantly greater in the duodenum and significantly lower in the ileum following MRF addition to the diet. Finally, Bacteroidetes was predominantly detected in the cecum compared to any other site.

To investigate the gut microbial community in different GI tract sections analysis of the common and unique OTUs was conducted, shown in the Venn diagrams (Fig. 4). A total of just 22 OTUs were shared by all 4 chicken gut sections in both the control and MRF supplemented groups. The number of OTUs observed in only one chicken gut section varied from 1 to 84, with the jejunum having the least amount of unique OTUs in both control (2) and MRF (1) supplemented groups and the cecum having the greatest amount of unique OTUs in both control (66) and MRF (84) supplemented groups. Neighbouring GI tract sections shared very few common OTUs with duodenum-jejunum sharing 8 and 4 OTUs, jejunum-ileum sharing 4 and 9 OTUs and ileum-cecum sharing 2 and 4 OTUs in control and MRF supplemented groups, respectively.

Cecal propionate was significantly greater (ηFC = 0.176) and cecal butyrate was numerically greater (ηFC = 0.009; PBD = 1) in MRF supplemented birds when compared to the control (Fig. 5). No significant statistical differences in the concentrations of cecal acetate or total SCFA concentrations were observed between the control and MRF supplemented birds (PBD > 0.05).

A large and diverse microbial community inhabits the broiler GI tract and contributes to overall health and growth efficiency by controlling pathogens, enhancing nutrient availability, and modulating immunological pathways (Borda-Molina, Seifert and Camarinha-Silva, 2018). Gastrointestinal microbiome composition and diversity is influenced by many external factors (eg. environment, age, breed, antibiotic use or dietary supplementation) which may yield beneficial or maleficial consequence [102]. In this study, the impact of MRF dietary supplementation on broiler GI tract microbiota (across the intestinum tenue and ceca) was explored. Supplemented birds were observed to finish one day earlier with higher average weight (5 g) and EPEF than their control counterparts (Table
1; indicating improved bird health and producer economic potential.

Dietary MRF supplementation was observed to yield significantly greater relative abundances of cecal bacterial genera from families Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae. Whilst these are typical of the main bacterial families found in the broiler cecum, modulating their abundances can have profound health impacts, such as reduced inflammation, reduced intestinal atrophy, and improved mucosal barrier function [66, 81]. The significantly higher relative abundances of probiotic genera Lactobacillus and Blautia in the cecum, alongside higher relative abundances of jejunal and ileal Lactobacillus indicate MRF prebiotic action [40]. In essence, the comprehensive impact of prebiotics have important host health benefits beyond that of simple microbiota modulation.

This manuscript aimed to address the bird-to-bird (intersample) variation associated with microbiome studies and is the first to apply such corrections to a comparative supplementation study across intestinal geographies. Each GI tract section presented a distinct bacterial community composition which were altered as a result of MRF supplementation. Results from the present study indicated that Lactobacillus was the most abundant genus in the intentinum tenue and that the cecum was most bacterially divergent. Birds supplemented with MRF had significantly higher species richness in the cecum and significantly different bacterial community composition in each GI tract section. MRF supplemented birds had lower levels of the zoonotic pathogens Escherichia, Clostridioides, and Shigella which are of particular importance for food chain integrity. Higher levels of probiotic related bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Blautia, were observed following MRF supplementation. Higher relative abundances of known SCFA producing bacteria (and SCFA concentrations) were also attributed to MRF supplementation. These bacterial and metabolite alterations highlight a protective role for dietary MRF inclusion to support broiler GI health and may allow safer meat to be produced.
