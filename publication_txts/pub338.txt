Perspectives on how mucosal immune responses, infections and gut microbiome shape IgA nephropathy and future therapies

Infections have been considered to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) because synpharyngitic hematuria is a common feature in IgAN. However, how infections participate in this process is still debated. More recent studies have also revealed that the alteration of the gut microbiome exerts a profound effect on host immune responses, contributing to the etiology or progression of autoimmunity. Considering IgA as the first line of defense against bacterial and viral antigens, this review evaluates the relationships among intestinal infections, gut microbiome, and IgA for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of IgAN. Moreover, as a prototype of IgA immunity, we provide detailed clarification of IgAN pathogenesis to shed light on other diseases in which IgA plays a role. Finally, we discuss potential therapies focusing on microbes and mucosal immune responses in IgAN.

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis in the world, primarily affecting young people aged between 20 and 40 years' old 1. In particular, 20%-40% of patients with IgAN will progress to end-stage renal disease within 20 years of disease onset 2. Despite an increased understanding of disease pathogenesis and improved treatment options, IgAN remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Currently, the diagnosis of IgAN can only be confirmed through pathological assessment via invasive kidney biopsy. Moreover, its corresponding therapies depend primarily on nonspecific inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and immunosuppressants, which are not uniformly effective.

This review mainly evaluates the relationships among intestinal infections, gut microbiome, and IgA for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of IgAN. Moreover, we provide detailed clarification of IgAN pathogenesis and discuss potential therapies focusing on gut microbes and mucosal immune responses in IgAN.

Briefly, IgA, the second most abundant isotype in the circulation, is known to mainly consist of monomers derived from bone marrow plasma cells, whereas secretory IgA is synthesized as dimers by local plasma cells before being transported to mucosal surfaces through epithelial cells by the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor. In serum, IgA is mainly monomeric, belonging to the IgA1 subclass with rapid catabolism (half-life: 3-6 d) 14. Moreover, IgA is the most glycosylated form of immunoglobulins, with carbohydrates representing about 6% of its content 15. Unlike IgA2, the heavy chains of IgA1 molecules are known to contain a unique insertion in the hinge-region segment with a high content of serine and threonine residues. These residues are the sites of attachment of up to 5 O-linked glycan chains consisting of N-acetylgalactosamine with a β1,3-linked galactose and sialic acids. Sialic acid can also be attached to N-acetylgalactosamine by an α2,6 linkage 16. Although IgA is derived from the adaptive immune system, they do have innate-like recognition properties. Polyreactive IgA seems to be a product of the coevolution of host and microbiota for the maintenance of symbiotic homeostasis. The peculiar property of IgA has been shown to facilitate its binding to different structurally diverse antigens 17. Currently, there have been no studies directly elaborating the relationship between polyreactive IgA and IgAN.

Apart from invading pathogens, dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been suggested to also contribute to the overproduction of IgA 13,26. In supporting this, studies showed that the microbial characteristics among patients with IgAN and healthy controls were different. More specifically, higher percentages of the Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Eubacteriaceae, Streptococcaeae, Escherichia-Shigella, Hungatella, or Eggerthella genera/species could be observed in patients with IgAN 27,28. Moreover, patients with IgAN presented significantly higher intestinal permeability, which was related to increased proteinuria, microhematuria, and serum levels of IgA when compared with healthy controls 14. Thus, it is necessary to clarify the crosstalks among mucosal immune responses, infections, and the gut microbiome in the development of IgAN. A deeper understanding of the dysregulation of IgA from the perspectives of intestinal infections and gut microbiome should be of pivotal significance in understanding the pathogenesis of IgAN and diseases in which IgA is involved, such as IgA vasculitis, ankylosing spondylitis, Sjögren's syndrome, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and dermatitis herpetiformis. Besides, it might aid the development of disease-specific therapies, as well as the identification of noninvasive disease-specific biomarkers in the future.

The majority of circulating IgA1 is known to be monomeric, heavily O-galactosylated, and considered to be derived from bone marrow-residing plasma cells. Bone marrow, especially the red bone marrow, is one of the critical components of the lymphatic system. It is the primary lymphoid organ generating lymphocytes from immature hematopoietic progenitor cells. Accordingly, bone marrow is an important source of plasma IgA in healthy human beings. It has been demonstrated that human bone marrow mononuclear cells can secrete a significant amount of de novo synthesized IgA in vitro 29. However, these kinds of monomeric IgA1 have been shown to be different from those found in the glomerular mesangial area and not considered to be pathogenic in IgAN 30,31. The rest of the circulating IgA1 is mostly dimeric and poorly O-galactosylated 32. At present, the origin of the circulatory Gd-IgA1 remains controversial. Plasma cells in the mucosal immune system are known to synthesize IgA1 that is predominantly dimeric, and galactose-deficient 33. The secreted Gd-IgA1 has been shown to be the same as that in the circulatory systems. Thus, it has been speculated that circulatory Gd-IgA1 might be the result of mucosal-derived plasma cells.

In contrast, some patients with IgAN have been shown to have clinical associations with intestinal diseases, such as IBD or coeliac disease. Being the most extensive and essential part of the mucosal immune system, the intestinal immune system is known to be an important site of recognition of antigens and immune cell activation 9,58. Thus, in recent years, some experts have held the view that GALT might also be an important site for the production of Gd-IgA1, affecting the development of IgAN. Furthermore, it was evidenced that Gd-IgA1 was also present in patients with ulcerative colitis 59. However, these findings were confined to sporadic cases and hence needed verification in large cohorts. More importantly, curative therapies of intestinal diseases have shown promising results in treating IgAN. For example, sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylic have been shown to inhibit the spontaneous secretion of IgA by intestinal mononuclear cells 60,61. Budesonide has been used to treat patients with asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and allergic rhinitis, and its enteric-coated sustained-release capsule was demonstrated to decrease the level of proteinuria in patients with IgAN, indicating a reduced risk of future progression to end-stage renal disease 62. Similarly, in celiac disease, gluten-free diets have been reported to decrease the levels of proteinuria and mitigate immune disorders in patients with IgAN, showing reduced levels of antiendomysium antibodies 63. Thus, further research is needed to determine the role of GALT in the pathogenesis of IgAN.

The propensity of mucosal infections coinciding with hematuria has led to the hypothesis that defects in the regulation of the local IgA response might trigger IgAN. Currently, at least 3 hypotheses have been proposed to address the role of mucosal infections in the pathogenesis of IgAN: specific pathogens, chronic and persistent exposure to mucosal infections, and alterations of the gut microbiome 23.

The third hypothesis holds that alterations of the gut microbiome could affect both systemic or local immune responses. Under normal conditions, the host and gut microbiome maintain homeostasis, with the host offering a balanced immune response to microbes. Respectively, innate and adaptive immune systems are known to form a biochemical barrier between the host and gut microbiome. However, in cases where the barrier is broken down, dysbiosis might occur, leading to a severe inflammatory response. Aberrant immune responses have been shown to lead to increased infiltration of proinflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, dendritic cells, Th1, or Th17 cells 85. Meanwhile, alterations of the gut microbiome could increase the antigen load and epithelial TLR recognition, which might thus promote the class switch of B-cells and the overproduction of IgA 23,86. This means that the ecosystem could shift to a state of dysbiosis, involving the overgrowth of otherwise underrepresented or potentially harmful bacteria 87. The persistent antigenic challenge might also lead to alterations of intestinal permeability, subclinical inflammatory state, or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue activation 88. For instance, the ectopic colonization of Klebsiella spp. has been associated with the persistent activation of the immune system. Stains of Klebsiella, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae 2H7 (especially the outer membrane protein X), have been reported to function as potent inducers of Th1 cells, contributing to the accumulation of TH1 cells observed in mice 89,90. The colonization of Candida albicans (such as the expression of adhesins and invasins on the cell surface) has been shown to cause persistent antigenic stimulation by promoting the release of IL-17 or IFN-γ by Th17 cells 91,92. Relevant studies have additionally suggested that the colonization of gut microbes could affect the intestinal immune status. Based on these, it was demonstrated that raising IgAN experimental model mice in a germ-free environment or using broad-spectrum antibiotics to eliminate intestinal pathogens could decrease the serum levels of IgA1 and IgA1-containing ICs, and prevent IgA1 mesangial deposition and glomerular inflammation 93,94.

Gut microbiota and their derived metabolites have been suggested to have a significant impact on immune homeostasis 95 (Figure
2C). It has been estimated that the intestinal tract harbors up to 100 trillion microbes 26. These gut microbiota maintain the integrity of the epithelial barrier and shape the intestinal immune system, balancing host defense with microbial metabolites, components, and attachment to host cells 96. Concomitantly, intestinal mucosa contains a large number of different immune cells that participate in the maintenance of a healthy microbiota community, as well as reinforce epithelial barrier functions 97. Mounting evidence has underpinned the essential roles of the gut microbiome as critical regulatory elements in host immune responses.

Intestinal epithelial cells are known to express different pattern recognition receptors, such as TLRs and NOD-like receptors, for immune surveillance. They have been shown to sense bacterial components, and induce signal transduction, promoting to the proliferation of epithelial cells and the release of cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and mucus by intestinal epithelial cells. For instance, lipopolysaccharides, the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, has been observed to have a capacity for activating TLR4 in cultured peripheral B-lymphocytes isolated from IgAN. More specifically, LPS was shown to strongly inhibit the expression of the core I beta3-Gal-T-specific molecular chaperone (Cosmc) mRNA, resulting in the overproduction of polymeric Gd-IgA1 109. Flagellin, derived from invasive pathogens, was suggested to induce proinflammatory cytokines by TLR-5+ CD11chigh dendritic cells in intestinal lamina propria, resulting in increased IgA in mice 110,111. Uremic toxins, such as indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate, indole-3 acetic acid, trimethylamine N-oxide, and phenylacetylglutamine, were also found to promote the release of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-12, resulting in intestinal inflammation and the overproduction of IgA 112. Specifically, indoxyl sulfate was observed to induce intestinal barrier injury through IRF1-DRP1 axis-mediated mitophagy impairment. Reducing the concentration of indoxyl sulfate or targeting the IRF1-DRP1 axis might be promising therapeutic strategy to palliate chronic kidney disease-associated intestinal dysfunction 113.

Intestinal infections and gut microbiome are both correlated with the host immune status, and especially the production of IgA1. Accordingly, the diet might amplify their effects either directly or indirectly.

Other dietary antigens, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), and β-lactoglobulin, have also been shown to have a role in promoting the synthesis of IgA-containing ICs. Orally administered proteins are absorbed by the adult mammalian intestine. As such, impairment of the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa or intestinal inflammation might result in increased absorption of these macromolecules. Accordingly, it has been observed that the anti-BSA antibody and levels of ICs were positively correlated, and the BSA antigen was present in IgA-containing ICs in patients with IgAN 119. Oral challenges with milk from cows (β-lactoglobulin) in patients with IgAN were reported to promote the elevated levels of IgA-containing ICs and could be inhibited by the sodium cromoglycate antiallergic agent 120. These findings have provided a view of the dietary antigens in the regulation of intestinal immune responses in the development of IgAN.

Additional evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has emphasized the importance of intestinal immune responses in IgAN. Recent GWASs in IgAN have identified several susceptibility loci, such as CARD9, HORMAD2, ITGAM, VAV, and HLA-DQ/HLA-DR. These genes were suggested to be involved in the maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier, the immune response to intestinal pathogens, and the intestinal production of IgA 121. In addition, these loci were shown to be shared among IgAN, IBD, and microbial infections. In particular, CARD9 has been reported to assist intestinal repair by promoting the production of IL-22 or coordinating Th17- and innate lymphoid cell-mediated intestinal immune responses. It has also been observed to have a role in shaping the compositions of bacteria and fungi 122,123. The ITGAM gene encodes the αMβ2-integrin α-chain (also known as Mac-1, CR3, and CD11b/CD18). It has been shown that CD11b+ IgA+ plasma cells produce more IgA compared with CD11b- IgA+ plasma cells 124. In addition, VAV3, along with VAV1 and VAV2, are Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors that are known to be essential for adaptive immune function and have been involved in the development and activation of lymphocytes 125. The VAV proteins have been shown to contribute to the activation of NF-κB in B-cells, which might be necessary for the production of IgA 126. Lastly, the combined polygene risk scores from GWAS were found to be significantly correlated with variations in local pathogens, as evidenced by the concordant geospatial distribution with helminth diversity. From a non-hypothesis way, these data implied that host-intestinal pathogen interactions were involved in shaping IgAN 121.

Currently, there are no disease-specific therapeutics for IgAN, primarily because of its unclear pathogenesis. It has been hypothesized that the alterations of the gut microbiome and undue IgA immunity in IgAN, might lead to the overproduction of IgA/Gd-IgA1 in genetically susceptible individuals. Thus, in an updated pathophysiological perspective, modulation of the gut microbiota, suppression of the excessive mucosal immune responses, inhibition of the production of pathogenic IgA1/ICs, and dampening of inner-kidney injuries may be promising strategies in the future (Figure
3).

Considering the pathogenesis of IgAN, the process of modulating the gut microbiota would mainly involve the elimination of pathogens, restoration of the microbial diversity, and regulation of metabolites to normal levels. The gut microbiome has been suggested to stimulate or palliate proinflammatory immune responses. This would be driven either by bacteria themselves, or by their produced metabolites, the immune cells they train, or another mechanism. Thus, various routes for potential IgAN therapies against the gut microbiome are under investigation, including nonspecific antibiotics, supplements of specific metabolites, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).

Apart from the use of antibiotics and specific metabolites, several novel therapies for immune conditions, such as FMT or the use of probiotics/prebiotics are being developed. More specifically, FMT was found to combat the cyclical diseased state by restoring a diverse community of microbes 133. Besides, in patients with ulcerative colitis, FMT could also increase the levels of the biosynthesis of SCFAs and secondary BAs 134. Mitigating immune responses or increasing the concentrations of SCFAs and BAs by FMT might decrease the production of IgA. Clinical trials about the safety and efficacy of FMT in patients with IgAN are currently being conducted (NCT03633864). Meanwhile, the past decade has witnessed the rapidly accumulated research on probiotics or prebiotics as a means to modulate the gut microbiota and host immune responses 135. Probiotic strains, just like lactic acid bacteria, have been suggested to increase the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 in vivo colitis models 136. Some Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera were also reported to produce lactic and acetic acids to lower the luminal pH and decrease the production of IgA in mice 131,137.

Intestinal immune disorders contribute to the overproduction of Gd-IgA1 and O-glycan-specific antibodies. Suppressing the excessive mucosal immune responses seems to be a promising therapeutic approach. Accordingly, the 2012 KGIDO guidelines suggested that patients with persistent proteinuria ≥1 g/d, despite 3-6 mo of optimized supportive care and GFR > 50 mL/min per 1.73 m2, should receive a 6 mo course of corticosteroid therapy. Based on this, these guidelines have also suggested the use of steroids in patients with IgAN and rapidly progressive crescentic IgAN 138. In the “STOP” trial, some of the patients with IgAN receiving supportive care plus immunosuppressive therapy were reported to have a full clinical remission as defined by the changes in proteinuria measured with a protein-to-creatinine ratio, and renal function. However, supportive care plus immunosuppressive treatment could not improve their outcome 139. In the “TESTING” trial, the decline of the annual rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate, or the time-averaged proteinuria in patients with IgAN was shown to be lower in the methylprednisolone group 140. Systemic immunosuppressants, such as budesonide, are subjected to high first-pass metabolism, resulting in low systemic exposure (about 10% of the administered dose). The use of these systemic immunosuppressants, however, would cause adverse effects, such as severe infections, hyperglycemia, or intestinal perforation. Thus, the clinical benefit of the use of corticosteroids in IgAN remains unestablished. Nonetheless, treatment of patients using prednisone plus cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil in combination with corticosteroid has been in progress in patients with advanced-stage IgAN (NCT03218852; NCT02981212). Some novel therapeutic strategies, such as using the macrophage-derived microvesicle for kidney-targeted delivery of dexamethasone, had been shown to suppress renal inflammation and fibrosis without apparent glucocorticoid adverse effects 141.

Considering that the number of IgA+ plasma cells and levels of total IgA have been shown to be lower in the large than in the small intestine, intestinal immune responses in the small intestine require particular attention 142. To this end, the ileum targeting-release immunosuppressants, where the Peyer's patches are enriched, represent an emerging class of medicines designed to control the local immune hyperresponsiveness with minimal systemic adverse effects among patients with IgAN. In a phase 2b trial, NEFECON was reported to decrease the levels of proteinuria, and appeared to be safe and well-tolerated 62. In the future, larger trials of longer duration will be needed to quantify the magnitude of relative risk reduction associated with this kind of therapy at risk of progression to end-stage renal disease. Besides, similar studies should be conducted in other populations. According to the pharmacokinetic data about Entocort™ EC, systemic exposure of budesonide (9 mg) was reported to be 9.6 ± 3.6%, and the maximum concentration was 4.9 ± 0.8 μg/L 143. Increased systemic exposure of budesonide has been observed in patients with IBD compared with healthy controls 143. However, there are no pharmacokinetic data on NEFECON in patients with IgAN. Since a part of NEFECON is known to be absorbed, there are some concerns about its systemic effect in patients with IgAN, which might directly affect mucosal immune responses in NALT. Further studies are needed to clarify its systemic effects. Meanwhile, a phase 3 multicenter study aiming to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the administration of oral NEFECON in patients with primary IgAN on a background of optimized RAS inhibitor therapy is currently underway (NCT03643965).

The class switch of B-cells involves both T-cell-dependent and T-cell-independent pathways. During this process, naïve B-cells transform into IgA+ plasma cells, secreting Gd-IgA1 to the apical surface. The T-cell-dependent activation pathway involves the activation of inflammatory cells, autoantigen presentation, expression of TLRs, as well as the production of cytokines or chemokines. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of the above pathways seems a feasible strategy to ameliorate immune hyperresponsiveness. More recently, a number of potent immunomodulatory drugs, such as hydroxylchloroquine (HCQ), have been introduced in the clinical setting. It was shown that HCQ inhibited the excessive activation of the immune system signaled by TLR9 both in vivo and in vitro 144,145, and significantly decreased the level of IgA and proteinuria in patients with IgAN and rats 146,147. Regarding the T-cell independent mechanism, atacicept, a dual BAFF/APRIL inhibitor, was shown to be both effective and tolerated. More specifically, atacicept decreased the serum levels of IgA in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus by 45% - 50% 148. A phase 2 clinical trial to test its safety, tolerability, and dose-response in patients with IgAN has just been completed (NCT02808429). Similarly, anti-APRIL antibody treatment in grouped ddy mice, a spontaneous IgAN model, was demonstrated to significantly decrease albuminuria, serum levels of IgA, and deposition of glomerular IgA 149. Likewise, VIS649, the humanized IgG2κ antibody targeting and neutralizing human APRIL through unique epitope engagement, was also reported to decrease the serum levels of IgA by up to 70% in non-human primates 150. BION-1301, a first-in-class humanized IgG4 anti-APRIL monoclonal antibody, is currently under investigation in a phase 1 trial among adults with IgAN (NCT03945318).

Regarding the already existing IgA1, the IgA1 protease (IgA1-P), which has been reported to function in aiding clearance has provided new insights toward therapeutic strategies for IgAN. Several pathogenic microbes (e.g., Sutterella, Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza, and Neisseria meningitides) were shown to degrade IgA by secreting IgA1-P 163, which cleaves the hinge region of human IgA1 164,165. The recombinant IgA1-P has been shown to markedly reduce IgA1 in the serum and IgA1 deposits in the mesangium, and mitigate inflammation, fibrosis, and hematuria in the α1KI-CD89Tg mouse model of IgAN 166. This kind of treatment seems to represent a potential option for a future specific therapy of IgAN. The IgA receptor family consists of the CD89 polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, the Fcα/μR, and two other alternative IgA receptors 167. The CD89 protein is known to be expressed on Kupffer cells of the liver, neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells. Interestingly, IgA was shown to be eliminated from the circulation via a CD89-mediated process 168,169. Hosts with hepatobiliary dysfunction, such as liver cirrhosis and bile duct ligation, have been shown to exhibit elevated levels of IgA in their sera, mesangial proliferation in kidneys, and hematuria 170,171. Thus, enhancing the functions of IgA receptors in clearing the excess IgA1 or ICs might hold great promise.

Several current therapeutic approaches have aimed in preventing subsequent damage to the kidneys, including the use of inhibitors of the complement system, RAS, and antifibrotic agents.

In IgAN, disease progression can ultimately lead to fibrosis. Current trials are attempting to address the use of the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) as an early intermediate in intracellular signal transduction cascades for the B-cell and immunoglobulin Fc receptors. Therefore, SKY seems to be necessary for the proliferation, differentiation, and activation of B-cells 176. The introduction of fostamatinib, an SYK inhibitor, in an autoimmune model of renal disease, showed that it could lead to cessation of autoantibody production and reversal of renal injury 177. Besides, mice treated with fostamatinib were also reported to display less fibrosis and inflammation 178. It is worth looking forward to the results from a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the safety and efficacy of fostamatinib in patients with IgAN (NCT02112838). The increased expression of the growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6), which has been strongly implicated in disease progression and mortality, has been demonstrated in endothelial, mesangial cells, and podocytes in IgAN 179. Moreover, AVB-S6-500 was found to suppress fibrosis by capturing circulating and bound GAS6. Thus, a phase 2a clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AVB-S6-500 in patients with IgAN is currently underway (NCT04042623).

This review integrates existing evidence and highlights the role of aberrant mucosal immune responses in the pathogenesis of IgAN from the perspectives of infections and the gut microbiome. As more in-depth insights into the relevant mechanisms become available, innovative therapeutic strategies to improve IgA-immunity related diseases would be available.
