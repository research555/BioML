Gut Microbiome and Metabolome Variations in Self-Identified Muscle Builders Who Report Using Protein Supplements

Muscle builders frequently consume protein supplements, but little is known about their effect on the gut microbiota. This study compared the gut microbiome and metabolome of self-identified muscle builders who did or did not report consuming a protein supplement. Twenty-two participants (14 males and 8 females) consumed a protein supplement (PS), and seventeen participants (12 males and 5 females) did not (No PS). Participants provided a fecal sample and completed a 24-h food recall (ASA24). The PS group consumed significantly more protein (118 ± 12 g No PS vs. 169 ± 18 g PS, p = 0.02). Fecal metabolome and microbiome were analyzed by using untargeted metabolomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. Metabolomic analysis identified distinct metabolic profiles driven by allantoin (VIP score = 2.85, PS 2.3-fold higher), a catabolic product of uric acid. High-protein diets contain large quantities of purines, which gut microbes degrade to uric acid and then allantoin. The bacteria order Lactobacillales was higher in the PS group (22.6 ± 49 No PS vs. 136.5 ± 38.1, PS (p = 0.007)), and this bacteria family facilitates purine absorption and uric acid decomposition. Bacterial genes associated with nucleotide metabolism pathways (p < 0.001) were more highly expressed in the No PS group. Both fecal metagenomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that the PS group’s higher protein intake impacted nitrogen metabolism, specifically altering nucleotide degradation.

Individuals striving to build muscle often combine resistance training with increased protein intake. A recent review article reported that 40–100% of athletes used some type of supplement, including protein, intending to improve athletic performance [1]. Most of the protein-supplement products on the market are whey-, casein-, or soy-based, and research has shown that whey, casein, and/or soy protein promote/s similar amounts of protein synthesis and strength gains [2].

Therefore, this exploratory cross-sectional study sought to identify the bacteria and metabolites present in the fecal matter of self-identified muscle builders who did or did not report taking a protein supplement (PS vs. No PS, respectively). We hypothesized that our group reporting protein-supplementation usage would have a different gut microbiota and metabolic profile than those who reported no protein supplement usage.

This exploratory cross-sectional study aimed to identify the bacteria present in the fecal matter of self-identified muscle builders using resistance exercise who reported using or not using a protein supplement. Participants were recruited from Sports and Health Science majors at the online university, American Public University System (APUS). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at APUS (protocol # 2018-097) and the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) (protocol # 10217).

A schematic for recruiting participants is shown in Figure 1. Participants were excluded if they met at least one of the following criteria: (1) took an antibiotic in the last three months, (2) consumed an anti-diarrhea medicine in the last week, (3) took a laxative in the last week, (4) consumed prebiotics in the last week, (5) consumed probiotics in the last week, (6) were diagnosed with cancer, (7) have Crohn’s disease, (8) were taking prescription drugs other than oral contraceptives, (9) were cutting for an upcoming competition or tournament, (10) were under 25 years of age, or (11) lived outside the contiguous United States. We asked potential participants to share their maximum squat, bench press, or deadlift and then calculated a weight-lifted-to-body-mass ratio. Those who could not lift at least half of their body weight were excluded. Each participant was asked if they used protein supplements so they could be assigned to one of two groups: protein supplement (PS) and no protein supplement (No PS). The participants that met the criteria were sent an email welcoming them to the study and requested verification that they were willing to participate. If their response was positive, they were sent a fecal collection kit. After collecting their fecal sample, the participant completed a supplement questionnaire; a workout questionnaire; an online version of the International Physical Activity Questions (IPAQ); and a 24-h food recall, using the self-administered 24-h dietary assessment tool (ASA24). Each participant completed the study at his or her physical location anywhere in the contiguous United States. Participants were recruited in two cohorts one year apart at the same time of year (October/November/December). For successful participation in the study, the participant had to (1) complete a signed written informed consent, (2) complete a signed HIPAA consent, (3) acknowledge that they were training to build muscle, (4) complete the required questionnaires, and (5) return the fecal sample. Thirty-nine participants provided a fecal sample and completed all the required forms.

A fecal sample was collected by using an at-home, self-collection kit (The Biocollective, Denver, CO, USA) sent to participants via Fed Ex overnight, along with a freezer brick, Styrofoam shipping container, and cardboard box to fit over the Styrofoam shipping container. The kit contained a specially designed biocollector that was placed over the toilet for fecal collection. Once the fecal sample (without urine) was collected, the biocollector was inserted into a special zip-locking barrier bag that was inserted into a zip-locked specimen bag. Then the specimen bag was placed in a Styrofoam shipping container, and a frozen freezer brick was placed on top. The Styrofoam container was placed into the cardboard box, sealed, and shipped overnight. To prevent receiving samples on a Saturday or Sunday, the participant was instructed to ship the sample on the same day of collection and collect it on Monday–Thursday, no holidays. If the sample was not returned within 24 h of collection, the sample was discarded, and the participant was excluded from the study. Upon receipt in the lab at LSUHSC, the sample was mixed in the sample bag in a biosafety level-2 hood and small portions aliquoted into sterile microcentrifuge tubes designed for cold storage. The tubes were placed in liquid nitrogen for quick freezing and stored in a −80 °C freezer. At the same time, a sample of approximately 250 mg was processed for DNA isolation, using the QIAamp PowerFecal DNA Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), which included bead-beating. The isolated DNA was stored at −80 °C until microbial community analysis.

Participants were asked to recall the foods they ate 24 h prior to their fecal sample collection. They used the freely available, automated, web-based, self-administered 24-h dietary assessment (ASA24) (https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/asa24/, accessed on 6 June 2021) [17], which is available on the web and mobile devices and is funded and maintained by the National Cancer Institute. Each participant was sent a unique user ID and password. Although the ASA24 program collects information on supplement use, we also asked participants to provide information about their supplements on a separate form. The 2010–2015 Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was calculated from the food group data provided by ASA24, using the SAS program code available for free, online, from the National Cancer Institute (https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/hei/calculating-hei-scores.html, https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/asa24/, accessed on 6 June 2021).

Physical activity was assessed by using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) long-form converted to an online format. Moreover, each participant was asked to provide their muscle-building workout routine on a separate form, since the IPAQ does not ask specifically about resistance training. In this form, participants reported the exercise name, workouts per week, sets per workout, reps per set, weight lifted, and 1-RM. Volume loads (weight lifted in kg x reps x sets x workouts per week) for upper-body or lower-body exercises were calculated similarly to the methods of Haff [18].

A Thermo Scientific™ NanoDrop™ spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to determine the quantity and purity of isolated fecal DNA. Two amplification steps, using the AccuPrime Taq high fidelity DNA polymerase system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), were performed to prepare a sequencing library. Moreover, a negative control with the control from DNA extraction and a positive control, using the Microbial Mock Community HM-276D (BEI Resources, Manassas, VA, USA), were included in the amplicon library preparation. Genomic DNA and gene-specific primers with Illumina adaptors were used to amplify the 16S ribosomal DNA hypervariable region V4: forward 5′TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA3′; reverse 5′ GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT 3′. AMPure XP beads were used to purify the indexed amplicon libraries and quantified by using Quant-I PCR products. The purified amplicon DNA was amplified by using primers with different molecular barcodes:

The QIIME analysis included 39 samples, with read counts ranging from 6729 to 99,983, with an average read count per sample of 44,812. Alpha rarefaction was performed at a level of 6729 reads to include all samples.

The 16S sequencing data were used to identify potential microbial functions. The raw data were formatted and imported into QIIME2. Closed-reference clustering against the Greengenes 13_5 97% OTUs reference database was used to develop a de-replicated feature table and representative sequences. The closed-reference OTU table was used as input into the PICRUSt [22] pipeline, and the resulting PICRUSt metagenome data were further analyzed by using STAMP (Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic Profiles) [23]. Pathways were labeled at Level 2, since several pathways were not classified at Level 1, which causes an error in STAMP. From this, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways were compared between protein-supplemented (PS) and non-protein-supplemented (No PS) participants.

Samples were processed at the Biological and Small Molecule Mass Spectrometry Core (BSMMSC) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN (RRID: SCR_021368). The fecal sample from each participant was divided into aliquots (roughly 50–100 mg) and extracted in biological triplicate. Polar metabolites were extracted from fecal samples using an acidic acetonitrile extraction procedure, using 40:40:20 HPLC grade ACN/MeOH/H2O with 0.1 M formic acid. [24] Global metabolic profiling, using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS), was used to analyze the fecal microbiome. A 25-min reverse-phase chromatographic separation was performed by using a Synergi 2.6 µm Hydro RP column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 100 Å; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) and an UltiMate 3000 pump (Dionex). After chromatic separation, analytes were ionized by using negative-mode electrospray ionization. A Thermo Scientific Exactive Plus Orbitrap (San Jose, CA, USA) was utilized for mass analysis, operating in full-scan mode [25,26]. A package from ProteoWizard, msConvert, was used to convert raw spectral files to mzML format [27]. Metabolomics analysis and visualization engine (MAVEN) was used to identify metabolites based on exact mass (±5 ppm) and retention time, using an in-house library [28,29]. A total of 170 metabolites were identified from the untargeted metabolomics analysis.

A power calculation determined that 24 participants were needed per group (PS and No PS). Thirty-nine participants completed the study prior to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We decided to stop participant recruitment at the start of the pandemic since its duration was unknown, and we did not want to risk exposure to the virus from fecal samples.

Metabolite peak intensities were normalized by the weight of each fecal sample aliquot. MetaboAnalyst 5.0 was used to generate partial-least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) plots, variable importance in projection (VIP) scores, and pathway analysis using the normalized metabolomics data. In MetaboAnalyst, the normalized data were filtered by interquartile range, log-transformed, and Pareto scaled [30]. Heatmaps were generated by using R (version 1.0.153), which displayed log2 fold changes and p-values calculated by a Student’s t-test.

Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences in age, weight, height, or BMI between the PS and No PS groups. Seventy-one percent of the No PS group was male, while 64% of the PS group was male.

Alterations in the fecal metabolome are shown in Figure 4. Heatmaps serve as a visualization tool for changes in the relative abundance of metabolites (Figure A1). A few metabolites were significantly different in relative abundance between the two groups (Figure 4A): allantoin (p < 0.01), dipicolinate (p < 0.05), tricarballylic acid (p < 0.01), octulose 8/1 phosphate (p < 0.05), xanthosine (p < 0.01), dATP (p < 0.01), abscisate (p < 0.01), pimelic acid (p < 0.01), methyl glutaric acid (p < 0.05), lactate (p < 0.01), sucralose (p < 0.01), S-ribosyl-L-homocysteine (p < 0.05), homocysteine (p < 0.01), quinolinate (p < 0.05), sulfolactate (p < 0.01), and homocarnosine (p < 0.01). Despite few significant changes, the 3D PLS-DA showed separation of the PS group and the No PS group, indicating different metabolic profiles between the groups (Figure 4A). Metabolites with a VIP score > 1 drove the separation in the PLS-DA plot, contributing most to the differences observed between groups (Figure 4B). Using metabolites with a VIP score > 1 for pathway analysis, it was evident that the purine and pyrimidine metabolism were altered in response to protein supplementation. Additionally, glycolysis, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and the TCA cycle were also perturbed (Figure 4C). All of the altered pathways are interconnected with nitrogen metabolism (Figure 5).

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the gut microbiome of self-identified muscle builders who reported using protein supplementations. Often, a high-protein, low-dietary-fiber diet is associated with bodybuilding. Scientific studies have shown that fiber and protein can influence the abundance of microbial communities present in the gut; however, protein’s effects are less understood than fiber. The recommended fiber intake for men and women under 50 years of age is 38 and 25 g/day, respectively [31]. However, dietary studies have shown that many individuals fall short of these guidelines. For example, in a study comparing the gut microbiota of 15 distance runners and 15 bodybuilders, Jang et al. [8] reported that dietary fiber intake was similar between the two groups: 17 g/day (distance runners) and 19 g/day (bodybuilders). However, the average protein intake was 103 g for the distance runners and 236 g for the bodybuilders. Interestingly, there were differences in the gut microbiome between these groups. At the genus and species levels, Faecalibacterium, Clostridium, Haemophilus, and Eisenbergiella were the highest (p < 0.05) in bodybuilders, while Bifidobacterium and Parasutterella were the lowest (p < 0.05) in bodybuilders. In our study, fiber intake for our groups was similar to Jang et al.’s [8] study, but, unexpectedly, the PS group consumed 8 gms more fiber than the No PS group. However, neither group met the dietary recommended amount of fiber. Our participants’ average protein intake was less than Jang et al. [8] bodybuilders’ protein intake. Faecalibacterium was the only bacteria for which we observed changes that Jang et al. [8] also reported.

Finally, nitrogen metabolism can be altered by protein consumption. A high-protein diet contains a large quantity of purine, a nucleotide. Uric acid is produced when purines are enzymatically degraded [44]. Uric acid is then further degraded to allantoin, the metabolite with the highest VIP score. The PS group had a significantly higher allantoin relative abundance in their feces compared to the No PS group. Since allantoin and uric acid, along with other metabolites involved in purine metabolism, are driving the separation between the PS and No PS groups, it can be concluded that higher levels of dietary protein favor purine degradation. This evidence is further supported by a greater relative abundance of f. Lactobacillales in the PS group (p = 0.007), a bacteria family that functions in purine absorption and uric acid decomposition [45]. Additionally, genes encoding for nucleotide metabolism were significantly more abundant in the No PS group. This observation could be expected, because the No PS group had a lower protein intake, which leads to fewer purines, creating a greater need for genes involved in purine metabolism.

This study is not without its limitations. First, the participants were recruited online, and although we emailed many potential candidates, we demonstrated that participants could be recruited in this manner. Second, once lockdowns from the COVID pandemic started, we could no longer recruit participants, and this reduced our sample size. Third, we had to rely on the participants self-reporting their resistance training, because they were recruited and participated in the study online. Self-reporting has inherent errors, but we used several measures, self-reported workout form and IPAQ, to verify their training claims. These were used to determine if the participants were physically active and had consistent resistance training. Fourth, the two groups were divided based on the participant’s reported protein supplement use. All PS group participants reported using a protein supplement, while the No PS group reported not using a protein supplement to promote muscle gains. We also verified this with the ASA24 24-h recall. The ASA24 reports supplement usage, and only the participants in the protein-supplemented group reported using a protein supplement 24 h before they collected their fecal sample.

Differences in diet and the gut microbiome and metabolome suggested that protein influenced the gut microbiota. The group reporting protein-supplement usage had more fecal metabolites and bacteria associated with nitrogen breakdown, leading to increased uric acid. In contrast, those participants who did not use a protein supplement had more genes associated with nucleotide metabolism, suggesting a greater need for the gut microbiota to synthesize nucleic acids due to the lack of a sufficient exogenous nitrogen source. While the health consequences to the host are unknown, it is possible that protein consumption leads to alterations in metabolites involved in the inflammatory response, such as uric acid, the precursor of allantoin. These observations warrant future investigation.
