Ecophylogenetics Clarifies the Evolutionary Association between Mammals and Their Gut Microbiota

Our knowledge of how the gut microbiome relates to mammalian evolution benefits from the identification of gut microbial taxa that are unexpectedly prevalent or unexpectedly conserved across mammals. Such taxa enable experimental determination of the traits needed for such microbes to succeed as gut generalists, as well as those traits that impact mammalian fitness. However, the punctuated resolution of microbial taxonomy may limit our ability to detect conserved gut microbes, especially in cases in which broadly related microbial lineages possess shared traits that drive their apparent ubiquity across mammals. To advance the discovery of conserved mammalian gut microbes, we developed a novel ecophylogenetic approach to taxonomy that groups microbes into taxonomic units based on their shared ancestry and their common distribution across mammals. Applying this approach to previously generated gut microbiome data uncovered monophyletic clades of gut bacteria that are conserved across mammals. It also resolved microbial clades exclusive to and conserved among particular mammalian lineages. Conserved clades often manifest phylogenetic patterns, such as cophylogeny with their host, that indicate that they are subject to selective processes, such as host filtering. Moreover, this analysis identified variation in the rate at which mammals acquire or lose conserved microbial clades and resolved a human-accelerated loss of conserved clades. Collectively, the data from this study reveal mammalian gut microbiota that possess traits linked to mammalian phylogeny, point to the existence of a core set of microbes that comprise the mammalian gut microbiome, and clarify potential evolutionary or ecologic mechanisms driving the gut microbiome’s diversification throughout mammalian evolution.

Research that links the biodiversity of the gut microbiome to mammalian evolution has fueled discussion about the underlying drivers of this relationship (1,–5). Perhaps the trillions of microbes inhabiting the gut perform vital functions for their host, such as nutrient acquisition and detoxification (6,–8), gut and immune development (9), and pathogen defense (10), that modulate mammalian niche specificity, survival, or fitness. Alternatively, mammalian evolution of physiology, anatomy, behavior, diet, or niche could influence which microbes are exposed to the gut (i.e., the metacommunity) or can thrive within it. However, there remains debate about how potential confounding factors, such as variation in diet (4, 11), management facility (12), or the local metacommunity (13), impact the observed variation of microbiome composition across mammals. The effort to disentangle these and related processes benefits from the identification of specific microbiota that relate to mammalian evolution. For example, studies that uncovered mammalian gut microbiotas that codiversified with their hosts (4, 14) or are subject to vertical inheritance (15, 16) or whose abundance associates with host genotype (16, 17) have supported the idea of the existence of a host genome effect on the gut microbiome.

We applied this definition of taxonomy to publically available microbiome data spanning diverse mammalian species, with the goal of resolving conserved gut microbiota, which are microbial taxa that are more prevalent across mammalian species than would be expected by chance. Our analysis uncovers clades of gut microbes that are conserved across mammals, as well as clades that are exclusive to and conserved among specific mammalian lineages. These conserved clades were integrated into or lost from mammalian guts in a manner correlated with mammalian evolutionary history. Furthermore, these clades manifest evolutionary patterns consistent with being subject to selection, such as host filtering. These results demonstrate the value of our taxonomic approach, point to the existence of a selectively driven core microbiome of mammals, and broaden the known set of microbes connected to the evolution of mammals.

We developed an algorithm and corresponding software (clade-based taxonomic units, also known as ClaaTU) that identifies conserved monophyletic clades of taxa, which are clades that display higher prevalence across a set of communities than expected by chance. Briefly, our procedure traverses a phylogeny assembled from 16S rRNA gene sequences generated from multiple communities. It then quantifies each clade’s prevalence across a defined subset of the communities, where the clade’s prevalence is based on the occurrence of the subtending lineages in the subset of communities. A permutation test quantifies whether the observed prevalence of the clade is likely due to chance. While ClaaTU can be applied to any phylogeny, including a sequence-level phylogeny, the following investigations analyzed OTU trees to reduce phylogenetic complexity and subsequently increase statistical power through reduced-numbers hypothesis tests. While sub-OTU patterns may be missed through this heuristic, the fact that few OTUs are shared across host species indicates that sub-OTU variation is unlikely to substantially affect our results.

We similarly identified clades that were conserved among mammals that were grouped by dietary strategy to verify that the aforementioned patterns of clade conservation were not due to the potential confounding factor of host dietary strategy (see Text S1 in the supplemental material). In doing so, we corroborated prior work by finding that omnivores carry clades that appear to be specialists with respect to either herbivorous or carnivorous diets (4). However, unlike prior work, we also identified conserved clades of gut bacteria that are unique to omnivores, indicating that omnivore-specialist bacteria may exist.

We used several phylogenetic methods to discern whether natural selection influences the conservation of bacterial clades across mammals. First, we assessed whether conserved clades are clustered across the bacterial phylogeny; such clustering would indicate that the traits that result in a clade’s conservation could arise through exaptation, be subject to environmental filtering, or improve dispersal (28). We calculated the phylogenetic distances between all pairs of conserved clades and used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine if the distribution of these distances differs from a bootstrapped distribution of clades randomly sampled from across the same phylogeny. Our analysis uncovered support for the idea of phylogenetic clustering of clades conserved across either Carnivora (P = 4.5e−10) or Primates (P = 0.03) but not Artiodactyla. Additionally, considering only those clades that are both conserved and unique to Primates (P = 0.015), Artiodactyla (P = 0.015), or Carnivora (P = 2.2e−9) reveals evidence of phylogenetic clustering. We also tested whether clades that are conserved across dietary strategies are clustered, finding that conserved carnivore (P = 6.7e−7) and herbivore (P = 1.7e−7) clades are clustered, while conserved omnivore clades are not (P = 0.11). However, support for clustering was improved by considering only those clades that are both conserved and unique to each of the dietary strategies (carnivore P = 2.6e−10; herbivore P = 6.7e−7; omnivore P = 2.2e−16). We determined that signal propagation of clade conservation among closely related clades did not substantially affect these results by repeating our analysis after excluding conserved clades whose parents were also conserved and finding consistent results. Our observation that conserved clades are phylogenetically clustered indicates that some bacterial lineages are more likely to become conserved than others, possibly because their ancestors evolved a genetic background that potentiated the emergence of traits that improved the fitness of these lineages or resulted in their selection by the host.

An emerging body of research indicates that mammals and at least a limited number of their gut microbiota manifest patterns of codiversification (4, 14). We hypothesize that some gut microbiota may be subject to a related process, wherein mammalian evolution associates with the ecologic sorting of bacterial lineages that derived from the same ancestor but which innovated distinct traits that were then subject to selection, phylogenetic redundancy, and conservation among distinct groups of mammals. To explore the existence of such processes, we used parafit (29) to identify 1,171 clades of bacteria that manifest patterns of codiversification with their mammalian hosts (q value < 0.05). Of these, 31 clades were conserved in at least one mammalian order, indicating that some clades may become conserved within a group of mammals and subsequently subject to codiversification processes. This includes clades within Clostridiales, which prior work found to codiversify with mammals (4), as well as a clade within Prevotella. We also found evidence for codiversification of a clade within BS11, which prior work found to be cosmopolitan with respect to ruminants (30), as well as a clade within Burkholderiales, which is known to contain lineages that metabolize toxic dietary xenobiotics such as oxalate (31) (Fig. S2). Moreover, we identified 248 clades that codiversified with mammals and were not themselves conserved among any mammalian order but gave rise to multiple descendant clades that were exclusive to and conserved within distinct orders. For example, we identified a clade within the Bacteroidales that gave rise to a clade conserved among the Artiodactyla as well as a distinct clade that is conserved among the Primates and annotated as being a member of Prevotella (Fig. 3). These results support the hypotheses that at least some anciently integrated members of the mammalian microbiome may have diversified in concert with mammalian evolution and that distinct sets of their descendants can become independently conserved in discrete groups of mammals. Collectively, these findings indicate that the evolution of at least some gut microbiota is linked to the evolution of their mammalian hosts.

To clarify how the gut microbiome diversified in association with human evolution (32), we applied ClaaTU to a deeply sequenced set of gut microbiome samples collected from a large number of hominid individuals. Following procedures reported in reference 33, we combined two large 16S rRNA gene fecal microbiome data sets, one consisting of wild chimpanzees (n = 146), gorillas (n = 177), and bonobos (n = 69) and another consisting of humans from the United States (n = 314), Venezuela (n = 100), and Malawi (n = 114), that were prepared using matched molecular methods (34). We assembled these data into a bacterial phylogeny with 69,517 clades. Due to the rate of biological replication found per host lineage, these data afford accurate resolution of lineage-specific features of the microbiome.

The human gut microbiome dramatically differs from those of other hominids in terms of conserved clades. For example, humans lost a disproportionately large number of hominid conserved clades. Westernized humans exemplify this trend. These clades include members of common human gut genera, such as Prevotella (45 clades), Methanobrevibacter (19 clades), and Bifidobacterium (4 clades) (Fig. S4). Humans also gained conserved clades associated with the genera Bacteroides (64 clades), Bifidobacterium (32 clades), and Ruminococcus (26 clades). These results agree with prior research that indicated that the abundance of Ruminococcus, Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides differentiated nonhuman from human primates (33). Our findings suggest that the evolution of humans is linked to substantial alteration of the factors that impact gut microbiome clade conservation. While the underlying processes driving these patterns are not known, they potentially include (i) interlineage variation in ecology and environment, including differences in shelter and sanitation that could affect microbial metacommunity exposure (38); (ii) genomic evolution, as genotype-microbiome interactions have been described in humans (17); (iii) aspects of behavior or diet that may influence microbial dispersal and growth in the gut; and (iv) cryptic study effects that bias the resolution of microbial lineages in specific host groups. An expanded sampling of primate lineages, across diverse populations, coupled with rich metadata would help determine whether these processes contribute to clade conservation in primates.

Our ecophylogenetic approach offers a new way to uncover discoveries in the study of microbial communities. Determining the appropriate taxonomic rank at which to analyze microbial community data presents a key challenge to investigators. Ranks that are too granular or too broad can overpartition statistical signal or overwhelm it with a level of noise sufficient to eliminate the ability to detect meaningful patterns. To mitigate this problem, our approach integrates across a phylogeny to resolve monophyletic clades at any rank that associate with study (ecologic) covariates, which in the case of the present study included the specific set of mammalian hosts that carried clade members. A key innovation of our approach is the ability to use the phylogenetic tree’s topology to quantify whether the observed associations are likely to have arisen due to chance given the phylogenetic breadth of the clade in question. In the case of the discoveries presented here, this feature enabled the detection of microbial taxa whose nonrandom prevalence among mammals indicates their conservation. Moreover, because our approach relies on detecting statistical patterns that associate with monophyletic clades, it offers a theoretical point of origin for the traits that drive the clade’s distribution across the studied ecosystems (i.e., the common ancestor). While we analyzed a phylogeny assembled from OTU-clustered 16S rRNA gene sequences, our approach is agnostic with respect to the specific tree construction procedure or phylogenetic markers being analyzed. Our method extends prior studies that transformed characterization of microbial communities through consideration of phylogeny (39,–44) and ultimately helps pave the way for phylogenetically informative definitions of microbial taxonomy (45).

The fact that gut microbiotas contribute to mammalian health and behavior motivates efforts to identify gut microbes that influence mammalian fitness or even coevolve with mammals (1, 5, 33, 47). Our finding that conserved clades of gut bacteria phylogenetically sort among mammalian orders and primate species aligns with prior work that links the evolution of mammals to the diversification of their microbiomes (1, 3, 4, 14). However, the underlying driver of this association (e.g., coevolution) remains unclear. Our analytic approach offers a unique theoretical benefit in the effort to resolve the basis for these associations: it integrates the phylogeny of the hosts alongside the phylogeny of their gut microbes, which can clarify the respective orders of host and microbial diversification. For example, our observation of phylogenetic sorting would support a hypothesis of coevolution if the date at which microbial clades diversified cooccurred with the date at which their corresponding mammalian hosts radiated (48). Conversely, we might favor a model wherein selection acts to filter the pool of microbes that contact the host’s gut if the microbial clades in question emerged prior to the corresponding mammalian lineages. Unfortunately, our study’s reliance on 16S rRNA gene sequence data complicates efforts to date microbial divergence times, given that 16S rRNA gene mutation rates can differ greatly across different bacterial lineages, which in turn yields inaccurate divergence time estimates (49, 50). Moreover, while analysis of the 16S rRNA gene locus offers tremendous benefits for microbiome research, its relatively low mutation rate may prevent resolution of cryptic divergences and may thus impact the interpretation of any such test of synchrony. The latter point is especially important with respect to considerations of microbial divergences among recently derived mammalian lineages (14). Researchers performing future work should instead endeavor to leverage phylogenies assembled from shotgun metagenomes (51), where strain-level resolution (52) and genome-wide rates of evolution (53) are discernible. Alternatively, studies should employ the use of universal marker genes that offer more-pronounced insight into evolutionary rates, such as the gyrase B gene (14). Finally, efforts to define local molecular clocks for specific microbial clades, which tend to offer improved accuracy (50), can facilitate clade-specific analyses of synchronous divergence. By applying our approach to the data constructs detailed above, we may ultimately resolve candidate microbial taxa that coevolve with their mammalian hosts. Our investigation aligns with recent efforts to ascribe periods of microbial evolution to the emergence of specific traits (21, 42, 54). In particular, our informatics procedure identified monophyletic clades that contain phylogenetically redundant lineages, indicating that the taxa that comprise the clade contain a trait that arose in the clade’s ancestor or at a prior developmental stage. However, limitations in the phylogenetic breadth of the data analyzed here may result in inaccurate imputation of a trait’s evolutionary origin. Future work should seek to map traits onto comprehensive phylogenies to assess when traits arose and which specific traits are likely contributing to clade conservation. Doing so will consequently facilitate empirical investigations of the role of these traits in the operation of the gut microbiome, microbial dispersal, and host fitness.

We developed ClaaTU (https://github.com/chrisgaulke/Claatu), an algorithm that quantifies the abundance of monophyletic clades of taxa across a set of communities and optionally identifies clades that are more prevalent than expected by chance. ClaaTU conducts a brute force root-to-tip traversal of a phylogenetic tree and quantifies the abundance of each monophyletic clade in each community by summing the abundances of subtending lineages. To determine if a clade is conserved, ClaaTU converts abundances to presence-absence data and then quantifies each clade’s prevalence across a set of samples. To ascertain if the observed prevalence is greater than that expected by chance, ClaaTU conducts a phylogenetic permutation test (44). Specifically, the observed phylogenetic tip-to-community labels are randomly shuffled, such that the underlying prevalence distribution remains fixed, while the associated lineages are altered. This random permutation of the data occurs multiple times (1,000 times for the mammal-wide study and 100 times for the primate study due to limitations of tree size) to produce a bootstrapped prevalence distribution for each clade. A z test determines if the clade’s observed prevalence is significantly greater than the bootstrapped null distribution. ClaaTU assigns a taxonomic label to each clade by identifying the most granular taxonomic assignment shared by all subtending lineages.

We analyzed publicly available data. First, quality-controlled 454 pyrosequenced reads generated from the V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene of stool samples collected from 31 animals representing 10 taxonomic orders (1) were downloaded from MG-RAST (accession no. mgp113 and mgp114). Reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using pick_open_reference_otus.py in QIIME (55) with UCLUST (56) and a 97% identity threshold against the greengenes database (13_8). Taxonomy was inferred for each OTU using assign_taxonomy.py in QIIME with default parameters.

Second, a data set of region V4 16S rRNA gene sequences generated from stool collected from 146 wild chimpanzees, 69 bonobos, and 177 gorillas from several field sites (33) was downloaded from http://web.biosci.utexas.edu/ochman/moeller_data.html and filtered to trim low-quality bases (q value < 25) using split_libraries.py in QIIME. A separate data set of region V4 16S rRNA gene sequences (34) consisting of 528 human sequences—314 of which were from the United States (Western) and 114 and 100 of which were from Malawi and Venezuela, respectively (non-Western)—was downloaded from MG-RAST (accession no. mgp401). Following prior work (33), the nonhuman and human data sets were combined, trimmed to a uniform sequence length of 99 bp, and collectively processed. OTU clustering and taxonomic annotation occurred as described above. The resulting data set was filtered to remove low-frequency OTUs (present in fewer than nine samples) and low-abundance OTUs (total abundance of <10 counts). Using a subset of hominid samples, we determined that the phylogeny produced using QIIME-clustered OTUs highly correlates with a corresponding phylogeny assembled using DADA2, indicating that the results produced using an OTU clustered phylogeny are indicative of those obtained using an exact sequence variance approach (see Text S2 in the supplemental material).

The QIIME-assigned OTU representative sequences were used to assemble phylogenetic trees for each data set. In the case of the primate data, these sequences were combined with the greengenes 97% identity set of full-length reference sequences to improve the phylogenetic accuracy of short-sequence data, following methods described in references 57 and 58. Infernal (59) was used to align sequences as described in references 57 and 58. Alignment columns containing 50% gap characters were removed using filter_alignment.py in QIIME. FastTree was employed to construct phylogenies using a generalized time-reversible model (60). Phylogenies were pruned of greengenes reference sequences and subjected to midpoint rooting and processing by ClaaTU.

Statistical analyses were conducted using R. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was calculated using vegan::vegdist, while vegan::diversity was used to quantify Shannon entropy. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance was used to quantify the association between beta-diversity and categorical sample covariates (vegan::Adonis; 1,000 permutations). To determine if the patterns of microbiome diversity were similar to the evolutionary history of primates, the Bray-Curtis disimilarity matrix was correlated to the phylogenetic distance matrix spanning all pairs of samples using the Mantel function with 1,000 permutations. The hominid phylogeny was obtained from the 10kTrees (version 3) website (https://10ktrees.nunn-lab.org) (61). For all procedures, false-discovery-rate analyses were used to correct multiple tests.
