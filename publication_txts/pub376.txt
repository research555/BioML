A Crosstalk between Diet, Microbiome and microRNA in Epigenetic Regulation of Colorectal Cancer

A still growing interest between human nutrition in relation to health and disease states can be observed. Dietary components shape the composition of microbiota colonizing our gastrointestinal tract which play a vital role in maintaining human health. There is a strong evidence that diet, gut microbiota and their metabolites significantly influence our epigenome, particularly through the modulation of microRNAs. These group of small non-coding RNAs maintain cellular homeostasis, however any changes leading to impaired expression of miRNAs contribute to the development of different pathologies, including neoplastic diseases. Imbalance of intestinal microbiota due to diet is primary associated with the development of colorectal cancer as well as other types of cancers. In the present work we summarize current knowledge with particular emphasis on diet-microbiota-miRNAs axis and its relation to the development of colorectal cancer.

The definition of epigenetics evolved over the centuries. The concept originates in the theory of Aristotle (384–322 BC) who thought that “organs developed in a progressive manner from an originally, undifferentiated homogenous material” [1]. Only in the 17th century the term epigenesis was mentioned by William Harvey as “addition of parts budding out from one another”. Subsequently, in 1940s the term of epigenetics was introduced by the British developmental biologist Conrad Hal Waddington as “inherited changes in phenotype without changes in genotype” [2,3]. At present, epigenetics is defined as a study of reversible and heritable changes in gene expression that modify gene activity and phenotype without any alteration in the DNA sequence. Cooperation and balance between epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, histones modifications, chromatin organization and regulation of gene expression by RNA interference (RNAi) is required for normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms [4]. Particular role in epigenetic regulation seems to be related to micro RNAs (miRNAs), because they not only influence gene expression in epigenetic manner, but can also interact with other epigenetic mechanisms creating important epigenetic link which, when deregulated, can lead to various diseases such as cancer [5]. Each type of epigenetic modification is a dynamic and reversible process which may be affected by genetic and environmental factors such as diet, antibiotics, stress, toxins and microbial metabolites [6]. Microbial bioactive compounds such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), choline metabolites and lipids play a fundamental role in triggering host epigenome locally in the gut, but also distally in the liver, heart and central nervous system [7]. Any deregulation of epigenome affects molecular pathways controlling diverse cellular processes what may lead to cancer development and progression [8] (Figure 1).

Here we focus on the relationship between the dietary metabolism, the gut microbiome and miRNAs expression in cancer, with particular emphasis on colorectal cancer (CRC).

The most common gastrointestinal cancer is CRC which is the 3rd in terms of incidence and 2nd in terms of mortality in 2020 worldwide among malignant neoplasms [15]. According to expectations CRC mortality in Europe for 2020 is 15.4/100,000 men and 8.6 in women [16]. In recent years the tendency of increasing cases was reported among adults younger than 50 years in Europe, USA, New Zealand and Australia [17,18,19]. This trend should be monitored, as current guidelines in Europe recommend screening from the age of 50 and possible changes in screening programs should be adopted in the future [17]. CRC incidence and mortality correlate with economic development of countries. Analysis published by Wong et al. in 2020 shows that CRC incidence and mortality are rising rapidly in countries with middle—to high levels of Human Development Index (HDI), however are stable or even decreasing in the majority of developed countries [20]. The most important factor influencing the prediction of survival is the stage of CRC at the time of diagnosis. The 5-year relative survival rate ranges from 90% for diagnosis with localized disease to 14% for patients with distant-stage disease [21].

The most important molecular pathways underlying a multi-step carcinogenic process involve chromosomal instability (CIN), microsatellite instability (MSI) and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) [37]. MiRNAs are also mentioned among various genetic and epigenetic mechanisms implicated in CRC development [38]. The discovery of the RNAi was a milestone achievement in understanding the mechanism of regulation of gene expression. This process involves small RNAs such as siRNA and miRNA, with a length shorter than 30 bp that controls the expression of protein-coding genes in the various eukaryotic organisms [39]. The function of miRNA is to negatively regulate the expression of genes through binding to the target mRNA resulting in transcriptional repression, mRNA degradation or both [40]. The function of miRNA depends on the degree of miRNA-mRNA complementarity [41]. A fully complementary miRNA-mRNA promotes AGO-mediated mRNA degradation through its slicing by AGO2, but not fully complementary interactions lead to the repression of translation and mRNA decay which is caused by most of the miRNAs in animal cells [42,43]. The development of CRC as transformation of normal epithelial cells to adenomatous polyps and then cancer is a progressive process under control of different molecular pathways: Wnt, MAPK, PI3K/Akt, TGF-ß, JAK/STAT, NF-κB, aberrant cell cycle and apoptosis which are also regulated by miRNAs [37,44]. In cancer, deregulated miRNAs act as oncogenic miRNAs (oncomirs) or tumor suppressors, where oncomirs that inhibit tumor suppressor proteins are overexpressed, and suppressor miRNAs that regulate expression of oncoproteins are downregulated or even deleted [45]. Potentially mimics of suppressor miRNAs or oncomir inhibitors may be used for therapeutic purposes in CRC what was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo [46,47,48,49,50,51]. Examples of recently published oncomirs and suppressor miRNAs together with their direct targets and effects in CRC are presented in Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).

Human microbiome includes at least 1000 different species of known bacteria with more than 3 million genes involved in many vital functions such as digestion of carbohydrates, competition with pathogens, vitamin synthesis, immune system activity and drug metabolism.

It is now established that some distinctive members of the microbiota are involved in carcinogenesis. Helicobacter pylori is the most common example considered by WHO as group I carcinogen, which causes gastric cancer [70]. It was shown that H. pylori infection stimulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration of gastric epithelial cells through inducing miR-29a-3p expression [71]. Other bacteria such as Fusobacterium spp. or an increased abundance of Escherichia coli may be involved in the pathogenesis of CRC [72,73]. The majority of the research in this subject has focused on the relationship between gut microbiota and CRC and they have shown that alterations in gut bacteria have been associated with the development of the cancer. It was found by Arthur et al. [74] that colitis-susceptible interleukin-10 (IL-10) deficient mice infected with E. coli NC101 had decreased number of microorganisms and microbial diversity indicating a putative difference in the gut microbiota between sick and healthy individuals and more often developed invasive CRC after azoxymethane (AMO) treatment. Moreover, other studies on stool samples in human patients showed that alterations in the gut microbiota are possible to be associated with adenomas and carcinomas, where specific species were more and other were less frequent [75]. For example, CRC risk was associated with decreased bacterial diversity in stool with depletion of Gram-positive, fiber-fermenting clostridia. The increased presence of Gram-negative, proinflammatory genera Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas suggests a role of inflammation in microbial change in the gut [76]. F. nucleatum has been associated with CRC. Numerous studies have shown that anaerobic Gram-negative pathogenic mechanism leading to Fusobacterium-related CRC concerns on invasion and adhesion to the epithelial cells by proteins FadA, Fap2 and RadD expressed by bacteria [77]. It was demonstrated that F. nucleatum adheres to and invades CRC cells through unique FadA adhesin that stimulates oncogenic and inflammatory responses and proliferation. FadA binds to E-cadherin, activates β-catenin signaling and induces expression of oncogenes, including miRNAs that promote CRC growth [72,78]. In addition, it was shown that FadA modulates Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway by activation of Annexin-1 (ANXA1) expression through E-cadherin, and ANXA1 expression is increased only in proliferating CRC cells, but not in non-proliferating and non-cancerous cells [79]. Moreover, recently it was shown that Fusobacterium is significantly involved in the proliferation and migration of CRC cells in vitro by direct induction of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 protein and the activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway [80]. FadA may also bind to the vascular endothelial cadherins (VE-cadherin) increasing endothelial cells permeability allowing bacteria to penetrate through endothelium, overcome blood-brain and placental barrier and colonize the distant parts of the human body [81]. The inverse ratio, when the number of Bifidobacterium is significantly decreased and E. coli increased is a dysbiosis associated with CRC. It was shown that subjects exposed to a high-risk diet but with increasing levels of bifidobacteria over E. coli have a significantly lower CRC risk [82]. Microbiota-mediated metabolic activities can contribute to CRC development via production of pro-carcinogenic compounds such as polyamine [83,84,85,86]. The same process is caused by the production of genotoxins and DNA-damaging superoxide radicals by Enterococcus faecalis [87].

Environmental factors, disease state, age, host genetics and diet are factors shaping gut microbiota and vice versa, intestinal flora plays a role in the pathophysiology of host diseases through affecting gene and protein expression, and also through their specific metabolites [88]. Diet influences the amount and types of bacteria present in the gut [89,90,91]. It was demonstrated that children with diet rich in fiber from fruits, vegetables and whole grains are more likely to have more diverse and numerous microbes than children with diet consisting of more processed food [89]. In turn, Western diet which is characterized by a high content of protein, sugar, saturated fats, refined grains, alcohol, salt, high-fructose corn syrup and low in fiber reduces microbial diversity [92]. Westernized diets considered as pro-inflammatory diets induce microbial dysbiosis, where Fusobacterium spp., adherent-invasive E. coli and Enterobacter spp. are increased. On the other hand, amount of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phylla Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia hominis, Bifidobacterium spp. and Prevotella spp. is decreased [93]. Plant-based diet as anti-inflammatory diet show opposite effects and increase Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobaccilus spp. abundance at the expense of Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens [94]. Recent findings suggest that the intake of foxtail millet attenuates colonic inflammation and reduces the risk of AMO and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis-associated CRC in mouse model. Millet-treatment also increases the abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Bacteroidales_S-24-7 [95]. Gut flora helps maintain our health by controlling intestinal homeostasis, epithelial function, development of immune system and numerous additional functions of this organ [96]. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, the main phyla of bacteria inhabiting the intestine, have enzymes that degrade complex dietary substrates [68]. Degradation of macronutrients initiates fermentation, which produces weak acids such as acetate lowering intestinal pH with impact to microbiota composition and host health [68]. Commensal gut microbiota and their metabolites can either promote carcinogenic signaling or serve tumor suppressive functions by digesting and converting dietary nutrients to secondary metabolites [97,98,99]. The regulation of various components of “gut-brain axis”, “gut-liver axis” and gut-lung axis” through the impact on inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides production can affect the epigenome through metabolism of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), vitamin synthesis and nutrient absorption. Only a few microbial metabolites, including folate, phenolic acids, S-(−) equol, urolithins, isothiocyanates, short- and long-chain fatty acids have been tested with respect to their potential to influence epigenetic mechanisms [100].

Fasting as abstinence from all solid food for a period of time is a dieting approach with beneficial effects for health [144]. One of the main mechanisms by which fasting induces metabolic improvements is mediated by the gut microbiota [145]. Increasing the levels of Firmicutes while decreasing most other phyla and rising the production of SCFAs accordingly in every-other day fasting animals when compared to control animals were observed. Food abstinence decreases the abundance of potentially pathogenic Proteobacteria while increasing Akkermansia muciniphila levels [146]. The effect of periodic fasting on the human gut microbiota, SIRTs expression and mitochondrial content in 51 males and females were analysed by Lilja et al. [147]. Periodic fasting triggered a significant switch in metabolism, as indicated by the increase in ß-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4) expression in the capillary blood. MtDNA, SIRT1, SIRT3 and miR-let-7b-5p expression in blood cells were elevated. Following fasting, gut microbiota diversity increased and a statistically significant correlation between SIRT1 gene expression and the abundance of Prevotella spp. and Lactobacillus spp. was detected. SIRT1, along with histone deacetylation, regulates transcription factors, such as p53 [148], and DNA repair proteins, such as poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) [149] being a protection from a wide array of metabolic and age-related diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.

Many reports present that microbiota affects host miRNAs expression. These miRNAs play a role in physiologic process such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, but their deregulation leads to pathologies including cancer [33]. Aberrantly expressed miRNAs influence molecular changes leading to initiation, development and progression of the tumor [33,150]. Development of CRC is the effect of the decline of butyrate-producing bacteria and increasement of detrimental bacterial populations [151]. Butyrate represents anti-CRC effects through regulation of miRNAs. SCFAs content is significantly diminished in plasma of patients with CRC, and this confirms the fact that lower SCFAs levels promotes CRC progression [152]. In vitro butyrate lowers the expression of oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster members, including miR-92a, miR-17, miR-19a/b, miR-20. It was caused by lowering the expression of c-Myc that reduces c-Myc recruitment on miR-17-92a promoter [153]. As transcription factor, c-Myc regulates expression of genes and influences the characteristics of colon cancer stem cells; its role in CRC was confirmed by genetic ablation in mouse models that promotes tumorigenesis [154]. Earlier research results showed that butyrate in CRC cell lines reduces the level of c-Myc at different stages: by suppression of mRNA transcription, acceleration of mRNA degradation and inhibition of mRNA splicing that leads to suppression of transcription of oncogenic pri-miR-17-92, precursor and mature miR-92a [153]. In consequence, expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (CDKN1C; p57) is increased which induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of CRC in vitro [153]. In CRC p57 is considered as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulated expression is due to hypermethylation of promoter through increased activity of methyltransferase DNMT3a [155].

The summary of relationships between diet, gut microbiota, bacterial metabolites, miRNAs and their influence on CRC pathogenesis is presented in Table 1.

A conventional nutritional approach with application of a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains to balance the gut microbiota may improve health outcomes in individuals with cancer. Transformation of dietary compounds by the gut microbiome may influence epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression as an additional environmental factor. In the human colon microbial metabolites may produce immediate effect, while simultaneously many of them, after absorption into systemic circulation, may alter gene expression in regions distal to the gut. Integration of dietary intake, examination of the gut microbiome and epigenome markers in human population surveys are needed to understand the influence of these environmental factors on human health. Eran Elinav [204] envision the future of cancer care as involving a holistic treatment approach personalized to patient genetic and microbiome characteristics. Undoubtedly, involvement of gut microbiota species in carcinogenesis or in modulation of treatment efficacy is a major premise for new interventions altering microbiota composition and function.
