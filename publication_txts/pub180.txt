Calorie restriction improves metabolic state independently of gut microbiome composition: a randomized dietary intervention trial

The gut microbiota has been suggested to play a significant role in the development of overweight and obesity. However, the effects of calorie restriction on gut microbiota of overweight and obese adults, especially over longer durations, are largely unexplored.

Here, we longitudinally analyzed the effects of intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) operationalized as the 5:2 diet versus continuous calorie restriction (CCR) on fecal microbiota of 147 overweight or obese adults in a 50-week parallel-arm randomized controlled trial, the HELENA Trial. The primary outcome of the trial was the differential effects of ICR versus CCR on gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Changes in the gut microbiome, which are the focus of this publication, were defined as exploratory endpoint of the trial. The trial comprised a 12-week intervention period, a 12-week maintenance period, and a final follow-up period of 26 weeks.

Both diets resulted in ~5% weight loss. However, except for Lactobacillales being enriched after ICR, post-intervention microbiome composition did not significantly differ between groups. Overall weight loss was associated with significant metabolic improvements, but not with changes in the gut microbiome. Nonetheless, the abundance of the Dorea genus at baseline was moderately predictive of subsequent weight loss (AUROC of 0.74 for distinguishing the highest versus lowest weight loss quartiles). Despite the lack of consistent intervention effects on microbiome composition, significant study group-independent co-variation between gut bacterial families and metabolic biomarkers, anthropometric measures, and dietary composition was detectable. Our analysis in particular revealed associations between insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR) and Akkermansiaceae, Christensenellaceae, and Tanerellaceae. It also suggests the possibility of a beneficial modulation of the latter two intestinal taxa by a diet high in vegetables and fiber, and low in processed meat.

Overall, our results suggest that the gut microbiome remains stable and highly individual-specific under dietary calorie restriction.

The trial, including the present microbiome component, was prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.govNCT02449148 on May 20, 2015.

Obesity is an important risk factor for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and several types of cancer [1]. Aside from well-established mechanisms such as obesity-induced inflammation, alterations in sugar and lipid metabolism, and steroid hormone signaling [2–4], imbalances in the composition of the gut microbiome have also been linked to the progression of obesity and its cardio-metabolic sequelae [5]. Obesity has been associated with a lower abundance of gut bacteria in the Bacteroidetes phylum, in contrast to a higher abundance of Firmicutes [5]. Furthermore, gut bacteria-dependent turnover of metabolites, e.g., short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) [6], secondary bile acids [7], trimethylamine-N-Oxide (TMAO) [8] or amino acids [9], acting locally or systemically, may mediate the links between the gut microbiome, obesity, and obesity-associated chronic diseases.

While mixed results have been reported from the abovementioned studies on different types of continuous calorie restriction (CCR) and the microbiome, intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) has recently been shown to improve several health outcomes in animal models, possibly via effects on the microbiome [17–21]. However, despite these promising findings from animal models and first smaller studies among humans [13], there is a lack of well-powered trials on ICR in relation to the microbiome. Thus, in the present study, we investigated whether ICR (operationalized as the 5:2 diet) or CCR induced alterations in the gut microbiome and to which extent these were associated with overall weight loss irrespective of the dietary intervention in overweight or obese adults. To this end, we analyzed repeated fecal samples over 1 year, i.e., at baseline, 12, 24, and 50 weeks with 16S rRNA gene sequencing and also performed repeated targeted profiling of gut microbiome-related metabolites in the circulation. This study was conducted using data and samples of the HELENA Trial (NCT02449148), a randomized controlled trial undertaken to compare the metabolic effects of ICR vs. CCR [22].

The protocol of the HELENA Trial, a parallel-arm randomized controlled trial which included a 12-week controlled intervention phase with additional dietary counselling, followed by a 12-week maintenance phase (week 24) and a final observational follow-up phase of 26 weeks (week 50) (Fig.
1) has previously been published [23]. Briefly, the trial recruited 150 overweight or obese (BMI > 25 and < 40 kg/m2), non-smoking adults (age range 35–65 years, 50% women), free of any gastrointestinal tract diseases as well as major chronic diseases such as CVD or diabetes in Heidelberg, Germany, in 2015. Recruitment was carried out from 6th May, 2015, to 17th May, 2016. At the time of enrolment, none of the participants were taking antibiotics. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups, i.e., an intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) (n = 49), a continuous calorie restriction (CCR) (n = 49), or a control group (CTR) (n = 52) over a 50-week period in a 1:1:1 ratio. Overall, fecal samples were obtained from 147 participants at baseline (Fig.
1). In the ICR group, participants reduced calorie intake by ~75% on two non-consecutive days of the week (so-called “5:2 diet”) whereas those in the CCR group reduced daily calorie intake by 20% [22]. All participants (ICR, CCR, and CTR) were advised to adhere to the dietary recommendations of the German Nutrition Society (DGE e.V.), i.e., 55% energy from carbohydrates, 15% from protein, and 30% from fat [24]. The results on the effects of ICR vs. CCR vs. CTR with respect to the pre-specified primary endpoints, i.e., changes in the expression of 82 pre-selected genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), as well as secondary endpoints, i.e., anthropometric, body composition, and routine metabolic blood biomarkers, have already been published [22]. There were no differential effects of ICR and CCR [22]. The present analyses on changes in clinical parameters (secondary endpoints) as well as microbiome and metabolites (exploratory endpoints) across the initial trial arms and by overall weight loss were pre-specified in the study protocol of the HELENA Trial [23]. However, all exploratory analyses of the gut microbiome beyond the comparisons across trial arms and weight-loss quartiles had a post hoc character.﻿ These analyses include (i) association tests of gut microbial families with body composition, clinical markers, and dietary intake, (ii) the prediction of subsequent weight loss from baseline microbiome features, as well as (iii) comparisons of microbiome data from the Helena Trial with that from published studies. The ethics committee of the Heidelberg University Hospital (Heidelberg, Germany, Reference: vote S299-2014) as well as the EMBL Bioethics Advisory Committee (Reference: 2020-022) approved the trial, which was designed and conducted in agreement with the principles of the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki [25]. All participants signed informed consent forms before enrolment. The trial, including the present microbiome component, was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02449148).

Dietary intake was assessed using food records for 7 consecutive days. Information on the time and location of food intake, portion sizes, and details on the characteristics of the meals/foods consumed were obtained with the 7-day food records [22]. Pictured portion size books were provided to all study participants in order to aid with portion size estimation. Energy and nutrient intake were analyzed based on the German Nutrient Database (Bundeslebensmittelschlüssel, version 3.02) using the software PRODI 6.8 (Nutri-Science GmbH, Hausach, Germany). Daily energy and nutrient intake were estimated as the averages of all reported days [22].

Measurements of routine metabolic biomarkers were carried out at the central laboratory of the Heidelberg University Hospital by clinical standard assays right after fasting blood sampling at baseline, and after 12, 24, and 50 weeks after the start of the trial. Fasting blood samples were subsequently aliquoted and immediately stored at − 80 °C at the Biobank of the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany, until further biochemical analyses. The concentrations of routine blood-based biomarkers such as LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, GGT, ALT, AST, and of serum biomarkers (adiponectin, CRP, IL-8, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNFα, resistin, leptin, insulin, IGF-1) were measured as described in detail previously [22]. The collection of all biospecimens, and subsequent biochemical analyses in the HELENA Trial was conducted in line with standard operating procedures [22].

The concentrations of bile acids were measured at the Analytical Unit of the Health Research Institute Hospital La Fe (Valencia, Spain) by means of a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography/multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry (UPLC-MRM-MS) method, details of which have already been published [30]. Liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to measure TMAO, betaine, and choline levels in plasma at the Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Zurich (Zurich, Switzerland) as described previously [31].

Fecal samples were collected from participants at four different time points, i.e., baseline and weeks 12, 24, and 50 into sterile RNAlater™-filled tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) and stored at − 80°C at the Biobank of the National Center for Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg, Germany, until DNA extraction. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from fecal samples according to the manufacturer’s protocol using the AllPrep® PowerFaecal® DNA/RNA Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). DNA from all fecal samples belonging to the same participant were extracted in the same run. In brief, approximately 200 mg of feces were added to lysis tubes containing glass beads and a lysis buffer. The tubes were then put into a Precellys® 24 Homogenizer (Bertin instruments, France) for mechanical bacterial cell lysis, which was performed twice—45 s each with an intermediate incubation period of 5 min. Genomic DNA was bound to silica membranes in spin columns, washed, and finally eluted into 1.5-ml tubes after a final incubation period of 1 min. The Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer with broad range assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) was used to quantify DNA concentrations (ng/μl) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA was immediately stored at − 20 °C until further analyses.

In the first stage of a two-stage PCR protocol, the V4 region of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene was targeted for selective PCR amplification using V4 region-specific 16S rRNA primers 515F (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 806R (GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) [32]. For each DNA sample, a volume of 3 μl (~ 10 ng) was used as a template in a total PCR volume of 12 μl in the first-stage PCR with conditions of an initial denaturation step at 98 °C for 2 min, followed by 20 cycles of a three-step process comprising (i) denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s (ii) annealing at 65 °C for 20 s (iii) extension 72 °C for 20 s. The first-stage PCR ended with a final extension step at 72 °C for 2 min.

The success of amplification of each sample was assessed by visualization of bands on a 2.5% agarose gel against a 100-bp ladder. Samples that did not amplify were repeated, after which all samples were pooled. A clean-up of the pool was performed with SPRIselect® magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter Inc., USA), using 0.8 left side size selection according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cleaned pool was again quantified using the Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer with high sensitivity assay. The Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer® system (Agilent Technologies, USA) was used to assess the average size distribution, the quality, and again the concentration of the pooled sample. Afterwards, a 2 × 250 paired-end sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was carried out on the Illumina Miseq platform (Illumina, Inc., USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions as previously outlined [33]. Sequencing was performed in two batches, but all samples from the same participant were sequenced in the same batch. The library preparation and 16S rRNA gene sequencing for a selection of the samples were performed twice for the technical validation of both steps (Fig.
2d). Library preparation and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were carried out at the Genomics Core Facility of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg.

After sequencing, the raw sequence reads were demultiplexed based on their unique primer barcode identifiers using MiSeq instrument software and prepared for further downstream processing and analysis. The demultiplexed sequence reads were processed with DADA2 (Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm), a tool able to identify the original sequences that generated the observed 16S sequences, known as amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) [34]. Using DADA2, raw sequence reads were quality filtered and denoised, after which paired-end reads were merged, and chimeric sequences discarded. A total of 13,767,541 reads were generated after Miseq paired-end sequencing, and 11,546,617 reads remained after filtering, denoising and chimeric sequences removal. The reads were grouped into amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) based on sequence similarity, and subsequently rarefied/subsampled to an equal depth of 5000 sequences per sample. This was performed to account for variability in sequencing depth. Only three samples were excluded after rarefaction. Standard quality control checks identified a probable case of sample swap involving 2 samples, which was resolved by relabeling based on Euclidean distance clustering of the samples (Additional File 1: Figure S1).

Prevotella-to-Bacteroides ratio (P/B ratio) was calculated as the summed relative abundance of the ASVs that map to Prevotella (“Prevotella”, “Prevotella_2,” etc.), divided by the cumulative relative abundance of the ASVs that map to the Bacteroides genus in Silva. In cases where the sum of Prevotella was zero, the P/B ratio was set to 1/10,000. The P/B ratio was set to 10,000 when the sum of Bacteroides relative abundances was zero. Lastly, when the sum of both Prevotella and Bacteroides relative abundances was zero, the P/B ratio was set to 1. We subsequently applied a log10 transformation to improve visualization and compared the P/B ratio across intervention groups and also assessed the association of P/B ratio with weight loss.

Data for continuous variables, including changes, are presented as means ± SEM (standard error of the mean), and as frequencies and/or percentages for categorical variables. Relative changes in body composition and in the concentrations of clinical biomarkers and circulating metabolites from baseline to each post-intervention phase, i.e., weeks 12, 24, and 50 were calculated across the initial intervention groups (ICR, CCR, and CTR). Differential changes in metabolite concentrations between the intervention groups at each time point were assessed using linear mixed effect (LME) models. The LME model included age, sex, time, intervention group, and a time-by-intervention interaction term, with participants’ identifier or subject ID set as the random effect. Differences between the intervention groups with respect to changes in the outcomes of interest were considered significant at p < 0.05 for the time-by-intervention interaction effect. When the overall time-by-intervention effect was significant, pairwise comparisons were performed, again using LME models as described.

All statistical analyses were carried out using R statistical software [41].

Overall, 147 participants (74 men and 73 women), out of the 150 enrolled, provided fecal samples at baseline (ICR, n = 49, CCR, n = 46, CTR, n = 52) (Fig.
1, see also Fig.
2), indicative of high compliance at baseline, which was also observed at subsequent timepoints. Their mean age at baseline was 50.3 ± 7.9 years, with an average BMI of 31.4 ± 3.7 kg/m2 across all groups (Table
1, see also Additional file 2: Table S1 for further baseline characteristics).

Consistent with randomization, there was no significant difference in the relative abundance of bacteria between the intervention groups (ICR vs CCR vs CTR) at baseline (Kruskal-Wallis test; FDR-corrected p-value, i.e., q value > 0.05 for individual bacteria at all taxonomic levels, for bacterial classes see Fig.
2b). Expectedly, overall gut microbiome composition was dominated mainly by two bacterial classes: Clostridia followed by Bacteroidia (Fig.
2b), which belong to the two most abundant phyla of gut microbiota, i.e., Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, respectively [42].

Both ICR and CCR interventions, compared to CTR, resulted in significantly greater reductions in weight over the course of the intervention (Fig.
2a). In contrast, gut microbiome composition remained relatively stable and ICR and CCR did not induce major changes (Fig.
2b). Beta diversity analysis (quantifying between-sample differences) using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity on amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) did not reveal any clustering by intervention groups after 12 weeks (Fig.
2c), as is apparent from visualizations based on non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) (Fig.
2c, PERMANOVA p = 0.12). Consistent with this finding, beta diversity at later time points (week 24 and week 50) was not significantly affected by the intervention either (Additional file 1: Figure S2). Likewise, we did not observe an intervention effect on the Prevotella-to-Bacteroides ratio (P/B ratio) (Additional file 1: Figure S3).

Instead, we found microbiome composition to primarily vary between individuals irrespective of intervention group. Consistent with previous observational microbiome studies [40, 43], inter-individual differences were substantially higher than intra-individual differences between samples taken from the same subject (Fig.
2d). We moreover observed a slow, but significant, decrease in intra-individual similarity in gut microbiome composition over time (Fig.
2d). However, inter-individual differences between versus within study groups were insignificant (Fig.
2d). Similar to our findings on beta diversity, the relative changes in gut microbiome alpha diversity, assessed by the Shannon index, were not significantly different between the intervention groups at any of the time points either (Fig.
2e, see also Additional file 2: Table S3).

When assessing changes in the relative abundances of individual bacterial taxa over time, we only found the order Lactobacillales to be significantly increased in the ICR group, in contrast to marginal decreases in both the CCR and CTR (Additional file 2: Table S4) right after the intervention period (Fig.
3a). This increase in the ICR group was still detectable for the class of Bacilli, to which it belongs (Additional file 2: Table S5). At lower taxonomic ranks within Lactobacillales, the family Streptococcaceae showed the strongest change after 12 weeks (q = 0.12), with median relative changes (25th–75th percentile) of 0.62 (− 0.12,0.89) vs. 0.00 (− 0.56,0.46) vs. 0.00 (-0.51,0.42) for ICR vs. CCR vs. CTR respectively (see also Additional file 2: Table S14).

With respect to circulating metabolites, we did not observe significant effects of the interventions on the concentrations of plasma bile acids, most amino acids, and acylcarnitines as well as TMAO and its precursors across timepoints, consistent with the lack of significant effects of the interventions on gut microbiome composition in our study.

To assess whether the potential metabolic improvements that may accompany dietary weight loss were linked to the gut microbiome, we investigated the effect of overall weight loss, irrespective of the dietary regimen, on plasma concentrations of routine biomarkers as well as gut microbiome composition and concentrations of microbial-related metabolites in circulation. Weight loss was strongly associated with variations in body composition parameters such as visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and liver and pancreatic fat after 12 and 50 weeks (Fig.
4a). Moreover, we found highly significant metabolic improvements associated with weight loss: established biomarkers of lipid metabolism (cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and leptin), liver, and kidney function (ALT and GGT) as well as cardiovascular health (thrombocytes and E-selectin as well as blood pressure) were all positively linearly associated with weight loss (Fig.
4a, d–i and Additional file 2: Table S6).

When jointly analyzing factors influencing gut microbiome composition, we found baseline microbial abundance to account for the largest proportion of variance in post-intervention abundances by far, with only minimal contributions from intervention group, weight loss, and other sources investigated (as illustrated for bacteria at the phylum level in Fig.
4j). The absence of observable shifts over time due to both intervention and weight loss was further confirmed by ordination analysis revealing predominant clustering by individuals (Additional file 1: Figure S5).

When exploring in more detail if baseline microbial features would be predictive of post-intervention weight loss, we observed the abundance of Dorea at baseline, as the only one among all genera tested, to significantly differ among participants in the lowest compared to the highest quartile of weight loss after 12 weeks (FDR-corrected p = 0.013, Fig.
5a). Low Dorea abundance at baseline was moderately predictive of weight loss after 12 weeks when evaluated as a predictive biomarker for classifying participants into the lowest versus the highest weight loss quartiles with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.74 (Fig.
5b). Predictive accuracy remained similar when evaluated against weight loss at later time points (Figure S6). We further compared Dorea abundance to other biomarkers proposed earlier as predictors of weight loss, such as the Prevotella-to-Bacteroides (P/B) ratio, or gut microbiota richness [46]. However, neither the P/B ratio (AUROC: 0.56) nor microbiota richness (AUROC: 0.54) were predictive of weight loss in the HELENA Trial (Fig.
5b). We further investigated whether lower Dorea abundance at baseline would also be associated with higher weight loss in an independent dataset (Fig.
5c) collected by Grembi et al. [40] in a dietary intervention study with participant characteristics similar to ours. Also in this external data set, we observed a similar association (Pearson’s r = 0.21 compared to 0.27 in the Helena Trial), which however did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.13) (Fig.
5c). We finally also investigated whether gut microbiota plasticity, as proposed by Grembi et al. and defined as the variability in the gut microbiota composition estimated with a β-diversity metric [40], was associated with weight loss. As multiple pre-intervention microbiome samples were not available in the Helena Trial, we assessed Bray-Curtis dissimilarity-based plasticity between baseline and week 12, i.e., T0–T1 as a predictor of long-term weight loss (i.e., at week 50). In contrast to Dorea baseline abundance, microbiota plasticity was not predictive of long-term weight loss in the Helena Trial (AUROC: 0.56, Figure S6).

Even though we did not observe significant longitudinal changes in gut microbial abundances between intervention or weight loss groups, our study was uniquely powered to identify changes in gut microbiota associated with anthropometric, dietary, clinical, and metabolic biomarkers of obesity and early-stage metabolic syndrome when assessed irrespectively of intervention type. To leverage both the longitudinal sampling and the large number of participants, we subjected gut bacterial families to analysis with linear mixed effect (LME) models [38], which can reveal linear co-variation across timepoints that is consistent across study participants (Fig.
6a, see also Additional file 1: Figure S7 and Methods). Additionally, we also constructed LME models with the weight loss quartiles as a modifying effect, which revealed a subset of associations between bacterial families and clinical biomarkers to be of different strength across weight loss groups (Fig.
6a,b). This analysis showed Akkermansiaceae, the only member of the Verrucomicrobia phylum found in the human gut, to be inversely correlated with established biomarkers of metabolic dysfunction, namely insulin, HOMA-IR, and triglyceride concentrations (Fig.
6a,c–d). Our data also showed Christensenellaceae to be inversely associated with weight and metabolic indicators of (pre-) diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. Specifically, we found this bacterial family to be anti-correlated with BMI, VAT, liver fat, HOMA-IR, and blood concentrations of triglycerides, and cholesterol (Fig.
6a, e–g). Marinifilaceae and Rikenellaceae, which positively correlated with Christensenellaceae, were also inversely associated with VAT. In contrast to Akkermansiaceae and Christensenellaceae, we observed the abundance of Tannerellaceae to be positively associated with HOMA-IR (Fig.
6a, h). Beyond biomarkers of lipid and sugar metabolism, our analyses also uncovered interesting covariation between gut microbial families (especially Peptostreptococcaceae, but also Christensenellaceae and Marinifilaceae) and metabolic indicators of liver damage, i.e., ALT and AST, which are biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

The majority of the described associations between bacteria, metabolic biomarkers, and questionnaire-derived dietary items were not differential depending on weight loss over time (Fig.
6b). Nevertheless, a few associations showed heterogeneity across weight loss quartiles in LME models, with stronger correlations between Christensenellaceae and both HOMA-IR and energy intake, and between Tannerellaceae and fiber intake, among individuals in the highest weight loss quartile (Fig.
6f–g, i, see also Additional file 1: Figure S7 and “Methods”).

Many studies showing intriguing plasticity in gut microbiome composition in response to dietary changes [47–49] have raised the question of whether intestinal microbiota mediate some of the physiological effects of such interventions. In particular, understanding whether the health benefits of weight loss achieved through calorie restriction are linked to changes in the gut microbiome and its metabolites would open up possibilities for optimizing dietary interventions for intestinal microbiome modulation. Thus, we conducted the first study to longitudinally evaluate gut microbiome composition and metabolite changes following calorie restriction among 147 overweight or obese adults (non-smokers free of any gastrointestinal or chronic diseases) over 1 year in a randomized controlled dietary intervention trial. Notwithstanding significant improvements in body composition and several metabolic parameters, the type of calorie restriction, or the amount of weight lost were not accompanied by substantial and consistent shifts in gut microbiome composition or the abundance of individual bacterial taxa.

We found a few cases of heterogeneity across quartiles of weight loss in the associations between bacteria, metabolic biomarkers, and food intakes in integrated LME analyses of repeated measurements. However, while our analysis of intervention outcomes suggests that they cannot be easily manipulated by calorie restriction alone, their associations with food components, such as vegetables or processed meat, highlight the promise of future dietary intervention studies; based on our post hoc observations, such studies could attempt to specifically modulate these bacterial families while monitoring concomitant metabolic changes. Together with randomized controlled trials of bacterial supplementation [74], these could help to untangle causality and to achieve weight loss and its associated metabolic benefits not only through direct effects on the host, but also through synergistic modulation of the gut microbiota and its metabolic products.

In conclusion, our findings suggest that moderate ICR or CCR interventions as well as an overall moderate weight loss induced by calorie restriction (irrespective of which form) may not be associated with significant changes in the gut microbiome of overweight and obese adults, notwithstanding observed metabolic improvements. Nevertheless, baseline microbiome composition, in particular Dorea, was moderately predictive of intervention outcome in our study, but further work is needed to independently validate this in comparison to other proposed predictors of weight loss. Despite the lack of consistent intervention effects on microbiome composition, LME model analysis, which leveraged data across all time points and participants, while also accounting for weight loss, revealed several significant and plausible associations of gut bacteria with anthropometric measurements, body composition indices, and biomarkers of metabolic health.
