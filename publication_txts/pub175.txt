Gut Microbiome Modulation for Preventing and Treating Pediatric Food Allergies

The increasing prevalence and severity of pediatric food allergies (FA) demands innovative preventive and therapeutic strategies. Emerging evidence suggests a pivotal role for the gut microbiome in modulating susceptibility to FA. Studies have demonstrated that alteration of gut microbiome could precede FA, and that particular microbial community structures early in life could influence also the disease course. The identification of gut microbiome features in pediatric FA patients is driving new prevention and treatment approaches. This review is focused on the potential role of the gut microbiome as a target for FA prevention and treatment.

In the past two decades, the prevalence, persistence, and severity of food allergies (FA) have been increasing [1]. This has led to an increased number of hospitalizations and costs for patients, their families, and healthcare systems [2]. Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain such phenomenon. Among these, the current “old friends and biodiversity hypotheses” propose that changes in living environment, diet, and lifestyle associated with Westernized countries have altered the microbial diversity, disrupting the immunoregulatory function of the microbiome and predisposing people to allergic sensitization [3,4,5]. The formulation of these hypotheses derives from robust evidence suggesting a key role of microbiome alteration, influenced by modern lifestyle factors, in the development of FA [6]. The purpose of this review is to present an overview of the current knowledge on the role of the gut microbiome as an innovative target of interventions against FA.

Growing evidence from human and animal studies supports a crucial role of gut dysbiosis, a state of imbalance in the gut microbial ecosystem, in FA development.

The first studies highlighting different gut microbiome structures in subjects with FA were culture-based investigations, but this type of study was able to provide only partial results, as most of the microbiota could not be cultured [7,8]. For this reason, subsequent studies used other techniques, such as 16S rRNA sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, both based on next-generation sequencing technology, which enable more comprehensive and culture-free profiling of taxa in a given sample [9]. Unfortunately, shotgun metagenomic sequencing has not yet been widely implemented in studies with FA. Findings from 16S rRNA sequencing-based studies have shown that children with FA have a distinct gut microbiome structure compared with those without FA (Table 1).

FA: food allergy; FS: food sensitization; OTUs: operational taxonomic units; N.R.: not reported; ↑: increase; ↓: decrease; =: unchanged.

The available data from human studies suggest that dysbiosis precedes FA onset. Nakayama et al. profiled the fecal bacteria compositions in allergic and nonallergic infants and correlated some changes in gut microbiome composition with allergy development in later years [23]. Azad et al. found that an increased Enterobacteriaceae/Bacteroidaceae ratio and low Ruminococcaceae abundance, in the context of low gut microbiome richness in early infancy, are associated with subsequent food sensitization, suggesting that early gut dysbiosis contributes to subsequent development of FA [11]. Moreover, the available data from human studies suggest that:

Data from animal studies provide interesting insights on the importance of gut microbiome in FA. Mice treated with antibiotics showed a predisposition to allergy development [24]. Similarly, germ-free mice do not develop immune tolerance and maintain a Th2 immune response to orally administered antigen [25,26,27]. This effect can be corrected by the reconstitution of the microbiome early in life, but not at later ages. These findings document a decisive role of the gut microbiome in the acquisition of immune tolerance to food antigens. Indeed, an early state of eubiosis allows for a change in the lymphocyte Th1/Th2 balance, favoring a Th1 cell response; while dysbiosis alters the host–microbiome homeostasis, producing a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance toward a Th2 immune response and a consequent activation of Th2 cytokines with an increased IgE production [28]. Interestingly, the gut microbiome is also able to transmit susceptibility to FA. In a mouse model susceptible to FA, because of a gain-of-function mutation in the IL-4 receptor, investigators showed that reconstitution of germ-free mice with a microbiome derived from sensitized susceptible mice, but not from sensitized resistant mice, transferred FA susceptibility to the recipient mice [29]. Other studies have shown that Clostridium species effectively exert an allergy-protective action in a FA mouse model, reducing allergic response [30,31]. A suppressive role of the microbiome in FA is also supported by “humanized mouse models”, created with inoculation of microbiota derived from human feces of healthy donors, resulting in reduction of allergic response [31,32]. Feehley et al. showed that germ-free mice colonized with feces from healthy donors were protected against CMA, whereas animals colonized with the feces from CMA infants showed severe anaphylactic responses to cow’s milk proteins with an increase in specific IgE response, and production of Th2 cytokines [31].

The gut microbiome plays an essential role in mediating immune tolerance by promoting several immune and nonimmune mechanisms of action against FA. Current evidence suggests that the gut microbiome protects against FA, inducing the activation of T-regulatory (Treg) cells, which were found to be depleted in germ-free mice, with a consequent predisposition to FA development [33]. Microbiota-induced Treg cells express the nuclear hormone receptor RORγt and differentiate along a pathway that also leads to Th17 cells; in contrast, in the absence of RORγt in Treg cells there is an expansion of GATA-3-expressing Treg cells and conventional Th2 cells, and Th2-associated pathology is exacerbated [34].

The microbiome also promotes B-cell receptor editing within the lamina propria upon colonization [41]. Regulatory B cells have immunosuppressive capacity, which is often mediated by IL-10 secretion, but also IL-35 and TGF-β production [42]. An additional immunoregulatory role is the upregulation of IgG4 antibodies during differentiation to plasma cells [43].

Additional potential mechanisms by which gut microbiome exerts pro-tolerogenic effects in the gut are related to the production of immunoregulatory metabolites, which interact with the host immune cells to promote nonresponsiveness to innocuous luminal antigens [44].

The identification of bacterial metabolites that positively affect the immune tolerance network may be an interesting strategy against FA using a postbiotic approach.

There are several modifiable environmental factors that can influence the occurrence of FA and can potentially be targeted to prevent FA. The window of opportunity, in which environmental factors determine an individual susceptibility to developing communicable and noncommunicable chronic diseases (including allergies) in adult life, is called the “first 1000 days”. This period goes from intrauterine development to the first 2 years of life, during which gut microbiota and immune system development are strongly influenced by environmental factors [63]. Maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation exert a direct and indirect effect on maternal gut and mammalian gland microbiota (enteromammary pathway) and play a pivotal role in early influence on infant gut microbiome composition and function [64]. Other factors such as rural environment, vaginal delivery, increased family size, exposure to pets, breastfeeding, a high-fiber diet, and/or fermented food are associated with a protective effect against FA development. In contrast, cesarean section delivery, prenatal and early-life exposure to antibiotics, gastric acidity inhibitors, antiseptic agents, and junk-food-based and/or low-fiber/high-fat diets may increase the risk of FA development. These environmental factors are mostly related to the structure and function of the gut microbiome [65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78] (Figure 2).

Probiotics are defined as “live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts as part of food, confer a health benefit on the host” [79]. Probiotics could act at different levels in the immune tolerance network: modulating gut microbiome structure and function (e.g., increasing butyrate production) [13]; interacting with enterocytes with subsequent modulation of nonimmune (gut permeability and mucus thickness) [80,81] and immune tolerogenic mechanisms (stimulation of secretory IgA and β-defensin production) [82]; and modulation of cytokine response by immune cells [52,59,83,84,85]. Probiotic supplementation represents an interesting option to prevent and treat FA. The most common probiotic bacteria fall into two groups, namely lactobacilli and bifidobacteria.

LGG has also been studied in patients with peanut allergies. In a clinical trial, LGG was administered with peanut oral immunotherapy for 18 months. Subjects receiving the combination treatment had higher rates of desensitization to peanut compared to placebo (82.1% vs. 3.6%, respectively) [96]. A follow-up study of 48 of the 56 children who participated in this combined probiotic and oral immunotherapy trial showed that treated individuals were more likely to have continued eating peanut compared with those who took a placebo, four years after treatment cessation (67% vs. 4%, p = 0.001); moreover, more participants from the treated group had smaller peanut skin-prick test size and higher peanut sIgG4:sIgE ratios compared with placebo-treated controls [97].

A prebiotic is now defined as “a substrate that is selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit”, including nondigestible compounds, such as oligosaccharides or soluble fermentable fibers that are selectively utilized and promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms and improve health [98]. In particular, the galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS)/fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) combination is the most studied. The mechanisms of action of prebiotics are due to direct and indirect effects. Indirect effects include selective fermentation, increasing populations of resident health-promoting microorganisms of the gut. SCFAs mediate prebiotics’ direct beneficial effects at the intestinal and extraintestinal level [46,99]. The supplementation of prebiotics has been proposed as a possible method of intervention in the prevention of allergic disorders [100]. However, the vast majority of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses conducted in this area have concluded that although several studies show a positive effect of prebiotics on allergic manifestations, the existing evidence is not sufficient to recommend prebiotic as a routine method for allergy prevention in formula-fed infants [101,102]. Thus, further rigorous studies in this field are required.

The term postbiotic refers to the use of nonviable cells or cell fractions which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host. Additionally, the term postbiotic is also related to soluble components such as SCFAs, vitamins, bacteriocins, organic acids, enzymes, hydrogen peroxide, ethanol, diacetyl, peptides, cell-surface proteins, teichoic acids, peptidoglycan-derived muropeptides, endo- and exopolysaccharides, lactocepins, plasmalogens, polyphosphates, and quorum-sensing molecules produced by live probiotic cells in fermentation processes or synthetically produced in a laboratory [103,104]. The immunomodulatory mechanisms elicited by SCFAs represent one of the strongest connections between diet, gut microbiome, and allergic diseases [44]. In a human cohort of 301 1-year old children, significant associations were reported between the composition of dietary intake and stool SCFA content, suggesting that diet can be used to modulate microbial production of SCFAs. The authors also investigated the role of SCFAs in allergy prevention and found that the children with the highest levels of butyrate had a reduced risk of becoming sensitized to food allergens [105]. As we said above, preclinical studies have shown that among SCFAs, butyrate contributes to protection against the development of FA through multiple tolerogenic mechanisms. In human observational studies, butyrate deficiency was observed in allergic children [106], whereas an enrichment of butyrate-producing taxa (Clostridia class and Firmicutes phylum) was observed in children with faster CMA resolution [14]. More recently, Cait et al., using shotgun sequencing, analyzed the fecal microbiomes (at 3 month and 1 year stool samples) of 105 atopic children from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study to investigate whether bacterial butyrate production in the early-infancy gut is protective against the development of atopic diseases later in life. The authors found that bacteria involved in butyrate production were rather depleted in 3-month-old infants who later developed atopy. Analyzing the gut microbiome function, they also found that 3-month-old infants who later had allergic manifestations lacked genes encoding key enzymes for both carbohydrate breakdown and butyrate production [107]. We evaluated the direct effects of butyrate on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from children affected by challenge-proven IgE-mediated CMA. PBMCs were stimulated with BLG in the presence or absence of butyrate. Preliminary results show that butyrate stimulates IL-10 and IFN-γ production and decreases the DNA methylation rate of two cytokine genes.

These data suggest the potential of a postbiotic approach, based on the use of SCFAs against FA. However, clinical trials based on SCFA supplementation for FA prevention and treatment have yet to be undertaken. Therefore, there is no current recommendation from any scientific society on the optimal postbiotic administration frequency for the prevention and treatment of FA.

Synbiotics are a mixture of prebiotics and probiotics that affect the host by improving the survival and implantation of live microbial dietary supplements in the gastrointestinal tract, improving the health of the host [108]. Candy et al. [109] designed a study to investigate whether synbiotic ingredients could improve the gut microbiota in infants with non-IgE-mediated CMA to achieve a microbial composition close to that seen in healthy, breastfed infants. Infants with suspected non-IgE-mediated CMA were administered the test formula containing the synbiotics, or a control formula without the synbiotics. The test formula was a hypoallergenic, nutritionally complete amino-acid-based formula, including a prebiotic blend of fructo-oligosaccharides and the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium breve M-16V. The control formula was an amino-acid-based formula without synbiotics. The authors concluded that the amino-acid-based formula containing specific synbiotics improved the fecal microbiota of infants with suspected non-IgE-mediated CMA, approximating the composition of the gut microbiota of healthy, breastfed infants.

A planned but not yet recruiting randomized, double-blind clinical trial of children at high risk for allergy will compare partially hydrolyzed infant formula with synbiotics vs. standard infant formula (NCT03067714) for the primary outcome of doctor-diagnosed IgE-mediated allergic manifestations.

Fecal microbiota transplantation represents another approach to shape the gut microbiota in FA patients. The idea behind this strategy is that fecal microbiota transplantation from a healthy donor to a disease recipient can restore gut eubiosis by promoting oral tolerance [111,112]. Recently, a human study revealed that fecal microbiota transplantation is able to induce remission of infantile allergic colitis through restoration of gut microbiota diversity [113]. However, the available data in this field remain limited and the relevant scientific work is just beginning. A small Phase I open-label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral encapsulated fecal microbiota for the treatment of peanut allergy is underway (NCT02960074).

Growing evidence suggests that dysbiosis in early life is a crucial factor for FA development. For this reason, the gut microbiome is emerging as an innovative target for pediatric FA prevention and treatment [114,115,116,117,118,119]. Shaping the gut microbiome with an intervention in the form of modifiable environmental factors and/or with pro-/pre-/syn-/postbiotics is a promising strategy against FA. In this field, evidence from human and animal studies is encouraging, but many questions remain unresolved.
