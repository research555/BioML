The gut microbiome as a biomarker of differential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to exact a devastating global toll. Ascertaining the factors underlying differential susceptibility and prognosis following viral exposure is critical to improving public health responses. We propose that gut microbes may contribute to variation in COVID-19 outcomes. We synthesise evidence for gut microbial contributions to immunity and inflammation, and associations with demographic factors affecting disease severity. We suggest mechanisms potentially underlying microbially mediated differential susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These include gut microbiome-mediated priming of host inflammatory responses and regulation of endocrine signalling, with consequences for the cellular features exploited by SARS-CoV-2 virions. We argue that considering gut microbiome-mediated mechanisms may offer a lens for appreciating differential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, potentially contributing to clinical and epidemiological approaches to understanding and managing COVID-19.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, has triggered a pandemic with devastating global consequences. Here, we evaluate how the gut microbiome (see Glossary) may act as a driver of COVID-19 risk and contribute to COVID-19 outcomes. Several risk factors contribute to the risk of COVID-19 disease severity [1,2], and COVID-19 symptoms range from mild and transient to prolonged illness that may involve pronounced inflammation and death. The striking variation in outcomes suggests that sociodemographic or biological factors characteristic of individual hosts or populations may modify the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, dynamic causal modelling [3] has been applied to epidemiological patterns. This approach emphasises differential susceptibility, which suggests that there are populations that are resistant or less susceptible to infection [4., 5., 6., 7.] and, by implication, populations that are more susceptible and at greater risk of virulent infection. The specific causes of differential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 remain under investigation and, because many of these causes are presently unobserved or ‘hidden’, they have been referred to as immunological dark matter [6,8]. The goals of understanding host–virus interactions and effectively treating infections both require knowledge of the factors contributing to outcome heterogeneity. Accounting for as much of this heterogeneity and differential susceptibility as possible may help clarify requisite population immunity levels to attenuate viral transmission [9] and inform development of early interventions for those who exhibit characteristics that are predictive of symptom severity.

We propose that the gut microbiome contributes to differential susceptibility or immunological dark matter underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, the potential of the gut microbiome to confer risk or resilience against diseases has already been investigated in the context of other pathogens. For example, gut microbes have been shown to modulate susceptibility to Salmonella infection (caused by a bacterium) [10] and malaria (caused by a plasmodium) [11]. We suggest here that the gut microbiome may confer upon hosts both risk and resilience to SARS-CoV-2, depending on the baseline microbial profile of the host. Researchers have already proposed important ways in which pandemic-related conditions (e.g., lockdowns and distancing measures) affect microbial communities [12] and here we discuss the converse, focusing on the gut microbiome as a biomarker and a contributing factor to COVID-19 outcomes. We first synthesise recent research connecting the gut microbiome to SARS-CoV-2 and briefly evaluate associations between the gut microbiome and relevant aspects of host physiology in the context of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. We then analyse the gut microbiome as it relates to prominent risk factors for COVID-19 symptom severity. Finally, we explore the implications of the gut microbiome and differential susceptibility for management of the COVID-19 pandemic. At present, the gut microbiome→risk factor→COVID-19 pathway is largely speculative and has not yet been clearly established. Nevertheless, we hope that discussion of these associations and potential underlying mechanisms may guide future research into these connections.

The gut microbiome plays critical roles in training and regulating the immune system of the host [13., 14., 15.]. Gut microbes confer colonisation resistance, reducing the probability of pathogens successfully establishing themselves in the local gut ecosystem [16]. Gut microbes also regulate early antiviral responses. For instance, germ-free mice possess mononuclear phagocytes that show impaired cytokine gene expression, especially with respect to type I interferons, which are critical for effective host antiviral response [17]. Similarly, antibiotic-induced ablation of gut microbial populations reduces the capacity of the host to launch robust antiviral responses, and thus, influenza virus infection triggers more severe symptoms in antibiotic-treated mice compared with untreated controls [18]. These findings suggest that a healthy gut microbiome is necessary for appropriate antiviral defence.

SARS-CoV-2 entry into susceptible cells is promoted by virus–cell fusion, which occurs when the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and is cleaved by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and other host proteases, triggering conformational changes that enable membrane fusion [28,29]. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are abundant in alveolar tissue [28,30], but are also widely distributed across other host tissues, including the gut [31., 32., 33., 34.]. Therefore, any effects of gut microbes on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 might be expected to affect the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

COVID-19 can present with gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation [35,36], which has prompted research into gut microbial contributions to COVID-19 outcomes [37]. In Table 1 , we summarise an emerging body of empirical research on the associations between SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 outcomes, and microbial communities. Although we focus mainly on the gut microbiome in Table 1, we also report data on host-associated microbiomes at other body sites. Collectively, these studies report differences in the microbial composition of patients with COVID-19 compared with those of healthy controls or patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infections [38., 39., 40., 41., 42., 43.]. Available studies suggest that the gut microbial communities of patients with COVID-19 exhibit lower taxonomic diversity [42., 43., 44., 45.] and an increase in opportunistic pathogens [42., 43., 44.], although the extent to which these differences are attributable to concomitant antibiotic treatment in the hospital setting remains unclear. Moreover, the composition of the gut microbiota has been found to covary with disease severity [44,46,47] and dysfunctional immune responses [46]. Compared with healthy controls, researchers have observed higher relative abundances in patients with COVID-19 of gut bacterial taxa including Ruminococcus gnavus, Clostridium ramosum, Coprobacillus, Akkermansia muciniphila, and Eggerthella lenta, and lower relative abundances of Alistipes shahii and several butyrate producers, such as Roseburia intestinalis, Eubacterium hallii, Ruminococcus bromii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii [43,44]. The depletion of butyrate producers may be relevant to disease aetiology because butyrate is the primary metabolic fuel for colonocytes and important for maintaining colonic epithelial integrity [48]. Additionally, some gut bacterial taxa, including Bacteroides spp. found to be inversely correlated with faecal SARS-CoV-2 load in hospitalised patients [43], are capable of modulating the expression and function of cell surface receptors that regulate viral entry into cells, including ACE2 in the gut [43]. Relatedly, Bacteroides has been associated with the modification of lung heparan sulfate, which may in turn alter virion adhesion to host cells [49]. Heparan sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan that regulates structural and functional processes in lung tissue, with implications for lung pathophysiology [50] (Table 1). Such research supports an association between the abundance of particular microbial species and the capacity of the virus to successfully infect the host.

While the studies summarised in Table 1 are mostly correlational, some of the findings do appear to reconcile with the role of gut bacteria in training and regulating the immune system and the particularly well-established link between gut microbes and the shaping of adaptive T and B cell responses, both locally and systemically [57., 58., 59.]. Gnotobiotic studies have shown that both T cells and B cells are regulated by the microbiome. For instance, T cell differentiation and proliferation depend on the presence of gut microbes [15]. Gut microbes have also been shown to play a crucial role in activating mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells [60], which were recently found to be associated with COVID-19 disease severity [61,62]. Similarly, with respect to B cells, experiments in mice indicate that B cell differentiation is promoted indirectly by the gut microbiota through upregulation of interleukin (IL) production, specifically IL-1β and IL-6 [63].

Some of the dominant risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes are inflammation-linked metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, and demographic characteristics, such as older age (Box 1 ) and male biological sex (Box 2 ) [1,2,64]. Each of these characteristics is associated with variations in gut microbial composition and function.

Apart from altering probabilities of hyperinflammation, variation in the baseline gut microbial profile and the resilience of the gut microbiota in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection may also modulate inflammation associated with metabolic diseases now known to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, including diabetes mellitus [1]. For instance, several studies found that antibiotic administration reduced inflammation and insulin resistance in high-fat diet-fed mice or mice genetically susceptible to metabolic disease [83,84]. Moreover, germ-free mice receiving microbial transfers from insulin-resistant mice exhibited more inflammation than counterparts receiving microbial transfers from controls [84]. These results demonstrate a causal role for gut microbes in the generation of an inflammatory phenotype that could then serve as a risk factor in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Associations between the microbiome and risk factors for COVID-19 such as host age and biological sex (see Box 1, Box 2, respectively) can be investigated experimentally using animal models. Although mice are most commonly used in studies of both immune function and the microbiome, the existing SARS-CoV-2 virus now in circulation does not readily infect mice due to inefficient interactions with the mouse orthologue of ACE2 [85]. This limitation could be overcome through the use of ACE2 transgenic mice [86,87], mice transduced with adenoviruses encoding human ACE2 [88,89], or alternatively, by exposing common murine strains such as C57BL/6 or Swiss Webster to the recently developed mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA virus [90]. Such techniques have already delivered interesting results pertaining to interactions between the host microbiome and SARS-CoV-2 infection. For instance, researchers have recently examined the actions of SARS-CoV-2 in vaccinated and unvaccinated ACE2 transgenic mice [44]. Infected unvaccinated mice showed reduced gut bacterial diversity relative to vaccinated mice exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Similar to changes previously observed in humans with COVID-19 relative to healthy controls (see Table 1), infected unvaccinated mice showed elevations in Odoribacter and A. muciniphila, as well as reductions in Lactobacillus reuteri and Bacteroides uniformis, relative to vaccinated animals.

Animal models can similarly be used to examine microbial associations with host differential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. For instance, consider the possibility that an aged microbiome confers increased risk for severe infection. This could be tested via experimental colonisation studies in gnotobiotic mice susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 or treated with the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA virus [90]. Germ-free animals could be colonised with faecal microbial communities from young and old mice, or young and old humans, and then be exposed to the virus. If harbouring an aged microbiome is a risk factor for COVID-19, then we might expect faecal microbiota transplantation to trigger more severe symptoms in recipients of microbiotas from older individuals, relative to recipients with younger donors. In general, this type of research demonstrates that animal models may be able to generate useful and fine-grained information that can inform our understanding of the role of the microbiome in COVID-19.

It has become increasingly apparent that the enormous heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility, virulence, transmission, and vaccination status play key roles in shaping the time course of the pandemic and variations between individuals, groups, communities, and countries [6,7,93., 94., 95.]. Accounting for this heterogeneity suggests that the requisite levels of herd immunity may be lower than assumed under conventional models, which often do not consider heterogeneity and differential susceptibility in detail. Differential susceptibility, although biologically realistic, is often difficult to incorporate into epidemiological models. To explain quantitative dissociations between the incidence of infection, time-varying infection:fatality ratios, and fluctuations in seroprevalence, it is necessary to model populations as mixtures of individuals who are: (i) more or less exposed to the virus, due to vaccination status, geospatial factors, population density, population-level behavioural factors (such as mask-wearing, hand washing, self-isolation, time spent outdoors, and vaccination), and cultural factors (such as the value placed on personal space); (ii) differentially capable of transmitting the virus, due to differences in vaccination status or viral shedding [96., 97., 98.]; and (iii) more or less susceptible to virulent infection, due to vaccination status, potential cross-reactive immunity with other β-coronaviruses, individual differences in the expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 [7,99., 100., 101.], or other host factors that may constitute immunological dark matter.

Of course, these situations are highly simplified. There is no single ‘resilient’ microbiome. There is also no strictly ‘neutral’ microbiome. Furthermore, the sources of differential susceptibility (e.g., vaccination status, prior immunity, comorbidities, age, sex, and microbial composition) do not confer their effects in isolation. Rather, they interact with one another to generate complex profiles of risk and resilience. Moreover, individual resilience and symptom severity are dynamic and continuous, as opposed to categorical, and are known to depend on the extent and duration of exposure to the virus (i.e., contact rates and mean periods of infectiousness). Accordingly, susceptible individuals may avoid infection, and resistant or less-susceptible individuals may still contract the virus, although the latter would be expected to suffer fewer symptoms, recover more quickly, and be less infectious due to faster recovery, lower viral loads, or lower viral shedding rates.

We have highlighted how explicit considerations of the gut microbiome may elucidate aspects of COVID-19 risk and resilience. To our knowledge, the microbiome is not presently systematically considered in COVID-19 research, despite its potential to affect infection response and supplement disease management. In this vein, there remain numerous important issues in need of investigation (see Outstanding questions). There are several areas in which research can readily be conducted. For example, faecal samples can be acquired easily and non-invasively and used to assess interactions between the gut microbiome, COVID-19 risk factors, therapeutic interventions, and disease outcomes. Moreover, as discussed earlier, there are now several animal models being used to study COVID-19 [87., 88., 89., 90., 91., 92.,106], and these too provide ready sources of microbial data if researchers choose to collect faecal samples and profile the associated microbial communities through sequencing or targeted qPCR. Experiments with gnotobiotic animal models may prove especially useful because these offer unique opportunities to isolate causal effects of the gut microbiome on host phenotypes. There are also several areas in which clinicians may benefit and to which they could contribute (see Clinician’s corner).

We note that many inconsistencies and contradictions exist across studies reporting interactions between the gut microbiome and human health [108,109,183,186]. Part of the difficulty arises from day-to-day gut microbial plasticity in response to variable environmental factors such as diet [110,111], and the high degree of interindividual gut microbial dissimilarity across humans, which often necessitates longitudinal sampling or very large data sets to derive reliable patterns [112]. The COVID-19 pandemic provides precisely such an opportunity on a global scale. Accordingly, we recommend routine collection and analysis of faecal samples alongside standard patient data. We also emphasise the need for prospective approaches characterising longitudinal microbiome change as individuals progress from healthy to infected to recovered, as well as before and after vaccination. Overall, investigating the microbiome in the context of COVID-19 could deepen our understanding of the current pandemic, facilitate responses to future outbreaks, and advance our basic appreciation of the microbiome as a fundamental component, and regulator, of host immunity.
