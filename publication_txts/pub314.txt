Gut Microbiome and Organ Fibrosis

Fibrosis is a pathological process associated with most chronic inflammatory diseases. It is defined by an excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins and can affect nearly every tissue and organ system in the body. Fibroproliferative diseases, such as intestinal fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, progressive kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, often lead to severe organ damage and are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, for which there are currently no effective therapies available. In the past decade, a growing body of evidence has highlighted the gut microbiome as a major player in the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune system, with severe implications in the pathogenesis of multiple immune-mediated disorders. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been associated with the development and progression of fibrotic processes in various organs and is predicted to be a potential therapeutic target for fibrosis management. In this review we summarize the state of the art concerning the crosstalk between intestinal microbiota and organ fibrosis, address the relevance of diet in different fibrotic diseases and discuss gut microbiome-targeted therapeutic approaches that are current being explored.

Fibrosis is a complex pathological process that results from excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in response to tissue injury [1]. It is the final pathological outcome of most chronic inflammatory diseases and a major contributor to organ malfunction and failure [2]. Fibrotic tissue responses can affect nearly every tissue and organ system and are responsible for up to 45% of all deaths in developed countries [3]. Despite being recognized as a major health problem worldwide, very few treatments are currently available for the treatment of fibrotic disorders and they have limited efficacy [3].

The aim of this review is to summarize the role of intestinal microbiota in the development and progression of fibrosis in different organs, such as the intestine, the liver, the kidney, the lungs and the heart, and provide an update on the current strategies targeting the gut microbiome in the treatment of fibrotic diseases.

Chronic inflammation appears to be the major event triggering gut fibrogenesis, through mesenchymal cell recruitment and activation [14]. Intestinal fibrosis-associated inflammation may occur much more severely than in liver, kidney, or lung fibrosis [15,16], such as that occurring in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although the intestine shows an impressive ability to fully regenerate after short-lived insults (infections, acute peptic ulcer, etc.), under the presence of continuous severe inflammation, the mesenchymal cells (in the form of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, or smooth muscle cells) are continuously activated, producing excessive ECM, and leading to fistulae or stricture formations with possible intestinal obstruction [15]. To date, there is no pharmacological therapy that is effective in reversing intestinal fibrosis; therefore, a deeper understanding of intestinal fibrosis mechanisms is urgent in the search for innovative strategies.

In brief, there are several arguments implicating the role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of intestinal fibrosis, directly or through inflammation. For that reason, modulation of the gut microbiome (as discussed in chapter 8) may constitute a valuable therapeutic tool in the management of intestinal fibrosis.

Liver fibrosis is an insidious process of a sustained wound-healing response to chronic liver injury, such as chronic viral infections, alcohol-related liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and autoimmune and genetic diseases [37]. Liver fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of ECM proteins, in a dynamic process that involves complex signaling pathways and cross-talk between hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells and immune cells, leading to the destruction of the physiological architecture of the liver [8,37].

In conclusion, although it is now accepted that liver damage and fibrosis can result from interplay between the gut microbiota and the host liver and immune cells, further studies are needed to better understand this interaction for future microbiome target strategies.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing global health problem, affecting at least 10 percent of the world’s population, and this percentage progressively increases with aging [56]. Fibrosis is the final pathological feature of CKD and is well recognized to contribute to the progression of almost all forms of kidney disease, behaving as an independent predictor of deterioration of renal function [57]. In CKD, fibrosis typically results from chronic inflammation of renal parenchyma [58]. Although TGF-β1 has been regarded as the main contributor to the pathological fibrotic process in CKD, metabolic and innate immune responses are now recognized as important contributors to target in this process. In addition, evidence now indicates that the activated pathological fibroblast is the dominant cell in the production of cytokines and chemokines in CKD [59].

Multiple studies comprising prebiotics, probiotics, and symbiotics (discussed further in chapter 8) have been made, aiming to restore a healthy gut microbiota and, through this means, to manage uremia and restrain the progression of kidney diseases (characterized by increasing fibrosis of the tissue, regardless of the etiology of the disease) [117]. Despite some promising results, the highly personal response of one’s gut microbiome to multiple stimuli and the high degree of variability between the conducted studies has so far hindered the attainment of a one-size-fits-all formulation. Personalized medicine, that is, tailored approaches that address individual needs, hold great potential for the management of kidney fibrosis, which remains largely underexplored.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a pathologic process that underlies a highly heterogeneous group of lung diseases with multiple causes, clinical manifestations and pathological features [118]. It is mainly characterized by inflammation and by the excessive deposition of ECM in the lungs, which causes architectural changes in the lung parenchyma, such as thickening and stiffening of the lung walls that may ultimately result in acute respiratory decline and organ failure [119,120]. As most pathological alterations predominate in the lung interstitium, the disorders are usually named interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Lung damage from ILDs is often progressive and irreversible and represents an important source of morbidity and death [121].

Altogether, both direct and indirect evidence implicate the gut microbiome in the regulation of the immune responses and inflammatory state of the things, with consequences relevant to the management of pulmonary fibrosis.

Cardiovascular diseases are a global health and financial burden, taking ~17.9 million lives every year [161]. Cardiac fibrosis is a pathological hallmark of most cardiovascular pathologies and nearly all etiologies of heart diseases involve the formation of fibrosis that persists in the myocardium of heart failure (HF) patients even after conventional treatment [162,163]. At the cellular level, fibrosis results from activation of fibroblasts by pro-inflammatory signals such as TGF-β1 [164]. In response to these stimuli, fibroblasts proliferate and differentiate in myofibroblasts, acquiring new phenotypic features such as increased expression of SMA and secretion of ECM constituents, such as collagen type I and III fibrils, which in time become cross-linked and form mature and compact fibers [165,166]. Despite being relevant to the initial repair process, namely, in the context of myocardial infarction, excessive fibrosis increases tissue stiffness, impairs cardiomyocyte coupling, facilitates arrhythmias and contributes to organ dysfunction and HF. Hence, early detection, prevention and reversion of cardiac fibrosis are key targets to advance HF management.

In Table 1, a summary of the main results concerning gut microbiota alterations associated with fibrosis and fibrogenic pathways in different organs is presented.

Diet has a vast impact on several aspects of our health, and a healthy lifestyle encapsulating an adequate diet and exercise routine is key to a healthy life. Inflammation is a known crucial trigger for fibrosis, and diet and inflammation are tightly linked [204,205]. For example, typical North American and Northern European diets are associated with a higher intake of saturated fats and higher levels of inflammatory markers, whereas a traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern has shown anti-inflammatory effects [205]. The gut microbiome also impacts inflammation, with a balanced bacterial community providing the necessary metabolites to inhibit intestinal inflammation [206]. A dysbiotic microbiome, on the other hand, seems to be associated with the presence of key circulating inflammatory analytes [207]. Diet plays a significant role in shaping the gut microbiome, with studies showing that dietary alterations are capable of inducing large microbial shifts [208].

A sufficient dietary intake, improved nutrient metabolism, supplementation with beneficial molecules (e.g., amino acids) and weight and body mass index management are critical measures to control the progression of liver and lung fibrosis [196,219,220]. Given the link between diet, inflammation and fibrosis, dietary modifications seem to be a promising strategy in fibrosis prevention and management. Likewise, the modulation of the microbiome from a dysbiotic towards a balanced state might promote the production of anti-inflammatory molecules [206], protecting against disease progression and opening up the door for the microbiome as a potential therapeutic target in fibrosis.

Given the increasing evidence regarding the tight relationship between the gut microbiome and disease, the human microbiome has been gaining attention as a therapeutic target to manage or prevent a wide range of conditions [221,222]. Microbiome-targeted therapies have been proposed as a way to potentially manipulate the gut microbiome towards a desired state and therefore ameliorate dysbiosis and the associated symptoms [223,224]. These therapies generally focus on depleting overabundant species or overall microbial load using antibiotics, modulating the microbiome through dietary interventions or supplementation with pre and/or probiotics or even performing whole-microbiota transplants in the form of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) [221,225].

Antibiotics are currently used to manage chronic liver disease, which can progress to liver fibrosis [223,225]. Rifaximin, a minimally absorbable oral antibiotic, is used in the management of cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy, with a significant reduction in hospitalizations and an improvement in maintaining remission [223,226]. In patients with cirrhosis, rifaximin only led to minimal changes in microbial taxonomic composition, but induced significant changes in microbial metabolic function, promoting an increase in serum levels of long-chain fatty acids and carbohydrate metabolism intermediates, and a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels [223,225,227].

Regarding cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial fibrosis, narrow-spectrum antibiotics can be used to modulate the microbiome by targeting bacteria that contribute to the production of TMAO, a cardiovascular risk predictor that is strongly associated with myocardial fibrosis [182,228]. Minocycline, for example, can reduce taxa belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, thereby ameliorating the gut dysbiosis and increasing diversity and ultimately lowering blood pressure [228,229]. However, long-term use of antibiotics may lead to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance [222,230]. With multi-drug resistant bacteria already causing much concern in our society, therapies that modulate the microbiome without drugs should be applied instead, although antibiotics can still be used in the short term before other modulation approaches (for example, before FMT or probiotic supplementation) to deplete pathogenic species and improve overall treatment efficacy [222,223,231].

The intimate connection between nutrition and the microbiome allows for the manipulation of the gut microbiota through food [232]. In fact, empirical therapeutic modulation of the gut microbiome through dietary intervention has been performed for thousands of years, for example, using traditional herbal medicines [233]. Prebiotics can be categorized as a dietary intervention, since they are defined as substrates that when consumed are selectively utilized by host microorganisms, conferring health benefits [131].

However, it should be noted that dietary interventions in a clinical context have some limitations, such as the lack of guidelines due to the need for a personalized nutritional approach, which requires both an extensive dietary analysis and the aid of a nutritionist [232]. Additionally, as with probiotics, the effects of prebiotic therapy in conditions associated with fibrosis can be mild and inconsistent, possibly due to dosage or differences in the host microbiota [221,239].

Probiotics are defined as living microorganisms which could have health benefits for the host if consumed in adequate amounts [243]. In contrast to other techniques, such as FMT, probiotic therapy constitutes a targeted modulation of the gut microbiota by adding the “healthy” probiotic to the community [221].

Symbiotics are a combination of probiotics and prebiotics. The prebiotics are often composed of fermented dietary fibers that aid in the growth and survival of the probiotics [223,243]. Since the prebiotics support the probiotics, this combination might promote therapeutic efficiency. A study of symbiotics in liver disease found that symbiotic treatment in cirrhotic patients increased non-urease-producing Lactobacillus species in the fecal content, and this modulation of the gut microbiota was associated with a reduction in blood ammonia levels and in endotoxemia [252], showcasing the potential of symbiotics in delaying the progression of liver disease.

FMT has been used as a therapeutic tool in a range of infections and gastrointestinal conditions, and has been shown to be highly efficient in the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, with an efficiency rate of over 80% [221,222,223,230,253]. In this procedure, a stool is collected from a healthy donor and transferred to a patient via a colonoscopy, nasogastric tube or enema, among other delivery routes, as a way to improve an undesired microbiome state by re-populating the gut with healthy microbiota [221,223,230,253].

More studies are necessary to ensure the safety and efficiency of FMT, specifically the screening of donors to avoid the spread of pathobionts to the recipient, and the standardization of sample preparation are necessary steps in order to establish FMT as a widely used, successful clinical approach [221,225,228,230,232].

Gut microbiome dysbiosis is emerging as a common factor across fibrotic diseases in different organs. Its established correlation with the systemic inflammatory state of the host and its emerging role in local inflammation and oxidative state are suggestive of a gut microbiome-host axis that may contribute to the regulation of fibrotic pathways underlying different diseases.

The modulation of gut microbial microbiota holds exciting promise for the prevention and management of fibrotic diseases, either through its direct effect in the regulation of specific fibrotic pathways or through a synergistic effect with other therapeutic options.
