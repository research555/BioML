The Potential Utility of Prebiotics to Modulate Alzheimer’s Disease: A Review of the Evidence

The gut microbiome has recently emerged as a critical modulator of brain function, with the so-called gut-brain axis having multiple links with a variety of neurodegenerative and mental health conditions, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Various approaches for modulating the gut microbiome toward compositional and functional states that are consistent with improved cognitive health outcomes have been documented, including probiotics and prebiotics. While probiotics are live microorganisms that directly confer beneficial health effects, prebiotics are oligosaccharide and polysaccharide structures that can beneficially modulate the gut microbiome by enhancing the growth, survival, and/or function of gut microbes that in turn have beneficial effects on the human host. In this review, we discuss evidence showing the potential link between gut microbiome composition and AD onset or development, provide an overview of prebiotic types and their roles in altering gut microbial composition, discuss the effectiveness of prebiotics in regulating gut microbiome composition and microbially derived metabolites, and discuss the current evidence linking prebiotics with health outcomes related to AD in both animal models and human trials. Though there is a paucity of human clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of prebiotics in altering gut microbiome-mediated health outcomes in AD, current evidence highlights the potential of various prebiotic approaches for beneficially altering the gut microbiota or gut physiology by promoting the production of butyrate, indoles, and secondary bile acid profiles that further regulate gut immunity and mucosal homeostasis, which are associated with beneficial effects on the central immune system and brain functionality.

Microbiota dysbiosis, characterized as the disproportional increase or decrease in abundance of certain bacterial strains, has been associated with multiple complications, including obesity [1], type 2 diabetes (T2DM) [2], and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) [3]. AD is the most common neurodegenerative disease affecting about 5 million people in the U.S., and about 25 million people worldwide [4]. Only about 5–10% of AD patients present with early onset dementia directly linked to genetic mutations that are causal for AD development [5]. The vast majority of AD patients, on the other hand, develop neurodegenerative disease due to a combination of factors including but not limited to apolipoprotein E genotype [6,7], presence of metabolic syndrome and certain lifestyle factors [8], and, as recently revealed, microbiome composition [3]. AD is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and a progressive loss of cognitive function involving the extracellular accumulation of pathogenic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides that oligomerize and aggregate, forming plaques [9], and the intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins that form neurofibrillary tangles [10]. The causes for the formation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are not clear. However, chronic neuroinflammation and dysfunctional microglia have emerged as key drivers of these processes [11,12]. Notably, neuroinflammation has recently been found to be modulated by the gut microbiome via the gut-brain axis [13]. The links between microbiome composition and AD are intriguing and provide potential ways to ameliorate or even prevent AD progression through modifying the microbiome. This could be achieved via various ways, including fecal transplant and consumption of probiotics or prebiotics. Prebiotics are oligosaccharide molecules that are non-digestible to the human host, and which serve as substrates for microorganisms in the gut, and thus modulate the composition and/or function of gut microbes in a manner that is beneficial to the host [14,15]. In this review, we discuss the evidence linking gut microbiome composition and function with AD and its associated co-morbidities, provide an overview of prebiotic types and their effects, discuss evidence for the effectiveness of prebiotics in modulating gut microbiome composition and microbial metabolite production, and discuss the potential for prebiotics to induce a beneficial shift in the gut microbiome and modify health outcomes relevant for individuals with AD.

The importance of diet in modifying the gut microbiome has been emphasized through many intervention studies in humans and animal models. Studies have demonstrated that diet affects gut microbiota composition and diversity [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25]. Diet composition and duration of intervention are the two most relevant diet-related factors in shaping the gut microbiome. The most well-studied dietary interventions thus far have involved the comparison of high-fat or Western diets enriched in animal-derived foods vs. lower-fat or plant-based diets (Figure 1). From animal studies to human studies the diversity and proportion of microbes have been found to be consistently altered by diets depleted vs. enriched in plant substrate. Specifically, diets depleted in non-digestible fiber and enriched in protein and fat have been consistently linked with an increase in protein- and fat-degrading bacteria belonging to the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Deferribacteres, and a decrease in Bacteroidetes and butyrate-producing species, which are generally known to be beneficial for human health [26,27,28,29,30]. Conversely, fiber-enriched diets are typically associated with increases in the abundance of species in the phylum Bacteroidetes, the genus Prevotella, and Bifidobacterium spp. [31,32,33,34,35]. These changes in gut microbiota composition are closely associated with host health and disease. The health effect is not only attributed to the enrichment of beneficial gut microbes but to the production of secondary metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) from the degradation of non-digestible carbohydrates by specific fiber-fermenting taxa [36,37,38]. The presence of these taxa is associated with protection from AD, and a number of associated co-morbidities including T2DM and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In the next several paragraphs we review the evidence linking gut microbiome alterations to AD, as well as associated co-morbidities.

Taken together, the overall findings from the published literature suggest that modifying gut microbial composition and diversity toward a profile associated with healthy individuals consuming healthy diets may help attenuate AD progression. Diets and prebiotic approaches that aim to increase beneficial bacterial species that have been found to be depleted in AD patients such as Bifidobacterium spp., and approaches that aim to decrease the abundance of deleterious bacterial species such as Bilophila may be beneficial for the prevention of AD (Figure 1).

Dietary fibers, which are somewhat difficult to define, can be classified according to their solubility. Insoluble fiber, which does not dissolve in water, passes through the digestive tract providing bulking by absorbing water. Soluble fiber, on the other hand, dissolves in water and is mostly fermented by commensal bacteria residing in the colon and contributing to satiety [75,76]. Although this general categorization of fibers according to their solubility may be useful, insoluble fibers are fermented to a certain degree and some soluble fibers may be non-viscous. Recently, the classification of fiber according to functionality is gaining attention. The functionality depends on the structure and fermentability of the specific dietary fiber. Thus, types of dietary fiber and subsequent gut microbial composition, diversity, and richness changes are highly intriguing areas for further research. It is especially relevant to patients with AD given that particular dietary fibers may modify the gut microbiome in a beneficial direction, increasing the levels of metabolites that improve cognitive function and attenuate neurotoxicity [77]. Here, we have listed a number of dietary fibers with known impacts on enrichment of certain gut microbes, suggesting their potential as prebiotic supplements for AD patients (Table 1).

The structural complexity of dietary fibers and the associated diversity of gut microbes that consume them require further research. It is important to determine the utilization of specific fibers by distinct microbiota and to demonstrate which structural traits and/or components of these fibers affect cognitive function via altering the gut microbiome in future studies.

The overall impact of the gut microbiome on the production of microbial metabolites and gut barrier function is summarized in Figure 2.

There are likely hundreds if not thousands of microbially produced molecules that likely play important roles in host health. Among these, butyrate, indole, and bile acids, are to date, the most well-studied, and their roles in gut health, brain function, and specific roles in the pathophysiology of AD, are starting to emerge. As we gain knowledge on both short-term and long-term effects of diet on the brain mediated by the gut microbiome, it will be important to establish a dossier of evidence of benefit of specific prebiotics for the pathophysiology of AD. In the following section, we discuss potential prebiotic approaches to supplement AD patients.

The effectiveness of prebiotics for the treatment of AD will ultimately need to be evaluated on the basis of their ability to either improve or prevent cognitive decline. However, other symptoms of AD related to behavioral and emotional changes are also viable targets of prebiotic intervention studies in AD patients. The current literature showing the potential effects of prebiotics on cognitive function in both animal models and human studies mainly focuses on the effects of fructans, both in the form of oligosaccharides and inulin, β-glucan from yeast or the bran of cereals, plant polysaccharides, and polysaccharides synthesized from sugars. This evidence is summarized below.

Animal models have been used in several studies to evaluate the effect of prebiotics on AD, particularly mice due to their reliability on intervention and ease of sampling. In this section, animal studies on administration of prebiotics that led to improvement in AD associated brain disorders are summarized. Bimuno-GOS intake in pregnant mice affected the offspring’s exploratory behavior and brain gene expression as well as reducing anxiety [168]. Additionally, fecal butyrate and propionate levels were increased after Bimuno-GOS supplementation in postnatal mice [168]. In another study, behavioral testing was performed on mice from the least stressful (three-chamber test) to the most stressful (forced swim test) for 5 weeks during a 10-week prebiotic administration period including lead-in and lead-out periods [169]. The prebiotic treatment with a FOS+GOS combination resulted in a reduction of stress-related (depression and anxiety) behaviors, and reversed chronic stress (elevations in corticosterone and proinflammatory cytokine levels) in the supplemented mice compared to the control mice with no prebiotic treatment [169]. In a rat model exhibiting oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cognitive decline in the brain induced by high fat diet-induced obesity these outcomes were improved and cognitive function was restored by 12-week supplementation of either prebiotic (xylo-oligosaccharide), probiotic (Lactobacillus paracasei HII01), or combined treatment with similar efficacy [170]. The effectiveness of mannan-oligosaccharide was tested in a 5xFamilial AD transgenic mouse model [171]. The treatment with mannan-oligosaccharide reduced Aβ accumulation in the brain and suppressed neuroinflammatory responses [171]. Mannan-oligosaccharide not only improved cognitive and behavioral disorders, but also gut barrier integrity by reshaping the composition of gut microbiota, specifically increases in the relative abundances of Lactobacillus and decreases in Helicobacter [171]. Importantly, the observed changes in gut microbiota composition and butyrate production were negatively correlated with oxidative stress in the brain and behavioral deficits [171].

Studies on the effects of prebiotic supplementation directly on cognitive and behavioral outcomes in Alzheimer’s patients are currently lacking. However, a few human intervention studies were conducted to test the effectiveness of certain prebiotics alone or with probiotics on improving symptoms associated with AD such as behavioral, mood, memory, anxiety, and cognitive disorders.

Other studies provide supporting evidence that prebiotics modulate brain function in a manner that would be consistent with desired improvements in symptoms of AD but were not necessarily linked with or did not examine gut microbiome composition. Beta-glucans from yeasts, plants or cereals have been shown to have beneficial health effects on the profile of mood state in healthy individuals [181,182]. Plant polysaccharides, which mainly consist of non-starch polysaccharides found in foods were shown to have effect on healthy adults, improving their recognition and memory performance [183,184]. Polydextrose, which is a synthesized prebiotic, was supplemented in healthy females and showed moderate improvement in cognition as well as significant change in abundance of Ruminiclostridium 5 compared to the placebo group [185]. Other studies have found 30–60 mL of lactulose for 3 months improved cognitive function and health-related quality of life in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy [186].

Although human clinical studies examining the effects of specific prebiotics on gut microbiome-mediated cognitive health outcomes in AD patients are lacking, there is mounting evidence that prebiotics have the potential to be a viable approach for ameliorating symptoms associated with AD. Promoting the growth and activity of beneficial, SCFA-producing microbes such as bifidobacteria is emerging as a clear therapeutic target for improving gut barrier function, decreasing inflammation, and improving cognitive and behavioral outcomes. A variety of prebiotic types, particularly fructans, have been found to be effective in modulating gut microbiome composition and microbial metabolite production, and modifying health outcomes relevant for individuals with AD. More research is needed to determine which prebiotics, at what dosages, and in which context (e.g., on what dietary background, in combination with specific probiotics, at what frequency, etc.) are the most effective for not only decreasing AD-associated symptoms such as anxiety and depression, but also potentially improving cognition or preventing the loss of cognitive function in individuals at risk for AD. Further mechanistic research to determine how changes in the gut microbiome related to prebiotic supplementation alter neuroinflammatory signaling are also needed so that targeted, effective, potentially personalized therapies can be developed to treat and prevent the progression of neurodegenerative processes in AD.
