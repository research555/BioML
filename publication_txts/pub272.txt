Resistant starch diet induces change in the swine microbiome and a predominance of beneficial bacterial populations

Dietary fibers contribute to health and physiology primarily via the fermentative actions of the host’s gut microbiome. Physicochemical properties such as solubility, fermentability, viscosity, and gel-forming ability differ among fiber types and are known to affect metabolism. However, few studies have focused on how they influence the gut microbiome and how these interactions influence host health. The aim of this study is to investigate how the gut microbiome of growing pigs responds to diets containing gel-forming alginate and fermentable resistant starch and to predict important interactions and functional changes within the microbiota.

Nine growing pigs (3-month-old), divided into three groups, were fed with either a control, alginate-, or resistant starch-containing diet (CON, ALG, or RS), and fecal samples were collected over a 12-week period. SSU (small subunit) rDNA amplicon sequencing data was annotated to assess the gut microbiome, whereas comprehensive microarray polymer profiling (CoMPP) of digested material was employed to evaluate feed degradation. Gut microbiome structure variation was greatest in pigs fed with resistant starch, where notable changes included the decrease in alpha diversity and increase in relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae- and Ruminococcus-affiliated phylotypes. Imputed function was predicted to vary significantly in pigs fed with resistant starch and to a much lesser extent with alginate; however, the key pathways involving degradation of starch and other plant polysaccharides were predicted to be unaffected. The change in relative abundance levels of basal dietary components (plant cell wall polysaccharides and proteins) over time was also consistent irrespective of diet; however, correlations between the dietary components and phylotypes varied considerably in the different diets.

Resistant starch-containing diet exhibited the strongest structural variation compared to the alginate-containing diet. This variation gave rise to a microbiome that contains phylotypes affiliated with metabolically reputable taxonomic lineages. Despite the significant microbiome structural shifts that occurred from resistant starch-containing diet, functional redundancy is seemingly apparent with respect to the microbiome’s capacity to degrade starch and other dietary polysaccharides, one of the key stages in digestion.

The gut microbiome of animals comprises a broad diversity of bacterial and archaeal phylotypes and is considered a separate organ due to the influence of its metabolic traits on host physiology [1]. Its key roles include modulating food intake, growth and development of the body, energy uptake from food, immune system and proliferation of epithelial cells, and resistance to infections [2]. Diet is one of the most important factors influencing gut microbiome structure and function, which indirectly modulates metabolic activities of the host [3].

In this study, it was hypothesized that the diets containing these two contrasting dietary fibers exert different influences on the pig gut microbiome and affect important interactions and functionalities within the microbiota. Feeding trials were conducted on young animals (growing pigs) where the total energy intake should be less variable than in adult animals, as all individuals require high-energy intake for growth. Therefore, any change in microbiome structure and function in response to dietary fibers may be more visible. Microbiome analysis was conducted over a 12-week period encompassing: SSU rDNA amplicon sequencing, functional analysis of predicted metagenomes, and CoMPP analysis of plant cell wall components (PCWCs). Correlation and co-occurrence analysis were additionally conducted between the relative abundances of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and post-digestion PCWCs.

In order to characterize the effects of ALG and RS on the pigs’ gut microbiomes, we assessed the community structure via 16S rRNA gene analysis. Using amplicon pyrosequencing, we obtained 251,522 SSU rRNA gene fragments in total (approximately 524 nt). Quality filtering and clustering analysis resulted in 2,621 total OTUs from 61 samples. Functional capabilities of each microbiome were predicted using KEGG pathway analyses of simulated metagenomes and compared between diet types to identify differences. CoMPP analysis was used to measure relative PCWC levels in the original feed as well as fecal samples in order to monitor changes of the individual polysaccharides and proteins that were available to the microbiome populations for ingestion (Figure 1). As expected, starch levels (detected using the CBM20 probe) were consistent in the original feed samples for all diets (Additional file 1: Table S1). No starch was detected in the fecal samples of any of the pigs, irrespective of the solubility of the starch component in their diet. Overall, a variety of pectic substrates, hemicellulosic substrates (including xyloglucans, xylans, mannans, and betaglucans), and cellulose were detected in all diet groups. The change in relative abundance of these PCWCs (decrease or increase depending on the PCWC) over time was consistent across all samples, and no differences were observed between diets (Figure 1). Alginate levels were unable to be reported via CoMPP analysis due to the lack of a suitable probe; however, previous pig feeding trials using alginate have indicated that this polysaccharide is detectable in fecal material and is not digested completely [18].

Alpha diversity analyses were performed upon all samples to determine how the different diets affected the microbiome of each animal over the 12-week period. Shannon index plot (Figure 2) and rarefaction curves (Additional file 2: Figure S1) were generated for each diet group to compare the species diversity within each microbial community. Each method demonstrated that the diversity of bacterial OTUs at species level significantly (P < 0.01) decreased in the microbiomes of RS pigs compared to CON pigs, while there was no obvious difference in diversity between ALG and CON pigs. Moreover, time did not significantly affect bacterial alpha diversity in any of the diet groups (ANCOVA, P = 0.053) (Additional file 3: Figure S2).

To explicitly compare the microbiomes of the individual animals used in this study, distance matrices were calculated by unweighted UniFrac [19], visualized via principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) (Figure 3A), and statistical analyses were performed on distance matrices for significance testing (Figure 3B). Pigs fed with the same diet tended to cluster together (Figure 3A), while time did not significantly affect the bacterial community composition of fecal samples within each diet over the 12-week period (Additional file 4: Table S2). CON pigs were shown to cluster in close proximity after samples T2 to T3, indicating that they were acclimatized to their diet within 1 to 3 days after the start of the prebiotic diet. The relatively sporadic clustering between the three pigs fed with the same diet and sampled at the same time was possibly due to the inter-individual variation (Additional file 5: Figures S3 and Additional file 4: Table S2), a commonly observed phenomenon [20,21]. As expected, the first time-point (T1, day −7) samples of all diets had similar microbiome structure since all pigs were fed with the same commercial basal diet at this time. However, from time-point 2 (T2, day 1) when pigs were fed with different diets, their microbiomes started to diverge from each other, with those from RS pigs in one direction while those from ALG and CON pigs jointly in another direction. The structural shift of the microbiome of RS pigs compared to CON and ALG pigs were statistically significant, whereas ALG pigs had similar microbiome composition to CON pigs (Figure 3B).

Overall, the microbiomes of the individual pigs were dominated by the phyla Firmicutes (88.2% in CON pigs, 90.1% in ALG pigs, and 88.3% in RS pigs) and Bacteroidetes (9.7% in CON pigs, 8.6% in ALG pigs, and 10.2% in RS pigs). The other phyla present in low abundance (less than 2.1%) were Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Spirochaetes, TM7 (candidate division), Tenericutes, and a number of unclassified bacteria. Although most of these phyla were present in samples across all diets, Spirochaetes were not detected in RS pigs and TM7 was observed only in ALG pigs.

The relative abundances of some of the bacterial families within dietary groups tended to show variations over time (Figure 5). Streptococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae showed an opposing trend in relative abundance variation over time in all diets. Moreover, relative abundance of some families including Lachnospiraceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, and Veillonellaceae varied over time (becoming more abundant and less abundant over time) in an opposing manner to some other families such as Ruminococcaceae, S24-7, Clostridiaceae, unclassified Clostridiales, and unclassified Bacteroidales, particularly in RS pigs (Figure 5). The patterns of these contrasting changes between particular families were supported by Pearson’s correlations, which were consistent with the different diet types (Additional file 7: Figure S5). For example, specific families that positively correlated with one another and to the RS diet were often negatively correlated to other groups that were positively correlating to the CON diet. ALG correlated positively with Streptococcaceae only, while RS correlated positively with many families such as Veillonellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, and Prevotellaceae that became predominant by RS.

Given the structural changes within the microbiome of RS and ALG pigs compared to CON pigs, we subsequently examined whether the contrasting diets would also cause functional changes within each microbiome. In the absence of shotgun metagenomic sequencing data, we applied PICRUSt [22] to our 16S rRNA gene survey to predict metagenome functional content. PICRUSt is a computational approach in which evolutionary modeling is used to predict the present gene families from 16S data and a reference genome database [22]. The imputed relative abundances of KEGG pathways in each respective sample were used to predict changes in metabolic function within the microbiomes of ALG and RS pigs compared to CON pigs (Figure 6). The RS diet was predicted to significantly affect (P < 0.05) a greater number of KEGG pathways (sevenfold) in the gut microbiome, whereas the ALG diet seemingly had a reduced impact on microbiome function compared to CON diet. The KEGG pathways that exhibited the greatest statistical difference in RS and CON pigs were butanoate, pyruvate, and propanoate metabolism, with all having a higher predicted relative abundance in CON pigs. Interestingly, there were no significant differences in the starch and sucrose metabolism KEGG pathway between RS pigs and ALG pigs compared to CON pigs although a significant difference was observed at one time-point (T3) (P = 0.046) between RS and CON pigs (Additional file 8: Figure S6). While this KEGG pathway map encompasses starch conversion, it also includes cellulose, xylan, betaglucan, and pectin conversion (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kegg2.html, map00500), which are all key PCWCs that were detected using CoMPP analysis.

To investigate correlation/co-occurrence of PCWCs and bacterial taxa, extended local similarity-based networks were applied as they can be used to evaluate correlations between two data types over time. Many different OTUs that were affiliated to various families co-occurred or correlated significantly (P < 0.001) with PCWCs in different diet pigs. Although the relative levels of PCWCs did not show any difference between diets (Figure 1), the number of the OTUs varied in the CON, ALG, and RS networks (Figure 7 and Additional file 9: Figure S7). OTUs affiliated to the Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Lactobacillaceae families were the most abundant taxa that co-occurred/correlated with the PCWCs in all diets.

In the CON network, rhamnogalacturonan I (INTRA-RU1) and xyloglucan (LM15) exhibited the highest number of correlations with different OTUs. These polysaccharides typically had negative correlations (with a one time-point delay such that the shift on OTU relative abundance affects polysaccharide relative abundance with a delay of one time period), suggesting that an increase in the relative abundance of these OTUs was correlated to a decrease in the relative levels of these polysaccharides in CON pigs. Within the RS network, many taxa co-occurred with xyloglucan (LM15), although the OTUs were affiliated to different lineages and the majority of correlations were positive with one time-point delay. Most of the highly abundant S24-7 OTUs (OTU5, OTU2006, and OTU2009) negatively co-occurred in the RS network with more than one PCWC, including arabinan (LM6), arabinogalactan protein (AGP: JIM13), homogalacturonan (HG: LM19), β-(1,3) glucan (BS-400-2), and xylan/arabinoxylan (LM11). However, this varied in the CON network as the same OTUs were only negatively correlated with rhamnogalacturonan 1 (INTRA-RU1). The number of OTUs that exhibited correlations in the ALG network was relatively lower (almost half of CON and RS networks), with the most prominent being negative correlations (with a one time-point delay) between the unclassified Clostridiales and xylan (LM23) and xyloglucan (LM15) as well as Streptococcaceae and xylan (LM23) and glycoproteins (extension: JIM20).

SSU rRNA gene amplicon sequence analysis and CoMPP of PCWCs were used to evaluate the effects of dietary fibers (alginate and type 3 resistant starch) on the gut microbiome of growing pigs during a 12-week feeding experiment. The fibers assessed in this study have contrasting properties, the most prominent being the gel-forming capacity of alginate fibers whereas resistant starch is resistant to the host’s digestive enzymes but fermentable by gut flora in the lower intestine. Findings by Souza da Silva et al. [12,23] demonstrated that these two fibers affected feeding patterns and physiology of growing pigs in different ways. The feeding patterns were affected less by alginate addition in the diet compared to resistant starch addition in a manner that only cumulative and average daily feed intake increased in ALG pigs compared to CON pigs, to achieve similar digestible energy intake. Moreover, both diets increased the relative empty weight of the colon, but only RS increased the weight of the total gastrointestinal tract. This is conceivably the result of an increase in bacterial mass and fermentation end-products [24] or an increase in metabolically active tissue in the colon [12,25]. The gut microbiota plays an important role in host physiology [26], and a different impact on community composition resulting from ingestion of these dietary fibers is therefore expected to occur due to their different physicochemical and metabolic properties. This study showed that resistant starch (type 3) had significant effect on gut community structure of growing pigs while the community composition in ALG pigs was similar to that in CON pigs. Moreover, the demonstrated shift in microbiome structure of RS pigs was specific to diet type in spite of the inter-individual variations.

RS and ALG diets were found to influence OTU and PCWC correlations/co-occurrences over time, with the same PCWCs in CON, ALG, and RS pigs often correlated with different OTUs. This was expected given that alginate and resistant starch caused varying changes to microbiome structure, whereas the PCWC availability in the microbiome is believed to be largely unchanged. This was clearly illustrated for the hemicellulose polysaccharide xyloglucan (target of probe LM15), for which the total number and OTU affiliation of correlations varied substantially between CON, ALG, and RS pigs (Figure 7). Many OTUs affiliated to the Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families were positively correlated to PCWCs and thus inferred in PCWC metabolism in growing pigs regardless of diet type. Both of these families are well known for degradation of complex plant material (for example, cellulose, hemicellulose) in the mammalian gut environment [51].

In conclusion, RS exhibited the strongest structural variation compared to ALG, which is likely resultant from the contrasting physicochemical properties of these dietary fibers. The increase in relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae-, Prevotella- and Ruminococcus-affiliated phylotypes in RS pigs can be considered as desirable traits given the reputation of these groups in fiber degradation and production of short chain fatty acids. Moreover, resistant starch and to a lesser extent alginate, influenced the imputed functionality of predicted metagenomes and correlation between bacterial phylotypes and PCWCs. With all data collectively considered, we speculate that despite the microbiome structural differences between diets, functional redundancy exists in the key metabolic stage of polysaccharide degradation. The observed stability in the imputed KEGG starch and sucrose metabolism pathway and consistent PCWC availability between diets supports this hypothesis. Furthermore, the variation in OTU-PCWC correlations between the different diets suggests that different phylotypes possibly drive PCWC utilization within each feeding regime. These hypotheses require further detailed metagenomic investigations to deduce the metabolic capabilities of key uncultured populations within the microbiome of pigs, and form the basis of our ongoing efforts.

Nine pigs (approximately 3 months old) selected for this study were housed, fed, and sampled at the Nutreco Swine Research Centre facilities, Sint Anthonis, The Netherlands [12]. Each group of three pigs was fed with one of three diets: control (CON) containing no prebiotic dietary fiber, alginate-containing (ALG) and retrograded (Type 3) resistant starch-containing (RS). The control diet was formulated to contain 40% digestible starch, and other diets were formulated from control diet by exchanging alginate (sodium alginate in dry form) or resistant starch (retrograded tapioca starch) for digestible starch on a dry matter. (Additional file 1: Table S1, for further diet details refer to [12]). Weight measurements were also performed during the feeding period. There was no significant difference between the weights of the pigs fed with different diets, although all pigs achieved a final weight (99.4 ± 6.7 kg) greater than three times of the initial weight in the experiment (31.7 ± 1.4 kg). The pigs were labeled with respect to diet they were fed with, such as CON.1, CON.2, CON.3, ALG.1, ALG.2, ALG.3, RS.1, RS.2, and RS.3. All pigs originated from the same batch consisting of castrated males with the exception of one female (ALG.2) and were unrelated except for two siblings (ALG.1 and RS.3). Each pig was fed with the aforementioned diet over a 12-week period (T2 to T7), and fecal samples were collected at seven different time-points (T1: day −7; T2: day 1; T3: day 3; T4: day 7; T5: week 3; T6: week 7; T7: week 12). All pigs were fed with a commercial basal diet for 3 weeks before the experiment commenced and the first fecal sample collection (T1). The adaptation to the diets was performed by gradual exchanging of the commercial diet for one of the CON, ALG, and RS during a 7-day period before T2, from which point the complete differentiation in diets started. The 7-day transition period entailed the following stages: 2 days of the animals being fed with the commercial diet (100%); the third day, the commercial diet was supplemented with 20% of the different prebiotic diets; and from days 4 to 7, the percentage of the prebiotic diet was increased in 20% increments until the prebiotic diet reached 100% (T2). A total of 61 fecal samples were used because the rectum of two pigs were empty at the time of collection of fresh fecal samples (pig ALG.1 at T4 and pig RS.3 at T6), and these two samples were subsequently not available. Fresh fecal samples were homogenized and kept at −20°C until analysis.

Bacterial cells were harvested from 0.3 g of frozen feces using a cell dissociation protocol as described previously [52]. The samples were suspended in acidic dissociation buffer [53] containing (v/v) 0.1% Tween 80, 1% methanol, and 1% tert-butanol, and cells were harvested from supernatant by quick centrifugation. These steps were repeated five times to increase cell yield. Cell pellets were collected by high-speed centrifugation (14,500 g for 5 min) and washed with a wash buffer containing 10 mM TrisHCl and 1 M NaCl. DNA extraction was performed as described in [54] with small modifications. The cells were re-suspended in RBB + C lysis buffer containing 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM TrisHCl, and 50 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and incubated with lysozyme and mutanolysin enzymes at 37°C for 30 min. Further lysis was carried out by addition of 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and incubation at 70°C for 20 min, mixing the tube by inversion every 5 min. Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer was used for DNA precipitation. After repeated treatments with chloroform and phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, DNA was precipitated by isopropanol, washed once with ethanol, re-suspended in water, and kept at −20°C until further analysis.

The SSU rRNA gene fragment hyper variable regions V1 to V3 were amplified from extracted DNA using 8F-515R bacteria-specific primers. The forward primer is a combination of the 454 fusion adapter B sequence and universal bacterial primer 8F, 5′-CCT ATC CCC TGT GTG CCT TGG CAG TCT CAG CAA CAG CTA GAG TTT GAT CCT GG-3′. The reverse primer is a combination of the 454 fusion adapter A sequence including a unique 8 nt multiplex barcode, represented by Ns, and universal bacterial primer 515 R, 5′-CCA TCT CAT CCC TGC GTG TCT CCG ACT CAG NNN NNN NNT TAC CGC GGC TGC T-3′. Each PCR reaction consisted of 25 μl iProof High-Fidelity Master Mix (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA), 0.2 mM forward primer, 0.2 mM reverse primer, 400 ng template DNA, and sterile water to a total volume of 50 uL. The following PCR program was used: denaturation at 98°C for 30 s, 30 cycles of 10 s at 98°C, 30 s at 58°C, and 40 s at 72°C and a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. PCR product concentrations were measured by Qubit® fluorometer using Qubit® dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) and checked by gel electrophoresis (1% agarose gel). All PCR products were pooled into one tube in equal amounts and run on a 1% agarose gel. The band containing pooled PCR products was excised and purified using NucleoSpin Extract II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Pyrosequencing was performed on the 454 GS FLX sequencer (Roche) at the Norwegian Sequencing Center (Oslo, Norway).

The sequencing reads were processed and analyzed using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) version 1.7.0 [55]. Reads of quality lower than 25, lacking a barcode, and/or shorter than 400 or longer than 600 nt were not analyzed further. The remaining reads (93%) were multiplexed to samples based on their nucleotide barcodes. Further error correction was performed using USEARCH version 5.2.236 [56] and UCHIME [57], and the remaining sequences were clustered into OTUs using a 97% sequence identity threshold. A representative sequence set was formed by picking the most abundant sequence from each OTU and aligned against the Greengenes core set database [58] (May 2013 version) by PyNAST [59] with a minimum sequence length of 150 and a minimum identity of 75%. The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier program [60] was used to assign taxonomy to the aligned sequences with a confidence of 0.8. The alignment was filtered prior to generating a phylogenetic tree using a lanemask to remove highly variable regions and positions that were all gaps. A phylogenetic tree was built using filtered, aligned sequences in FastTree [61] which was subsequently used to generate an unweighted UniFrac distance metric [62]. This metric included the calculated distances between samples based on OTU composition of each sample and visualized by principle coordinate analysis (PCoA).

Metagenome functional contents of CON, ALG, and RS diet samples were predicted using PICRUSt [22] online Galaxy version. Closed reference OTU table was generated from filtered reads (previously described) in QIIME v1.7.0 [55] using the Greengenes core set database [58] (May 2013 version) and enabling reverse strand matching. A closed reference OTU table was normalized by 16S rDNA copy number, metagenome was predicted, and they were categorized by function based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways in PICRUSt online Galaxy version. The obtained biom file was processed by STAMP v2.0.8 [63] for statistical analysis; Welch’s t-test was applied to compare the KEGG pathways of diet groups pairwise (RS and CON, ALG and CON) with P value <0.05, confidence intervals of 95% and extended error bars were plotted. Boxplots were plotted to further focus on starch and sucrose metabolism pathway.

CoMPP was used to detect PCWCs in feed and fecal samples as described previously [64]. Two of the samples (CON.2, T6 and CON3, T5) did not contain enough material after the other analyses to be analyzed for PCWC content and were not assessed. Freeze-dried fecal samples (each of 10 mg) were homogenized by mortar and pestle. Alcohol-insoluble residues were obtained by sequential extraction using three solvents: 70% ethanol, methanol/chloroform (1:1), and acetone. Each extraction was followed by vortexing for 30 s and centrifugation at 14,500 g for 10 min to remove supernatant. Following this, the acetone was removed using a pipette and the samples were air dried. PCWCs were extracted from the alcohol-insoluble residues using 50 mM diamino-cyclo-hexane-tetra-acetic acid (CDTA), pH 7.5, and 4 M NaOH with 1% v/v NaBH4, which are known to solubilize pectins and noncellulosic polysaccharides, respectively. For each extraction, 300 μl of solvent was added to each tube and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 2 h. After centrifugation at 2,500 g for 10 min, supernatants were retained, diluted (neat, 5-, 25-, and 125-fold) in Arrayjet buffer (50% water, 50% glycerol, and 0.05% Triton X100) and the three dilutions printed in quadruplets onto nitrocellulose membranes. Every replicate was therefore represented by a 16-spot sub-array (four concentrations and four printing replicates). Arrays were probed with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) (Table 1) and scanned (CanoScan 8800 F, Canon, Søborg, Denmark) and quantified using Array-Pro Analyzer 6.3 (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). The maximal mean spot signal was set to 100%, and all other values within that data set adjusted accordingly. A mean spot signal minimum was set as 5%.

The statistical significant test was applied on unweighted UniFrac distance matrices in QIIME v.1.7.0. The parametric P values were calculated performing two-sample t-tests for the pairs of the groups while nonparametric P values were calculated using Monte Carlo permutation (n = 1,000). The bacterial diversity was calculated at an OTU level using Shannon index that based on the average of ten iterations at equal subsampling size of 1,781. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was run using R (version 3.1.0) package lme4 to identify the effects of time and diets on diversity of bacterial communities (based on Shannon indexes) and the relative abundances of taxa in genus and family levels. In this analysis, ALG and RS samples were compared to CON samples and the taxa with P value smaller than 0.01 were included in the plots. Calypso version 3.4 (http://bioinfo.qimr.edu.au/calypso/) was used to generate bubble plot to observe time-dependent changes. Each data point on bubble plot shows the mean relative abundance of bacterial families for the indicated time-point and was determined from fecal samples of three pigs that were fed with the same diet. Pearson’s correlations between the bacterial families were calculated and plotted using Calypso Version 3.4. To evaluate the interactions between gut bacteria and PCWCs over time, extended local similarity analysis (eLSA) [65,66] was performed. Cytoscape 2.7.0 [67] was used to process eLSA outputs and generate correlation networks. eLSA output was filtered by local similarity score (LS) and P value (P < 0.001) to reduce the number of nodes.

The housing, feeding, and sampling of the animals were performed at the Nutreco Swine Research Centre facilities (Sint Anthonis, The Netherlands), and all experimental protocols describing the management, animal care, and sampling procedures were reviewed and approved by The Animal Care and Use Committee of Wageningen University (Wageningen, The Netherlands, DEC nr. 2011088.c).
