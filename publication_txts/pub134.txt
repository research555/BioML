Establishment of a Macaca fascicularis gut microbiome gene catalog and comparison with the human, pig, and mouse gut microbiomes

Macaca fascicularis, the cynomolgus macaque, is a widely used model in biomedical research and drug development as its genetics and physiology are close to those of humans. Detailed information on the cynomolgus macaque gut microbiota, the functional interplay between the gut microbiota and host physiology, and possible similarities to humans and other mammalians is very limited. The aim of this study was to construct the first cynomolgus macaque gut microbial gene catalog and compare this catalog to the human, pig, and mouse gut microbial gene catalogs. We performed metagenomic sequencing on fecal samples from 20 cynomolgus macaques and identified 1.9 million non-redundant bacterial genes of which 39.49% and 25.45% are present in the human and pig gut bacterial gene catalogs, respectively, whereas only 0.6% of the genes are present in the mouse gut bacterial gene catalog. By contrast, at the functional levels, more than 76% Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthologies are shared between the gut microbiota of all four mammalians. Thirty-two highly abundant bacterial genera could be defined as core genera of these mammalians. We demonstrated significant differences in the composition and functional potential of the gut microbiota as well as in the distribution of predicted bacterial phage sequences in cynomolgus macaques fed either a low-fat/high-fiber diet or a high-fat/low-fiber diet. Interestingly, the gut microbiota of cynomolgus macaques fed the high-fat/low-fiber diet became more similar to the gut microbiota of humans.

The intestine is home to trillions of bacteria, which in number equal or even outnumber the number of host cells [1]. Accumulating evidence points to a link between the gut microbiota and several common diseases, including obesity [2–4], diabetes [5, 6], Crohn's disease [7], ulcerative colitis [8], rheumatoid diseases [9], cardiovascular disease [10, 11], and colorectal cancer [12]. Recent evidence also links changes in the gut microbiota to certain mental disorders [13, 14].

Previous studies have explored the gut microbiota of different monkey species using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, providing little information on gene identity and function of the monkey gut microbiome [18–21]. In the present study, fecal samples from 20 cynomolgus macaques were used for metagenomics sequencing, resulting in the generation of a catalog comprising 1.9M NR bacterial genes. Comparison of the human, pig, mouse, and cynomolgus macaque gut microbiomes demonstrated that the cynomolgus macaque gut microbiome is more similar to that of human than those of pig and mouse at the gene level. We observed that the gut microbiota of cynomolgus macaques fed either a low-fat/high-fiber diet or a high-fat/low-fiber diet exhibited differences in composition and functional potential, which to a certain degree mimicked those observed in humans shifted between intake of a low-fat/high-fiber diet and a high-fat/low-fiber diet [22]. We envisage that the present gut bacterial gene catalog and the functional characterization will serve as a valuable reference and resource for biomedical research using the cynomolgus macaque as a model.

To establish a M. fascicularis, the cynomolgus macaque, gut microbial gene catalog, fecal samples from 20 cynomolgus macaque individuals were collected. The animals were divided into two groups and fed either a low-fat/high-fiber diet or a high-fat/low-fiber diet for three months. Further details are given in the Methods section. Total DNA was extracted from freshly collected fecal samples from all animals and used for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform as described previously [1]. In total, 140 Gb of data were generated, with an average of 7 Gb per sample (Additional File 1). The raw data were filtered with a quality-control cutoff (adapter sequence <15 bp, “N” base < 3bp, Q >20, final length >30), and host sequences were removed by alignment against the M. fascicularis genome (National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] accession no. NC_02 2272.1 - NC_02 2292.1), resulting in 131 Gb of clean data used for assembly and open reading frames (ORFs) prediction using SOAPdenovo [23] and Metagene2 [24], respectively. Redundant ORFs from each sample were removed by CD-HIT [25], providing a 1.9-M NR cynomolgus macaque gut microbial gene catalog. The gene profiles were generated by mapping clean data to the gene catalog with soap2.22 [26]. The genes in the catalog were aligned against the NCBI-NR, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [27], and the carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) [28] database to obtain taxonomic and functional annotation.

De novo assembly, gene prediction, and elimination of redundant genes were performed as previously described [29], generating a NR geneset comprising 1,991,169 ORFs with an average length of 757 bp.

We could taxonomically classify 65.68% of the NR genes with CARMA3 [30]. More than 99.99% of the annotated genes could be assigned to the bacteria superkingdom. Of these genes, 1,068,246 (53.65%) could be annotated to the phylum level. At the phylum level, 52.94% of the annotated genes could be annotated to Firmicutes and 21.25% of the genes could be annotated to Bacteroidetes. At the genus and the species level, 276,920 (13.91%) and 20,262 (1.02%) of the macaque gut bacterial genes could be annotated to the genus and the species level, respectively (Fig.
1b). At the genus level, most of the annotated genes (34.55%) belonged to Prevotella, followed by Ruminococcus (9.91%), Clostridium (6.73%), Eubacterium (6.12%), and Bacteroides (6.00%) (Fig.
1b). We also mapped the cynomolgus macaque gene catalog to the KEGG database [27]. We could map 1,057,148 (53.09%) genes to KEGG orthology (KO) levels, of which 775,931 (38.97%) genes had pathway information. Pathways related to genetic information processing (replication and repair and translation), metabolism (carbohydrates, amino acids, energy, and nucleotides), and environmental information processing (membrane transport) (Additional File 2a) dominated. Additionally, we mapped the cynomolgus macaque gut bacterial gene catalog to the CAZy database. We were able to map 67,995 (3.41%) of the cynomolgus macaque gut bacterial genes to 248 CAZy families (Additional File 2b).

Based on the taxonomical annotation, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the two main phyla (Fig.
2a) and Prevotella and Bacteroides were the dominant genera (Fig.
2b) in the cynomolgus macaque gut microbiota. We found 80 core genera that were shared among all individuals with a lowest average abundance higher than 2.04e-07 (Additional File 3).

We identified three enterotype-like clusters in these 20 individual cynomolgus macaque samples, primarily driven by the highly abundant genera Prevotella, Lactobacillus, and Ruminococcus (Additional File 4a and 4b).

The cynomolgus macaque gut bacterial catalog was compared with the human [31], pig [32], and mouse [15] catalogs. The human gut gene catalog includes 9,879,896 genes, the pig gut gene catalog includes 7,685,872 genes, and the mouse gut gene catalog includes 2,572,074 genes (Additional File 5). In the cynomolgus macaque gut bacterial gene catalog, 39.49% of the genes are included in the human gut bacterial gene catalog, 25.45% of the genes are present in the pig gut bacterial gene catalog, whereas only 0.6% of the genes are found in the mouse gut gene catalog. Moreover, less than 0.4% of cynomolgus macaque gut genes are shared by these four species, underscoring the marked differences between the gut microbiomes of these mammalian species at the gene level (Fig.
3a).

We compared the enterotype-like clusters of the cynomolgus macaque, the mouse, and the pig to human. In the human gut microbiota, enterotype-like clusters have been reported to be driven by Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Ruminococcus [12, 22, 33–35], and, in some cases, Bifidobacterium [5], Alistipes, and Faecalibacterium [36]. In the cynomolgus macaque, we found that the enterotype-like clusters were driven by Lactobacillus, Prevotella, and Ruminococcus. In the mouse, the enterotype-like clusters were driven by Alistipes, Akkermansia, and Clostridium. In the pig, we observed that enterotype-like clusters were driven by Streptococcus, Prevotella, and Lactobacillus (Additional File 4). Based on the networks of the 32 core genera of these four mammals (Additional Files 9 and 10), we also analyzed the relationship of these enterotype-representative genera with other genera. We found that Prevotella correlated negatively with Bacteroides in human gut microbiota, but in cynomolgus macaque and pig microbiotas, Prevotella correlated positively with Bacteroides. Additionally, in the human and cynomolgus macaque gut microbiotas, Ruminococcus correlated positively with both Blautia and Dorea. Differences in enterotypes in humans have been linked to dietary patterns [22, 37]. However, to what extent the different patterns of enterotype-like clusters in these four species reflect differences in diets and/or genetics remains to be established. The finding that colonization by human microbiotas in germ-free mice only partial indicates that genetics may play a role [38–40].

Comparison of cynomolgus macaques fed the low-fat/high-fiber or the high-fat/low-fiber diets for three months revealed that the latter group on average had slightly higher body mass (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P value <0.05) and elevated fasting blood glucose (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P value <0.05) (Additional File 11). Notably, the reads from cynomolgus macaque individuals that had consumed the high-fat/low-fiber diet showed a significantly higher mapping rate to the human and the pig genesets (P value = 2.06e-04 in human and P value = 3.25e-04 in pig), but not to the mouse gene sets (P value = 0.14). In response to these diets, we observed changes of alpha diversity. Intake of the high-fat/low-fiber diet tended to decrease alpha diversity, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P value = 0.14) (Additional File 7b). However, individuals fed the high-fat/low-fiber diet could be clearly distinguished from the control group at the gene level (Fig.
4a). We found that 82,120 gene markers differed in abundance comparing the two groups (P value <0.01). Most of these marker genes are involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, nucleotides, and vitamins.

Analysis of genera that differed significantly in abundance between the two groups of cynomolgus macaques was performed (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P value <0.05). We found five genera, including Parabacteroides and Succinatimonas, being enriched in individuals fed the high-fat/low-fiber diet, whereas in the gut microbiota of individuals fed the low-fat/high-fiber diet, 11 genera, including Ruminococcus, Roseburia, and Eubacterium, were enriched (Additional File 12). KOs involved in carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, membrane transport, and transcription were more abundant in individuals fed the high-fat/low-fiber diet compared to the low-fat/high-fiber diet (Fig.
4b). At the module or pathway level, the gut microbiota of cynomolgus macaques fed a high-fat/low-fiber diet was functionally enriched in saccharide, polyol, and lipid transport systems; phosphate and amino acid transport systems; and metabolic modules involved in branched-chain amino acid, carbohydrate, lipid, and methane metabolism. The gut microbiota of cynomolgus macaques fed a low-fat/high-fiber diet was functionally enriched in bacterial secretion system, protein export, purine metabolism, and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (Additional Files 13 and 14). Since the two diets differ both in fat and fiber content, the observed changes most likely reflect changes in both of these constituents. Differences in the composition and functional potential of the gut microbiota in response to a low-fat/high-fiber diet or a high-fat/low-fiber diet have also been reported in a human study [22]. We observed that some of the KEGG pathways that differed in abundance in the human study in response to the different diet, including bacterial secretion system and protein export, also differed in response to the two diets in cynomolgus macaques.

In total 311,017 (15.62%) of the genes in the cynomolgus macaque gut gene catalog were predicted as bacterial phage sequences by Metafinder [41] (ANI >1.7%). Similar ratios of phage genes in the human, mouse, and pig gut gene catalogs were also predicted using the same pipeline (Additional File 15). By comparing the distribution of these predicted phage genes between cynomolgus macaques fed the high-fat/low-fiber diet and low-fat/high-fiber diet, 56,800 gene were found to differ significantly in abundance between the two groups (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P < 0.05) (Additional File 16). Of these, 43,602 were enriched in the control group, while 13,198 genes were enriched in macaques fed the high-fat/low-fiber diet. Additionally, the heat map clearly separated these genes between the two diet groups (Additional File 17).

Here, we constructed a gut bacterial gene catalog of M. fascicularis, the cynomolgus macaque, comprising 1,991,169 NR genes and compared it with the human, mouse, and pig gut bacterial gene catalogs. This catalog represents the first geneset generated from an NHP and provides a comprehensive reference resource for metagenomics-based research. The comparison with human, pig, and mouse demonstrates that the overlap between different mammals is very modest at the gene level but high at the KO functional level. Jonathan et al. reported that the gut microbiotas of captive NHPs have undergone humanization [18]. Our results also show that the cynomolgus macaque gut microbiome is more similar to the human gut microbiome than the other analyzed mammalian species. However, the degree of similarity is only slightly greater, and the comparisons emphasize the quite large differences at the gene levels among the cynomolgus macaque, human, pig, and mouse. However, similarity at the functional level is high between all species. Thus, from a purely metagenomics point of view, the use of cynomolgus macaques for biomedical research needs more research. Based on the high genetic similarity between human and cynomolgus macaque, it will be of interest to determine if colonization with human microbiotas will be more efficient in cynomolgus macaque than in pig or mouse. We demonstrate that intake of diets with different content of fat and fiber elicited pronounced differences in the gut microbiota of cynomolgus macaques and that some of these differences recapitulated differences in humans ingesting a low-fat/high-fiber diet or a high-fat/low-fiber diet [22].

A previous case-control comparison of enteric viromes in captive rhesus macaques showed several viruses associated with idiopathic chronic diarrhea [42]. We explored the presence of bacteria phages in the cynomolgus macaque gut microbiome. Interestingly, 15.6% of the genes in the current cynomolgus macaque gut gene catalog could be annotated as bacterial phages. Furthermore, the relative abundance of a subset of these phages differed significantly between cynomolgus macaques fed the low-fat/high-fiber diet and those fed the high-fat/low-fiber diet, underscoring that phages are abundant in the gut and may change in abundance in response to dietary intake. Thus, phages may play an important role in gut homeostasis, but the difference in relative abundance in response to dietary intake may also simply reflect changes in the relative abundance of their bacterial hosts [11].

Fresh feces from 20 cynomolgus macaques (M. fascicularis) aged 13–16 years were sampled. The animals were housed at room temperature with a 12-hour light/dark cycle at the JinJieKang Biotechnology Company, Yunnan, China, following guidelines approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the JinJieKang Biotechnology Company. The animals had ad libitum access to water. The animals were divided into two groups of 10 animals. Ten males were fed a low-fat/high-fiber diet (8% of energy from fat, 131 g fiber/kg), and nine males and one female were fed a high-fat/low-fiber diet (39% of energy from fat, 20 g fiber/kg) for three months. After three months, the animals were weighed and blood was collected for blood glucose measurements at Kunming Jinyu Medical Laboratory Co., Ltd. Fresh feces were collected, immediately frozen, and kept on dry ice during transportation to BGI Shenzhen for further processing.

DNA extraction was performed using 200 mg feces per sample following the method reported by Qin et al [29], except that cell lysis was performed by bead beating the samples twice for 30 seconds with an incubation of 2 minutes on ice between beatings. The concentration of fecal DNA was measured using Nanodrop. Following the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina), we constructed one DNA paired-end library with an insert size of 350 bp for each sample. Metagenomic sequencing was performed on the Illumina 2000 platform using a 100-bp paired-end strategy.

Raw reads were filtered with a quality-control cutoff (adapter sequence <15 bp, “N” base <3 bp, Q >20, final length >30) and host genomic DNA (NCBI accession no. NC_02 2272.1 - NC_02 2292.1). An average of 3.49% of the raw reads, which were of low quality or mapped to the host genome DNA, were removed. The remaining reads were considered high-quality reads. We obtained 131 Gb of high-quality data with an average of 6.55 Gb per sample. To construct a cynomolgus macaque gut microbial gene catalog, we assembled the Illumina reads from each sample into longer contigs with the SOAPdenovo2 software (SOAPdenovo2, RRID: SCR_01 4986) [23, 29]. A total of 56.43% of the reads were assembled into 2.02 million contigs with a length exceeding 500 bases. Metagene2 [24, 29] was used to predict ORFs in contigs obtained for each sample, with an average 220,862 ORFs per sample. An NR geneset comprising ∼1.9 M genes was constructed by pairwise comparison of all genes in all samples, using CD-HIT (CD-HIT, RRID:SCR_007105) [25] with identity of >95% and overlap of >90%. Taxonomic assignments (taxonomic database: version March 2012) were made using CARMA3 [30] on the basis of Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for Proteins (BLASTP) against the NCBI-NR database (version September 2013, the same version used for the mouse and pig gut microbiome catalogs).

We translated the nucleotide sequences of gene catalog into amino acid sequences, then aligned against the proteins or domains in eggNOG v3 (eggNOG, RRID:SCR_002456) [43] and KEGG v59 (KEGG, RRID:SCR_012773) [27] databases using BLASTP (v2.2.24, default parameter except that -F: F). KEGG annotation was performed using an in-house pipeline, where each protein was assigned to a KO when the highest-scoring annotated hit(s) contained at least one alignment over 60 hits.

High-quality reads from each sample were aligned against the gene catalog by SOAP2.22 (SOAPaligner/soap2, RRID:SCR_005503) [26] (with default parameters except for -r 2 -l 30 -M 4 -p 2 -v 10). The relative abundance of each gene in each sample was determined as previously described [5].

For the relative abundance profile at the genus level, we used the phylogenetic assignment of each gene and summed the relative abundance of genes from the same genus to calculate the abundance of a particular genus. The relative abundance of each genus in a sample constituted the genus profile of that sample. Using the same method, the relative abundance of each KO was calculated from the sum of the relative abundances of the corresponding genes.

One-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed for all the KOs that occurred in more than five samples and adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure. The Z-score for each KO could then be calculated:

The Zadjustedpathway was used as the final reporter score for evaluating the enrichment of specific pathways or modules. A reporter score of 1.6 (90% confidence according to normal distribution) could be used as a detection threshold for significantly differentiating pathways. This is the same procedure as previously described [44, 45].

Rarefaction analysis was performed to assess the gene richness. For a given number of samples, we performed random sampling 100 times in the cohort with replacement and estimated the total number of genes present in these samples by the Chao1 richness estimator [46].

Genus relative abundances were used for analysis of partitioning around means (PAM)-based enterotypes-like clusters in cynomolgus macaque, pig, and mouse samples [15, 32]. In this study, the R package “stats” was used to perform a hierarchical clustering of samples using Jensen-Shannon distances followed by PCA using the R package “ade4.”

The human [31], mouse [15], and pig [32] gut genesets were compared to the cynomolgus macaque geneset. If two and more genes had >95% identity and >90% overlap with the query, we considered the genes to be identical. For comparison at the functional level, shared KOs were identified and computed by unique KO ID.

We analyzed differences in abundance at the phylum, genus, and species level using Wilcoxon rank sum test (P <0.05).

To identify associations between metagenome profiles and the two diets, a 2-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test [5] implemented in R (R package stats) was used.

Phage genes were identified from the human, mouse, pig, and cynomolgus macaque gut gene catalogs using Metafinder [41] (ANI >1.7%). Phage genes that differed in abundance between samples from cynomolgus macaques fed the low-fat/high-fiber diet and the high-fat/low-fiber diet were selected by Wilcoxon rank sum test (P < 0.05).

The metagenomic shotgun sequencing data for all samples have been deposited in the EBI database under the accession code PRJEB22765. Supplemental data are available in the GigaScience database, GigaDB [47]. The data has also been uploaded to the China National GeneBank (CNGB) Microbiome Database, from which they can be accessed at https://db.cngb.org/microbiome/genecatalog/macaca_fascicularis.
