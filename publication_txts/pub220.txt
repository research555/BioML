Regional Diets Targeting Gut Microbial Dynamics to Support Prolonged Healthspan

In the last 150 years, we have seen a significant increase in average life expectancy, associated with a shift from infectious to non-communicable diseases. The rising incidence of these diseases, for which age is often the largest risk factor, highlights the need for contemporary societies to improve healthy ageing for their growing silver generations. As ageing is an inevitable, non-reversing and highly individualised process, we need to better understand how non-genetic factors like diet choices and commensal gut microbes can modulate the biology of ageing. In this review, we discuss how geographical and ethnic variations influence habitual dietary patterns, nutrient structure, and gut microbial profiles with potential impact on the human healthspan. Several gut microbial genera have been associated with healthy elderly populations but are highly variable across populations. It seems unlikely that a universal pro-longevity gut microbiome exists. Rather, the optimal microbiome appears to be conditional on the microbial functionality acting on regional- and ethnicity-specific trends driven by cultural food context. We also highlight dietary and microbial factors that have been observed to elicit individual and clustered biological responses. Finally, we identify next generation avenues to modify otherwise fixed host functions and the individual ageing trajectory by manipulating the malleable gut microbiome with regionally adapted, personalised food intervention regimens targeted at prolonging human healthspan.

While ageing is an inherent genetically determined biological process, the chronological outcome of an individual’s lifespan is extraordinarily variable. Remarkably, so-called “blue zones” have been identified around the world where the proportion of centenarians (i.e., people who are 100 years old or more) is significantly higher than in neighbouring communities (Buettner and Skemp, 2016), but there are no validated biological explanations for these age-privileged cultural hotspots. At present, the global centenarian population is estimated to be between 500,000 and 600,000 (Robine and Cubaynes, 2017).

In recent decades, we have seen remarkable progress in understanding how molecular pathways are linked to the ageing process, leading to the conceptualisation of nine molecular “Hallmarks of Ageing” (López-Otín et al., 2013), and spurring research into modifiable or druggable molecular targets within each hallmark (Campisi et al., 2019). Despite sharing common hallmarks, the ageing process is still highly individualised as evident by the increased variability in organ function and inter-organ crosstalk (Steves et al., 2012). For example, Ahadi et al. (2020) characterised the variability of ageing with 184 individual molecular markers, which can be grouped into four partially overlapping domains of ageing or ageotypes: immunological, metabolic, hepatic, and renal. They observed that individuals tended to age asymmetrically, displaying different rates of ageing between the domains (Ahadi et al., 2020). Hence, to achieve a comprehensive and clinically applicable understanding of ageing, insights into common molecular principles of ageing must be accompanied by a decipherment of variability and individuality of the ageing process as well as underlying and modifiable factors behind this variability (Figure 2). The imminent need to address how environmental and lifestyle factors drive the individuality of the ageing process is therefore highly warranted and certainly within the vision of the twenty-first century of precision medicine.

Increasingly, gut microbes and their plethora of genes and secreted molecules are being recognised as an integral part of the holobiont (Figure 3), where the human host and prokaryotic microbial counterparts coexist to mutually benefit and function as a meta-organism (Byndloss and Bäumler, 2018). While the human genome is fixed at birth, the gut microbiome is dynamic, characterised by a rapid cellular turnover (average of 5 days, in the human host) (Sender and Milo, 2021) and can be considered superior in its plasticity to transcriptionally respond to dietary interventions as compared to host eukaryotic cells (Figure 3). This highlights the potential to target the gut microbiota to alleviate, for example, accelerated ageing by dietary interventions. The observation that gut microbes display considerable changes in composition (and by extension, their functions as a community) in many age-associated non-communicable diseases (Byndloss and Bäumler, 2018) allows for prospective dietary interventions to be applied in situations where impairments in microbe-microbe functions and/or dysfunctional microbe-host interactions are driving the disease. It is tempting to speculate that the spectrum of symptoms associated with accelerated ageing may in part be reversed or mitigated due to the dynamic nature of the gut microbiome.

Accumulating evidence points to diet as a central determinant of gut microbial composition. A study into South East Asian populations of various ethnic origins showed that diet overruled ethnicity, lifestyle, and environmental factors in determining the gut microbial configuration (Khine et al., 2019), confirming an Israeli cohort study, which found no significant association between genetic ancestry and microbial composition (Rothschild et al., 2018). In contrast, the Dutch HELIUS study identified ethnicity as a strong determinant of microbial composition [main operational taxonomic units (OTU) characterised as Prevotella in Moroccans, Turks, and Ghanaians, Bacteroides in African Surinamese and South-Asian Surinamese, and Clostridales in the Dutch] (Deschasaux et al., 2018). However, the same study also showed that there was a strong correlation between ethnicity and dietary pattern, suggesting that diet might account for inter-ethnic differences (Deschasaux et al., 2018). Additionally, ethnicity comprises other aspects such as cultural habits, socioeconomic status, health care, antibiotics use, and early-life environment, which may all contribute to shape the gut microbiome in a specific fashion by determining nutrient availability and xenobiotic exposure. Furthermore, differences in early-life colonisation trajectories by maternal microbes may shape organ-to-organ communication, immune system development, maturation of epithelial linings, and tuning of brain development and function.

Dietary pattern and gut microbial composition correlate with longevity and markers of healthy ageing. Simultaneously, the dynamic interaction between diet and microbes is interwoven: diet regulates the phylogenetic structure and biological activity of the gut microbes, whereas the microbes, in turn, regulate the presence and/or bioactivity of food molecules through their metabolism and biotransformation (Rowland et al., 2018). Hence, understanding the relationship between diet, gut microbes, diet-gut microbe interactions, and host organ function is of utmost importance if we aim to intervene in the individualised ageing process to improve health and healthspan in the ageing population through personalised nutritional interventions.

Centenarians, who have escaped or survived lethal diseases earlier in life, may be considered a spontaneous model of healthy ageing. The gut microbial composition of centenarians has consistently been reported to differ in phylogenetic composition from that of younger people. Interestingly, within centenarian populations, species have been reported to display regional characteristics, further supporting that environmental and/or lifestyle factors including the diet, shape microbial composition (Figure 4). For example, in an Italian cohort, the centenarian microbiome was found to be dominated by the same two microbial families as in the other age groups (<75 years old) of the population, namely Veillonellaceae and Ruminococcaceae (Firmicutes phylum), but was specifically enriched in the genera Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, and Christensenella (Biagi et al., 2016). In contrast, the Chinese Hainan Centenarian Cohort was dominated by Bacteroides (Bacteroidetes phylum) and Escherichia (Proteobacteria phylum) (Luan et al., 2020). Long-term elderly care residents in the Irish ELDERMET Cohort also had a gut microbiome dominated by Bacteroidetes (Claesson et al., 2012). Importantly, although the aggregate faecal microbiome in ELDERMET was dominated by Bacteroidetes, the residents showed extraordinary inter-individual variation with 3–92% Bacteroidetes and 7–94% Firmicutes, hinting at a long-term effect of their dietary habits (Claesson et al., 2012).

Additionally, the phylogenetic composition of the gut microbiome might not accurately represent the functional output as species across genera are often able to perform similar metabolic processes. It is of interest for future studies to complement phylogenetic analysis with metabolomics and proteomics of the host blood and faecal material. For example, the abundance of microbial tryptophan synthase (TrpB) and tryptophanase (TnaA) responsible for synthesising tryptophan and indole, respectively, was reduced in a Spanish cohort of elderly (65–85 years old) compared to infants (2–5 years old) and young adults (24–45 years old) (Ruiz-Ruiz et al., 2020). Homologues of TnaA were previously identified in >85 species in a variety of genera including Escherichia, Shigella, Porphyromonas, Clostridium, Enterobacter, etc. (Lee and Lee, 2009).

In the Western world, the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) is widely regarded as a “healthy diet” and adherence to this diet or diets with similar macronutrients content has been associated with longevity and reduced risks of age-related non-communicable diseases in culturally diverse populations (Roman et al., 2008). There is no consensus on the exact MedDiet structure, but it is characterised by high consumption of plant-based foods rich in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, and olive oil, followed by moderate consumption of fish, dairy products, and low consumption of red meat.

However, not all longevity regions exhibit adherence to the MedDiet structure. For instance, centenarians from Hainan, a region recognised by the International Expert Committee of Population Aging and Longevity as a World Longevity Island for its highest percentage of centenarians (18.75/100,000) in China, scored only 7.7 (±1.9) out of 18 on the MEDI-LITE adherence score, significantly lower than their Italian counterparts (Luan et al., 2020). This suggests that although the MedDiet pattern seems beneficial across genetic groups and cultures, some regions may benefit from developing dietary guidelines better suited to their geographical and cultural climates. Additional studies evaluating the effects of nutritional intervention on diseases, ageing, and longevity must consider geographical variation.

Dietary patterns, stemming from variations in culture, beliefs, and availability of food across seasons, are evidently different regionally and an important determinant driving gut microbial diversity and richness. Generally, shifting from a low-fat, high-fibre (“healthy”) diet to a high-fat, high-sugar, high-protein, low-fibre (“unhealthy”) diet leads to decreased α-diversity (i.e., intra-individual microbial richness), increased β-diversity (i.e., inter-individual microbial diversity), and decreased abundance of species (e.g., Prevotella and Treponema) (De Filippo et al., 2010). Furthermore, food additives commonly used in ultra-processed foods (e.g., emulsifiers, artificial sweeteners, salt) and Maillard reaction products (e.g., pyrazines and furans that are formed during thermal processing) were recently demonstrated to decrease α-diversity in the Milieu Intérieur study, while increasing the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes (F:B) ratio (Partula et al., 2019), which has been previously associated with obesity and cardiovascular diseases.

These studies, collectively, indicate local and global variations in the human gut microbiome, which are attributed to dietary cultures and choices. A common nutritional feature of healthy or longevity diets seems to be the frequent consumption of a minimally processed plant-based diet rich in complex carbohydrates, fruits, vegetables, soy-bean based foods, nuts, and seafood, which emphasises a “healthy fat” profile (i.e., higher in unsaturated fats and omega-3, and lower in saturated fat). The healthy fat being a likely mechanism for reducing inflammation, optimising cholesterol and other risk factors (Nishijima et al., 2016), and when combined with the lower caloric density of plant-rich diets and concomitant high intake of bioactive phytonutrients, jointly reduce risk for chronic age-related diseases and promote healthy ageing and longevity.

Studies of how diet affects healthspan are commonly limited to macronutrients (e.g., sugar, fat, vitamins) and structural components (e.g., dietary fibres). However, these nutritional components represent a small fraction of >26,000 phytonutrients described in foods1 ,2 such as polyphenols, terpenoids, alkaloids, and other plant secondary metabolites. Some of these compounds have been shown to nourish the gut microbiome, which in turn, metabolises these precursors into smaller molecular weight compounds, of which many serve a regulatory role. For instance, olive oil, a well-known ingredient in the MedDiet, has more than 200 unique compounds listed in specialised food metabolome databases (Kabaran, 2018), but only 60 and 8 common nutritional components in the US FoodData and Singapore Health Promotion Board nutrient composition databases, respectively. Barabasi adeptly described this untracked diversity of compounds in foods as the “dark matter of nutrition,” which remains largely invisible to epidemiological or hypothesis-driven nutritional studies (Barabási et al., 2020). Considering the chemical diversity of diets in different regions, it is necessary to further our understanding of the full chemical composition of specific foods and complex diets, to be able to map how our highly individualised gut microbiome responds to varying combinations of phytonutrients in geographically or culturally restricted fashions, and how to best employ the gut microbiome for personalised next-generation dietary interventions. In Supplementary Table 2, we highlight regional examples of known phytonutrients and functional foods, and their gut microbiome-associated trends that elicit individual and clustered biological responses that could be employed to improve health in an ageing population.

An individual’s genome may be fixed at conception, but its gut microbiome remains extraordinarily malleable throughout life with a fluctuating genetic composition that is able to respond to both host and dietary cues. By manipulating and utilising the diverse genetic pool of the gut microbiome with targeted dietary interventions, there is an untapped potential to complement and modify otherwise fixed host functions. Most dietary recommendations for the general population represent a “one-size-fits-all approach,” which does not ensure that everyone has adequate exposure to health-promoting constituents of foods. For example, dieticians have been using standardised glycaemic indices of food items to guide dietary recommendations in the last decade, but Zeevi et al. (2015) recently showed that glycaemic response to identical foods is in fact highly variable between people and largely dependent on their gut microbiome.

In summary, we must strive to better define individuals across an otherwise invariant chronological age range, to identify those at greater risk of accelerated ageing for healthspan intervention. Modifiable environmental and lifestyle factors such as our diet and gut microbiome represent accessible targets for prolonging healthspan, where we may introduce personalised dietary interventions to select for or to nurture the highly malleable gut microbiome to alter the ageing trajectory. The design of future diet intervention strategies should consider the chemical diversity of foods and inter-individual variability in biological responses with an emphasis on regional- and cultural-specific context.
