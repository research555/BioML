Antibiotic-Related Changes in Microbiome: The Hidden Villain behind Colorectal Carcinoma Immunotherapy Failure

The interplay between drugs and microbiota is critical for successful treatment. An accumulating amount of evidence has identified the significant impact of intestinal microbiota composition on cancer treatment response, particularly immunotherapy. The possible molecular pathways of the interaction between immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and the microbiome can be used to reverse immunotherapy tolerance in cancer by using various kinds of interventions on the intestinal bacteria. This paper aimed to review the data available on how the antibiotic-related changes in human microbiota during colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment can affect and determine ICI treatment outcomes. We also covered the data that support the potential intimate mechanisms of both local and systemic immune responses induced by changes in the intestinal microbiota. However, further better-powered studies are needed to thoroughly assess the clinical significance of antibiotic-induced alteration of the gut microbiota and its impact on CRC treatment by direct observations of patients receiving antibiotic treatment.

The interplay between drugs and microbiota is critical for successful treatment. Therefore, pharmacomicrobiomics was proposed as a modern approach for assessing the interaction between medicines and microbiota composition. A growing amount of evidence suggests that intestinal microbiota composition significantly impacts cancer treatment response, particularly immunotherapy. It has been shown that specific intestinal bacteria may promote or suppress immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) effectiveness. The possible molecular pathways of such an interaction can be used to reverse immunotherapy tolerance in cancer by using various kinds of interventions on intestinal bacteria [1].

This paper aimed to review the data available on how the antibiotic-related changes in human microbiota during CRC treatment can affect and determine ICI treatment outcomes. We also cover the data that support the potential intimate mechanisms of both local and systemic immune responses induced by changes in the intestinal microbiota.

The intensive crosstalk between the host gut microbiota and the intestinal immune system is essential for the maturation of immune cells. The human microbiome is also involved in education and enabling the immune system to recognize potentially hazardous bacteria, thus avoiding invasion and infection.

Furthermore, lysates of Lactobacillus acidophilus also have enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4) blocking antibody in mice CRC models, associated with increased CD8+ T cells, decreased numbers of T regulatory cells (Tregs), and decreased M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment [22]. Interestingly, bacterial genotoxins from Bacteroides fragilis, Campylobacter jejuni, and Fusobacterium nucleatum could promote CRC development in patients via activation of CD4+ Th17 cell responses, mTOR signaling, and the NF-kB pathway, respectively [23,24]. Additionally, bacteria such as ETBF and Fusobacterium nucleatum can impair the effectiveness of traditional chemotherapy and ICIs. The variations in treatment results between right-sided and left-sided colon cancer can be explained by biofilms in the right colon [16], as discussed above.

The human intestinal flora has been subject to vigorous studies in recent years, mainly due to the advances in genetic techniques allowing for sequencing studies of unculturable bacteria. Metagenomic analyses of gut microbiome changes induced by antibiotics still involve mostly small (<100) cohorts of patients/volunteers, allowing much room for intragroup variability. These limitations were the primary and intrinsic weaknesses of the above analyses. Moreover, metagenomic analyses from animal models of the human intestinal microbiota are not a suitable replacement; for some more recent classes of antibiotics, such as carbapenems and polymixins, human metagenomic data are scarce, if any. Further work on larger populations will be needed to affirm the trends.

A schematic picture of ICI interactions with microbiota and immune cells is presented in Figure 1.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a new class of systemic anti-tumor agents, rendering the patient’s immune system to attack tumor cells. There are basically three types of ICIs currently implemented in clinical practice: anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies [34]. These relatively novel drugs have led to significant progress in managing metastatic tumors such as malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell cancer [35].

ICI, immune checkpoint inhibitor; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; NR, not reported; RCC, renal cell cancer; PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1.

Further better-powered studies discriminating between different antibiotics will be needed to fully understand the real-world clinical significance of antibiotic alteration of the gut microbiota and its impact on ICI treatment in CRC and other tumor types. We also have to admit that ICI effectiveness could depend on microbiome changes different from those observed in the gut only. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is another theater where bacterial flora confronts anti-tumor immunity [44]. This could be particularly relevant in gastrointestinal tumors, where the microbiome in the tumor microenvironment may not necessarily resemble that in the gut lumen. To date, data about the real impact of TME microbiome on ICI treatment clinical outcomes are lacking.

Apart from viruses, which are long known for their oncogenic potential, it turns out that bacteria are also involved in cancerogenesis, but in a much more complex manner: by modulating local and systemic anti-tumor immune responses. This is especially relevant for cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, where this issue is not related to a single “culprit,” but mostly to the fine balance in a community of microorganisms, properly termed by some as our “second organism.” Owing to its effect on a variety of disorders, including cancer, the microbiome attracts tremendous interest. Its function is increasingly evident when related to cancer therapies, especially when the intestinal microbiome regulation can impact the effectiveness and adverse effects of different types of cancer treatments.

The factors and treatments that affect the gut microbiome themselves are incredibly crucial. Convincing and direct data for the impact of antibiotic treatment, specifically on the clinical outcomes of ICI treatments, are scarce and have been unable to discriminate between the effects of different classes of antibiotics so far. Further better-powered studies are needed to thoroughly assess the clinical significance of antibiotic alteration of the gut microbiota and its impact on CRC treatment by direct observations on patients receiving antibiotic treatment.
