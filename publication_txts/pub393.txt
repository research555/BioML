Review article: emerging role of the gut microbiome in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and potential therapeutic implications

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent disorder associated with obesity and diabetes. Few treatment options are effective for patients with NAFLD, but connections between the gut microbiome and NAFLD and NAFLD‐associated conditions suggest that modulation of the gut microbiota could be a novel therapeutic option.

To examine the effect of the gut microbiota on pathophysiologic causes of NAFLD and assess the potential of microbiota‐targeting therapies for NAFLD.

A PubMed search of the literature was performed; relevant articles were included.

The composition of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract can enhance fat deposition, modulate energy metabolism and alter inflammatory processes. Emerging evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiome in obesity and metabolic syndrome. NAFLD is often considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, and there has been tremendous progress in understanding the association of gut microbiome composition with NAFLD disease severity. We discuss the role of the gut microbiome in NAFLD pathophysiology and whether the microbiome composition can differentiate the two categories of NAFLD: nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL, the non‐progressive form) vs nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, the progressive form). The association between gut microbiome and fibrosis progression in NAFLD is also discussed. Finally, we review whether modulation of the gut microbiome plays a role in improving treatment outcomes for patients with NAFLD.

Multiple pathophysiologic pathways connect the gut microbiome with the pathophysiology of NAFLD. Therefore, therapeutics that effectively target the gut microbiome may be beneficial for the treatment of patients with NAFLD.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterised by fat accumulation (or steatosis) in >5% of hepatocytes in individuals who either consume little alcohol or have no other secondary causes of steatosis such as viral hepatitis, lipodystrophy or medications associated with the development of steatosis.1, 2 The increasing prevalence of NAFLD parallels rises in the incidence of obesity and insulin resistance.3, 4 NAFLD is among the most common causes of liver disease and liver transplantation in the Western hemisphere.4, 5 NAFLD can be sub‐classified into two categories: the non‐progressive form, nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and the progressive form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).1, 6 NASH is a clinic‐pathologic entity that is typically characterised by the presence of zone 3 steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation; perisinusoidal fibrosis may or may not be also present.1, 7 Fibrosis progression rate is estimated to be higher in NASH than in NAFL and progression to cirrhosis may take up to 30 years; however, rapid progression to cirrhosis may occur in a small subset of patients.8 In addition, NASH is associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and all‐cause (cardiovascular and liver‐related) mortality.9, 10, 11

Accumulating evidence also implicates the gut microbiota in the development and progression of NAFLD18, 19 and suggests that therapeutic agents that target the gut microbiota may be beneficial. This review examines the pathophysiologic implications of altered gut microbiota in NAFLD and highlights recent progress in the development of microbiota‐targeting therapies for patients with liver disease.

A PubMed search was performed for English language articles published between January 1, 2002 and January 31, 2019. Search terms included “cirrhosis” or “insulin resistance” or “liver disease” or “metabolic syndrome” or “NAFLD” or “obesity” or “steatohepatitis” and “microbiome.” The search was initially limited to primary publications and those of human subjects; articles reporting animal studies were later retrieved to allow more thorough discussion of pathophysiology. An additional nonsystematic search was performed to gather data on the use of prebiotics, probiotics, symbiotics, synbiotics and antibiotics for NAFLD. A total of 230 articles were retrieved; of these, 60 articles were reviewed. In addition, the bibliographies of these 60 articles were reviewed for additional relevant articles to consider for inclusion.

The term “microbiota” refers to a community of microbes in an organism, whereas “microbiome” is used to refer to both the microbiota and the collective genomes and gene products of the microbiota living in or on an organism. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans contains 10 trillion to 100 trillion bacteria, with approximately 15 000‐36 000 species.20, 21 Composition of the gut microbiota varies among individuals as the result of multiple intrinsic (eg, age22, 23) and extrinsic (eg, method of feeding after birth24, 25 and geographic region inhabited26) aspects.

Progressing along the human GI tract from the jejunum to the colon, the number and the diversity of bacteria increases,27 and the predominant bacterial species change. In the upper GI tract (oesophagus and proximal small bowel), Streptococcus species predominate,28, 29 whereas in the colon, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are most prevalent.20, 21, 30, 31, 32 These locational alterations likely reflect the overall functionality of the dominant species (eg, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes convert dietary complex carbohydrates and insoluble oligosaccharides to short‐chain fatty acids [SCFAs], which can be absorbed by the host within the intestines).33

Gut microbiota play a key immunomodulatory role, interacting closely with macrophages, dendritic cells, gut‐associated lymphoid tissues, B cells and T cells.43 For example, a healthy gut microbiome is integral to the proper development and function of T regulatory cells through a variety of cellular signalling mechanisms,44, 45, 46, 47 such as Clostridium butyricum inducing transforming growth factor‐β1 expression via toll‐like receptor (TLR)‐2 activation.48 Bacteria in the GI tract also participate in maintaining intestinal villous function34 and preventing intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis.49 In addition, alteration of the gut microbiota appears to have a role in intestinal disease (eg, inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]50, 51) and extraintestinal disease (eg, obesity,52, 53 diabetes43, 52, 53 and chronic liver disease54, 55). Furthermore, accumulating evidence supporting the role of the gut microbiota in drug metabolism (and corresponding effects on efficacy or adverse events) suggests that assessing microbiome activity could impact pharmaceutical drug development.56, 57

Metabolic syndrome is defined as the presence of any three of the following conditions: central obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance (or overt diabetes mellitus), hypertriglyceridemia and low levels of high‐density lipoproteinemia (HDL).58 Given the close association between NAFLD and obesity, insulin resistance and TG levels,59 NAFLD is often considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome.60 Because gut microbiota play a key role in metabolism and energy production from dietary intake,61 it stands to reason that they are closely related to components of metabolic syndrome (eg, obesity and diabetes).

SCFAs also regulate various aspects of GI inflammation, such as neutrophil migration, T‐cell differentiation and macrophage expression of proinflammatory cytokines.82 Insulin resistance is often accompanied by low‐grade inflammation.83, 84 The movement of the GI bacterial product lipopolysaccharides [LPS] into intestinal capillaries may contribute to inflammation and insulin resistance.84 TLRs are a type of innate immune receptor that are thought to recognise LPS and other products of invading pathogenic bacteria.83 TLR knockout studies in mice are helping to elucidate the role of the gut microbiota in metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. For example, mice deficient in TLR‐5 developed features of metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance.85 The authors of this report suggested that changes in the composition of gut microbiota, resulting from loss of TLR‐5, induced the low‐grade inflammation that contributed to the symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Another report described mice with elimination of TLR‐4 specifically in hepatocytes.86 When these mice received a high‐fat diet, they became obese, but compared with control mice, these mice displayed enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced hepatic steatosis. Thus, hepatocytes are centrally involved in the effects of inflammation on metabolic control, with the gut microbiota making up a significant part of that inflammatory signal.86

The major NAFLD risk factors (ie, diet, obesity and insulin resistance) are closely connected with the gut microbiome (Figure
1).14, 62, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96 It is reasonable to speculate that the gut microbiota and the pathophysiology of NASH are closely intertwined. One study found that the gut microbiota play a large role in the development of NAFLD, by transplanting the gut microbiota from mice with diet‐induced NAFLD into germ‐free mice; NAFLD developed in the initially germ‐free mice.18 In humans, characterisation of the faecal microbiomes of 86 patients with biopsy‐proven NAFLD (n = 72, stages 0‐2 fibrosis; n = 14, stages 3‐4 [advanced] fibrosis) revealed that patients with NAFLD and advanced fibrosis had increased levels of Proteobacteria, whereas patients with mild fibrosis had increased levels of Firmicutes.19 In addition, 37 of 40 features that were predictors of advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD were related to the gut microbiota.

Although other studies have demonstrated increased blood ethanol levels associated with NASH and obesity,94, 107 the study conducted by Zhu et al was the first to demonstrate that patients with NASH have higher blood ethanol levels than obese patients, and related this finding to alcohol‐producing bacteria in the gut microbiome of NASH patients.88 The results from this study suggest that patients with NASH may be differentiated from healthy and obese patients by assessing the gut microbiome using stool samples. The authors postulated that the constant presence of bacteria‐derived ethanol in the patients with NASH supplied a source of reactive oxygen species that could, in turn, increase inflammation and fibrosis.88 Figure
2 summarises the effects of various factors involved in the development of fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with NAFL.19, 40, 41, 88, 108, 109

Although animal studies have linked gut dysbiosis to the severity of hepatic inflammation and/or fibrosis, the findings of preclinical studies do not necessarily translate to humans; however, few human studies have examined this connection in the NAFLD setting.110, 111 In a study comparing the gut microbiomes of 50 patients (healthy controls, patients with NAFL/simple steatosis and patients with NASH), patients with NASH had lower levels of Bacteroidetes and higher levels of Clostridium coccoides compared with both healthy controls and patients with NAFL (P < 0.05).110 In another study, examining the taxonomic composition of gut microbiota using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing with stool samples from 57 patients with biopsy‐proven NAFLD, 30 patients had F0/1 fibrosis stage disease and 27 patients had advanced fibrosis (defined as ≥ F2 fibrosis stage).111 Ten patients with F0/1 stage and 25 patients with ≥ F2 stage had NASH. Patients with NASH had higher levels of Bacteroides and a lower abundance of Prevotella compared with patients without NASH. In comparison to patients with F0/1 fibrosis stage, patients with advanced fibrosis (≥F2 fibrosis stage) had increased levels of Bacteroides and Ruminococcus and lower levels of Prevotella. A multivariate analysis revealed that NASH was associated with increased Bacteroides, whereas findings of increased Ruminococcus were associated with advanced fibrosis.

Neither of these studies had any subgroup analysis of patients with and without insulin resistance or other confounding variables that may also affect gut microbiota.19, 110, 111 However, there may be a future role for the gut microbiome to be used as a non‐invasive marker to determine the presence of NASH and advanced fibrosis. However, further studies, with larger cohorts, are needed before this marker can be recommended for diagnosis and prognosis of NASH. Thus, while additional studies are warranted to validate the promise of gut microbial profiling, the gut microbiome in these patient populations may one day serve as an emerging tool for non‐invasive diagnosis of disease severity and monitoring progression.

BA composition is influenced by gut microbiota, and BAs are also thought to play a role in the development of NAFLD.115 Compared with healthy controls, patients with NASH have been shown to have higher concentrations of total faecal BA, cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and BA synthesis, and a higher ratio of primary BA to secondary BA.95 BAs such as chenodeoxycholic acid bind to the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the intestines.116, 117 FXR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and plays a key role in the absorption and transport of BA into the liver, as well as de novo hepatic lipogenesis, very low‐density lipoprotein transport and TG metabolism.96, 115, 118 Mice deficient in FXR demonstrated increased hepatic TG and cholesterol content,119 whereas FXR stimulation has been seen to suppress NFκB signalling, leading to decreased hepatic inflammation.120 Of note, findings using the high‐fat diet murine model of NAFLD demonstrated that intestinal antagonism of FXR through the manipulation of gut microbiota resulted in decreased hepatic lipogenesis.115 Stimulation of FXR has also been shown to alter carbohydrate metabolism, phospho‐enolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expression and gluconeogenesis regulation.121

Glucose homeostasis is also governed by GLP‐1, which is stimulated by G‐protein coupled receptor 5 (TGR5). Because the ligands for TGR5 are gut bacteria‐derived secondary BAs, the gut microbiome may play a large part in both lipid metabolism (through FXR) and glucose homeostasis (through TGR5).96, 122 Animal models of NAFLD have shown reductions in hepatic steatosis after exposure to BA derivatives that are FXR agonists123; in the FXR Ligand Obeticholic Acid in NASH Treatment trial, improvement of hepatic steatosis and inflammation was observed in patients with NAFLD who received obeticholic acid.124

Historically, the mainstay of treatment for patients with NAFLD has been lifestyle modification (eg, diet, exercise and weight loss) and the correction of underlying risk factors (eg, tight control of T2DM).108 Most pharmacologic treatments for NAFLD are designed to improve insulin sensitivity (eg, metformin, thiazolidinediones liraglutide and sitagliptin), reduce oxidative stress (vitamin E, ursodeoxycholic acid and pentoxifylline) or downregulate fibrosis mechanisms (angiotensin receptor blockers).125 Unfortunately, these medications have not demonstrated consistent improvement in liver fibrosis.125, 126, 127 Alternatively, data are accumulating on the potential role of therapies that alter gut microbiota in the treatment of patients with NAFLD and NASH.

Prebiotics are indigestible foods that promote the growth of beneficial GI bacteria through the fermentation of the prebiotic into SCFA.128 Preclinical studies of prebiotics have shown improvement in biochemical and histologic markers of NAFLD.129 One randomised trial (placebo crossover design) has been published to date.130 In patients with biopsy‐proven NASH (n = 7), prebiotic administration (ie, oligofructose 16 g/d) significantly reduced hepatic levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST; P < 0.05 vs placebo) and nonsignificantly decreased TG concentrations compared with placebo after 8 weeks of treatment. However, a systematic review that included four clinical studies of patients with obesity‐related NAFLD did not support the use of prebiotics, due to a lack of study quality.131

Probiotics are living microorganisms that are ingested and improve the mucosal integrity of the GI tract through alteration of the gut microbiota (via competitive colonisation and by acidification of the GI lumen).128 To date, six double‐blind, randomised controlled trials,132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137 one open‐label, randomised controlled trial138 and one open‐label, single‐treatment trial139 have examined the effect of probiotics in patients with NAFLD (Table
1). The studies have reported improvement in several biochemical markers (eg, alanine aminotransferase [ALT], AST and TNF‐α). A systematic review that included three clinical studies examining the efficacy of probiotics in patients with NAFLD did not support their use in this patient population, due to a lack of high‐quality studies.131

Unfortunately, few studies have examined the effect of probiotics on histologic markers of NAFLD and NASH. In a 2013 meta‐analysis of randomised controlled trials, only four studies were available when patient inclusion was limited to those with histologically or radiologically diagnosed NAFLD.140 However, Alisi et al133 reported that obese children with histologically diagnosed NAFLD who received sachets of eight probiotic strains daily for 4 months (n = 22) had a significantly lower risk of “more severe” steatosis (vs “less severe” steatosis) compared with children who received placebo (n = 22).

Synbiotics (or symbiotics) are a combination of both a prebiotic and a probiotic, and represent an emerging area of therapeutic research in NAFLD. Malaguarnera et al141 evaluated 66 patients with histologically diagnosed NASH who were randomly assigned to receive 24 weeks of a synbiotic (Bifidobacterium longum plus a prebiotic [fructooligosaccharides]) or placebo. Both groups underwent lifestyle modification and a B vitamin regimen. Compared with the placebo arm, the active treatment arm had significantly lower TNF‐α and C‐reactive protein (CRP) levels, as well as histologic improvement (decreased hepatocellular injury, inflammation and steatosis) after treatment (P < 0.05).

In the largest double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial to date, 80 patients with ultrasound‐diagnosed NAFLD were randomly assigned to receive either a synbiotic (probiotics [Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium breve, B longum and Streptococcus thermophilus] and fructooligosaccharides) or placebo for 8 weeks. At the end of the intervention period, patients who received synbiotics had significantly reduced steatosis (as measured by ultrasound) vs baseline, whereas no significant improvement was observed in patients who received placebo.142 No significant differences in CRP, ALT or AST levels were observed between groups (adjusted for energy intake). In contrast, a study of 50 lean patients (ie, low or normal body mass index [BMI]) with NAFLD (patients had steatosis and elevated ALT) demonstrated significant reductions in fibrosis and hepatic steatosis, fasting blood sugar, TG levels and markers of inflammation after 28 weeks of synbiotic supplementation compared with placebo (P < 0.05).143

Several small trials, mostly in animal models, have analysed the effect of antibiotics on NAFLD. The mechanism of action for antibiotics is multifactorial and may include alterations in the gut microbiota composition, bacterial virulence and/or bacterial metabolic function,128 although the specific pathway differs with each antibiotic. In a murine model, improvement in NAFLD was observed after the administration of an antibiotic cocktail (bacitracin, neomycin and streptomycin).115 This improvement was hypothesised to be the result of alterations in gut microbiota and BA metabolism and reductions in intestinal FXR signalling, serum ceramides and fatty acid synthesis. Reduced levels of bile salt hydrolase, a bacterial enzyme that metabolises the BA, result in the retention of tauro‐beta‐muricholic acid in the ileum, which then inhibits FXR signalling within the intestinal wall, leading to decreased ceramide production.115 Decreased ceramide production causes hepatic SREBP1C inhibition and decreased hepatic fatty acid accumulation. These findings were replicated in a rat study that showed alterations in the tissue BA profile, steroid biosynthesis and FXR signalling pathways after streptomycin and penicillin administration.144 As in the previous study, elevated levels of tauro‐beta‐muricholic acid were observed, although this time in the liver.

Several human studies of antibiotics in NAFLD have assessed the effect of rifaximin, a nonsystemic antibiotic (Table
2).145, 146, 147 Rifaximin is currently indicated in the United States to prevent overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence and to treat travellers’ diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with diarrhoea.148, 149 Although one may hypothesise that rifaximin exerts its effect by altering the composition of the gut microbiota, data have shown only modest changes in the components of the gut microbiome in patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy after rifaximin treatment.150 Additionally, preclinical studies have indicated that the efficacy of rifaximin may be attributable to its beneficial effects on host cell physiology and bacterial gene expression.151, 152, 153

Faecal transplantation has been used successfully in the treatment of patients with refractory and recurrent Clostridium difficile.154, 155 Although no human studies have examined the role of faecal transplantation for NAFLD, this strategy may be a potential avenue for exploration. In mouse models of NAFLD, animals that underwent a faecal transplantation from wild‐type mice donors showed decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis156 and reduced intestinal permeability157 (Table
3). However, faecal transplantation is not without risks. For example, a 2015 case report documented that a previously lean patient with recurrent C difficile infection developed obesity after a faecal transplant from an obese donor.158

Abbreviations: b.i.d., twice daily; WT, wild type.

Studies in humans indicate that even in healthy individuals who donate stool for a faecal microbiota transplant (FMT), faeces from a select few patients (called “super donors”) may yield more FMT success than stool obtained from other healthy donors.160, 161 FMTs have been studied in the setting of C. difficile infection162 and in chronic illnesses, such as IBD,160, 161 IBS,163 constipation164 and neurologic conditions.165 Two separate studies assessing the efficacy of FMT in the treatment of IBD found that patients who had received stool transplants from a particular donor had a higher success rate in inducing clinical and endoscopic remission compared with patients who did not receive stool from the “super donors.”160, 161 FMTs using stool obtained from lean donors transplanted into patients with metabolic syndrome led to a greater degree of improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity compared with autologous FMT.166, 167 Thus far, the only factor that seems to predict a successful FMT is the diversity of gut microbiota in the donor; conversely, recipients who are able to increase their faecal microbiome diversity to a higher degree in response to FMT were more likely to have successful outcomes in treatment of the underlying disease.168, 169

The GI tract and the liver develop from the same embryologic origins in the foregut, and this close interrelationship is maintained. Obesity, diet and insulin resistance are common risk factors for the development of NAFLD,15, 83, 84 and these risk factors seem to have a strong connection with the gut microbiome.12 While diet and obesity play a role in the modification of bacteria in the gut microbiota, the bacteria, in turn, affect the ability of host cells to produce and absorb nutrient‐derived energy.34 SCFAs and the ratios of the different fatty acids produced by bacteria are affected by the predominant type of bacteria in the GI lumen. Excess production of certain SCFAs can lead to the accumulation of excess energy in the form of adipose tissue, and obese patients are found to have altered ratios of SCFAs compared with their lean counterparts.64, 66, 67, 68, 69 These GI bacteria also affect host lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity.77, 80, 170

Obesity and insulin resistance are also associated with increased intestinal permeability171, 172, 173 and, therefore, increased rates of bacterial translocation, which activates proinflammatory cascades.84, 170, 174, 175 Kupffer cell activation by bacterial products such as LPS results in oxidative stress and the development of hepatocyte inflammation and fibrosis. LPS also promote the development of hepatic TG accumulation and hepatic steatosis.12, 100, 112, 113 There is a strong association between bacterial translocation and the degree of hepatic decompensation in the setting of cirrhosis of any aetiology,174 and among gut microbiota, BA metabolism, FXR and hepatic steatosis and inflammation.115, 120, 121, 124 In addition, activation of TLRs by bacterial products results in increased systemic and hepatic inflammation, a major stimulus in the development of NASH and the progression to fibrosis.100, 112, 113 Thus, treatment options aimed at targeting the gut microbiome, or the downstream cell‐signalling effects of the microbiome, continue to be therapeutic targets for the treatment of patients with NAFLD.
