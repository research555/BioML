SARS-CoV-2-associated gut microbiome alteration; A new contributor to colorectal cancer pathogenesis



The emergence of a novel coronavirus, COVID-19, in December 2019 led to a global pandemic with more than 170 million confirmed infections and more than 6 million deaths (by July 2022). Studies have shown that infection with SARS-CoV-2 in cancer patients has a higher mortality rate than in people without cancer. Here, we have reviewed the evidence showing that gut microbiota plays an important role in health and is linked to colorectal cancer development. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a change in gut microbiota, which modify intestinal inflammation and barrier permeability and affects tumor-suppressor or oncogene genes, proposing SARS-CoV-2 as a potential contributor to CRC pathogenesis

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) appeared late in 2019 in Wuhan, China, led to a worldwide pandemic with more than 500 million confirmed infected cases and over 6 million deaths related to this infection as of July 2022 [1]. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus transmitted mainly through respiratory aerosol droplets and direct contact, which is the main source of human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2], [3], [4]. Spike glycoprotein (S1 domain) of the SARS-CoV2 recognizes and attaches to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors expressed on target cells to facilitate the attachment of the virus to the host cells [5]. Afterward, host protease TMPRSS2 cleaves S, manifesting the S2 binding domain and facilitating host cell infection [6].

Little is known about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the host microbiome, especially in the niche environment, for example, the association between gut microbiota and CRC. According to the American Cancer Society, new cases of CRC are estimated to reach more than 140,000, and deaths will reach more than 50,000 by 2020 in the United States. The precise underlying relationship between SARS-CoV-2-induced gut microbial changes and CRC will be critical in this study area. [32].

One of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States is CRC. Meanwhile, the molecular mechanism of its development is not fully understood. According to studies conducted in the United States, the prevalence of CRC increased by 2 % from 2007 to 2016 among adults younger than 55 years, prompting recommendations to lower the age for colonoscopy screening for CRC [32], [33], [34]. In the past decade, the gut microbiota and its critical role in human health have been highlighted by the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). This vital role of gut microbiota is due to its protective, nutritional, and metabolic activities. Recently, microbiota-derived metabolites have been shown as a possible inducer of carcinogenesis, suggesting gut microbiota as a potential contributor to CRC pathogenesis [2], [35], [36]. Anaerobic microbes inhabiting the large intestine ferment food components to produce a wide range of metabolites that contain significant fermentation products, including gases and organic acids in healthy adults. They also have short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid, as well as medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), such as oleic acid, lauric acid, and linoleic acid [37], [38]. These products are released into the lumen of the large intestine and act as signaling molecules between the host and bacteria [35]. Also, SCFAs have been shown to maintain the intestinal barrier and exert their anti-inflammatory effects by increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and promoting differentiation of T lymphocytes to regulatory subtype (T-reg) [39]. Notably, these processes in the gut create a multi-organ axis, including the "gut-lung axis" and the "gut-brain axis," which maintain a healthy homeostatic state of these systems that depend on metabolic products of the gut [40], [41].

A positive and negative relationship between gut microbiome composition and COVID-19 disease has been summarized in Fig. 1.

The most common feature of COVID-19 infection is respiratory symptoms. However, it can affect the digestive system and cause complications such as inflammation and intestinal blockage to diarrhea [60]. One theory is that SARS-CoV-2 disease downregulates ACE2, leading to decreased activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and increased autophagy, leading to intestinal dysbiosis and diarrhea [60]. The ACE expression has reduced in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 and mice injected with recombinant SARS protein. The downregulation, as mentioned above, may play a role in the pathogenesis of SARS and diseases developing into Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [61], [62], [63]. Another theory is that the small intestine is likely to be a critical site for exacerbating the systemic inflammatory response, where ACE2 inhibition leads to increased levels of angiotensinogen and hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin system, which in turn shuts down the amino acid transporter BA0T1 and subsequently leads to tryptophan deficiency in cells, which leads to decreased secretion of antimicrobial peptides and intestinal dysbiosis [64]. Recent studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 suffer from dysbiotic gut microbiota [65], [66], [67], [68], [69]. A study reported an alteration and correlation of the fecal microbiome of SARS-CoV-2 patients with the severity of the disease [30]. In patients with COVID-19, significant changes were observed in stool microbiomes with enrichment of opportunistic pathogens and reduction of beneficial compounds during hospitalization [70]. Surprisingly, following the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 and its respiratory symptoms, symbionts and intestinal dysbiosis reduction persisted during hospitalization [71]. The result of a study reported that Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides massiliensis and Bacteroides ovatus stool-derived COVID-19 patients have a negative correlation with ACE2 expression and viral load in the body [72].

In conditions of intestinal dysbiosis, microorganisms and damaged tissue in the body can degrade and become a source of nutrition, leading to a temporary oversupply of nutrition. This event increases inflammation during acute infection [103] and can trigger chronic diseases, such as malignancies [104]. For example, some excess nutrients from damaged tissue and a dysbiotic gut microbiome can be converted into lipid mediators that lead to lipotoxicity and other tissue damage, emphasizing the importance of nutritional status [105]. These obtained observations provide a basis for more significant research and help to find the relationship between changes in the gut microbiota due to COVID-19 infection and its association with an increased risk for the development or progression of CRC [106], [107]. Given the global prevalence of this virus and the diagnosis of CRC as the third most common cancer in both sexes in the United States, research into the related effects of these two diseases has become a great necessity. As soon as these questions are clarified and obscure questions are answered, it becomes possible to develop efficient probiotic therapies, which can maintain a more homeostatic environment for the gut during the disease, thereby increasing the survival rate in CRC. Fig. 2, Fig. 3 reveal the relationship between the gut microbiome and COVID-19 infection leading to CRC.

The long-term effects of infection by SARS-CoV-2 remain an ambiguous point of this pandemic. This is critical for those with significant co-morbidities before the onset of COVID-19. Cancer is only one of the listed diseases. Understanding the role of COVID-19 concerning cancer is extremely important due to immunosuppressive therapies and the multifaceted nature of this disease. When birth date is taken into account, those born in 1990 have twice the risk of colon cancer compared to those born around 1950 [32]. The critical role of gut microbiota in the development and health of CRC has been proven. Significant changes in gut microbiota and microbiota have been demonstrated in early studies in patients with COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a change in the intestinal microbiota. The consequences of this disorder include the abundance of opportunistic pathogens and the reduction of beneficial compounds, the overall reduction of microbial diversity, the absence of butyrate-producing bacteria, and F.nucleatum bacteremia. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2-associated gut microbiome alteration could be a new contributor to colorectal cancer pathogenesis that can be considered for therapeutic goals.
