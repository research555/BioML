Metagenome-wide association study of gut microbiome revealed novel aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis in the Japanese population

The causality and pathogenic mechanism of microbiome composition remain elusive in many diseases, including autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study aimed to elucidate gut microbiome’s role in RA pathology by a comprehensive metagenome-wide association study (MWAS).

We conducted MWAS of the RA gut microbiome in the Japanese population (n case=82, n control=42) by using whole-genome shotgun sequencing of high depth (average 13 Gb per sample). Our MWAS consisted of three major bioinformatic analytic pipelines (phylogenetic analysis, functional gene analysis and pathway analysis).

Phylogenetic case–control association tests showed high abundance of multiple species belonging to the genus Prevotella (e.g., Prevotella denticola) in the RA case metagenome. The non-linear machine learning method efficiently deconvoluted the case–control phylogenetic discrepancy. Gene functional assessments showed that the abundance of one redox reaction-related gene (R6FCZ7) was significantly decreased in the RA metagenome compared with controls. A variety of biological pathways including those related to metabolism (e.g., fatty acid biosynthesis and glycosaminoglycan degradation) were enriched in the case–control comparison. A population-specific link between the metagenome and host genome was identified by comparing biological pathway enrichment between the RA metagenome and the RA genome-wide association study results. No apparent discrepancy in alpha or beta diversities of metagenome was found between RA cases and controls.

Our shotgun sequencing-based MWAS highlights a novel link among the gut microbiome, host genome and pathology of RA, which contributes to our understanding of the microbiome’s role in RA aetiology.

The human microbiome, which refers to the microbial communities inhabiting the human body, has remarkable effects on our immune system and metabolism.1 Different microbiome compositions have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiometabolic disorders, inflammatory bowel diseases and cancer.2–5 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prevalent autoimmune disorder characterised by synovial inflammation and joint damage.6 In addition to environmental and genetic factors, the microbiome has emerged as a candidate factor responsible for the onset of RA.7 The microbiomes of various sites within the body such as the gut, oral cavity and lungs have been implicated in RA.8–14 Several mechanisms leading to immune abnormality in RA have been reported (e.g, the production of citrullinated peptides by Porphyromonas gingivalis 15 and the activation of immune responses via Th17 cells by Prevotella copri 13). However, the aetiology of RA linked to the microbiome still remains unknown. Additionally, although ethnicity and dietary habits are major factors leading to differences in microbiome compositions, there have been few population-specific microbiome studies focused on RA in non-European or non-Westernised populations.

Here, we report a comprehensive MWAS of the gut microbiome in an RA case–control cohort of the Japanese population. We carried out whole-genome shotgun sequencing of 124 faecal samples (82 individuals with RA and 42 healthy controls). Our MWAS consisted of three major bioinformatic analytic techniques (phylogenetic analysis, functional gene analysis and pathway analysis), which allowed us to comprehensively grasp case–control disparity in the gut metagenome. We newly introduced an unsupervised ML-based clustering approach to depict the RA metagenome landscape. To evaluate the link between the gut metagenome and the human germline genome, we compared the pathway enrichment of the gut microbiome MWAS and that of the host GWAS in RA.

We performed whole-genome shotgun sequencing of a total of 124 faecal DNA samples (sequencing group 1: 29 samples from 15 individuals with RA and 14 controls; sequencing group 2: 95 samples from 67 individuals with RA and 28 controls; see online supplementary table 1), which passed stringent quality control (QC) for sequence reads and samples (online supplementary figure 1).

After QC, we assigned sequence reads to taxonomic references and quantified phylogenetic relative abundances separately for each taxonomic level (online supplementary figure 2). We selected a total of 803 clades with an average relative abundance of >1.0×10−5 and detected in more than 20% of the samples in both sequencing groups, including 10 phyla (L2), 23 classes (L3), 34 orders (L4), 72 families (L5), 185 genera (L6) and 479 species (L7). Case–control phylogenetic association tests using a generalised linear regression model identified significant associations of the nine clades (empirically estimated false discovery rate (FDR) q<0.05; figure 1A,B, table 1). Notably, all the associated clades increased in RA samples compared with controls. As illustrated in a phylogenetic tree indicating the case–control association results of multilayered taxonomic levels (figure 1C), clades with more specific taxonomic levels (such as genus (L6) or species (L7)) tended to show greater differences in case–control factors (i.e., effect size). Among the nine clades with significant case–control associations, eight clades belonged to species (L7, the most specific level). Because it was difficult to detect these species level clades using classical 16S rRNA sequence analysis, these results clearly demonstrate the value of metagenome shotgun sequencing in identifying disease-associated taxa. We note that our shotgun sequencing study newly identified that the majority of RA-associated clades belonged to the genus Prevotella (P. denticola, P. marshii, P. disiens, P. corporis and P. amnii). While P. copri has been reported to be abundant in the gut microbiome of patients with RA,13 our results revealed that multiple other species in the genus Prevotella are also related to RA aetiology.

We performed ML-based deconvolution of the metagenome data to comprehensively assess the case–control discrepancy at the species level (L7). First, we adopted UMAP, a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique, for deconvolution of the complex taxonomic relative abundance data into two-dimensional data (figure 1D). We subsequently performed unsupervised clustering of the results of UMAP with the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm,23 which classified the species into 14 clusters (online supplementary table 2). Next, we assessed the degree to which each cluster contained species with significant differences in the case–control phylogenetic association tests. One cluster was enriched with species with case–control discrepancies, as shown by hypergeometric tests (p=1.9×10−8, OR=27; figure 1E). Among the eight species which showed q-values <0.05 in the case–control phylogenetic association tests, half belonged to this cluster (n=4). The sum of the species belonging to this cluster also showed a significant difference in the case–control association test (p=0.0057, effect size=0.48). While we parallelly applied classical linear ML methods such as PCA and non-metric multidimensional scaling in the same manner, cluster deconvolution was not clear and no cluster showed a significant case–control discrepancy (online supplementary figure 3). These results indicate that the non-linear ML method could efficiently provide novel knowledge in metagenome analyses.

To evaluate functional aspects of the RA gut metagenome, we performed metagenomic shotgun sequencing according to the following procedures: (1) de novo assembly, (2) prediction of open reading frames (ORFs), (3) clustering and annotation of ORFs, and (4) read mapping to assembled contigs. We selected 179 333 and 211 315 genes annotated by the UniRef9024 and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)25 databases, respectively. Case–control gene association tests using a generalised linear regression model found significant associations for a total of 12 genes (1 and 11 for UniRef90 and KEGG, respectively; empirically estimated FDR: q<0.05; figure 2, table 2). Of these, nine showed increased abundance in RA samples compared with controls. One gene demonstrated a highly significant association that satisfied the empirical Bonferroni’s correlation (p=2.5×10−7, effect size=−1.19, R6FCZ7). R6FCZ7 is registered as a FeS assembly sulphur utilisation factor system protein in the UniRef database; it has not yet been given an official gene name by nomenclature committees. This kind of protein performs a wide range of bacterial functions, such as electron transfer, redox catalysis and gene regulation.26 Several previous studies have reported that reactive oxygen species play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA,27 and Zhang et al. 8 also reported alteration of the redox environment in the RA gut microbiome. In taxonomic assignment, the source strain of R6FCZ7 was registered as Bacteroides sp. CAG:633. In our metagenome data, the R6FCZ7 sequences were further linked to the taxonomic reference genomes of Bacteroides uniformis, B. rodentium and B. fragilis, as well as Bacteroides sp. This implies that several species belonging to the genus Bacteroides functionally possess this gene. Overall, our results suggest that the redox function of the microbiome, especially the genus Bacteroides, may have an important role in the pathology of RA.

Using the results of the gene analysis part of our MWAS, we performed gene set enrichment analysis to conduct case–control pathway association tests. We found significant associations for 19 Gene Ontology (GO) terms that satisfied the empirical Bonferroni’s correlation (figure 3A, table 3). One of the significant GO terms was metal ion binding (p=2.0×10−5, GO:0046872), which implies that the interaction between reactive oxygen species and metal ions is associated with the pathology of RA, which is similar to the result of the gene association tests. The eight KEGG pathways showed significant associations (q<0.05; figure 3B). A part of the substances related to these pathways are involved in the pathophysiology of RA as follows: (1) Fatty acids have been found to be related to inflammation and several free fatty acids in serum are reported to be upregulated in patients with RA.28 (2) Terpenoids suppress nuclear factor-kB signalling, the major regulator in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.29 They are the main component of Tripterygium wilfordii, a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine which has been shown to be non-inferior to methotrexate in the treatment of RA.30 (3) Adipocytokines have been reported to contribute to the proinflammatory state of RA, increasing in the synovial fluid of patients with RA.31 (4) Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are major components of joint cartilage and other soft connective tissues. Modification of GAG metabolism may play a crucial role in RA pathogenesis.32 These results suggest that the aforementioned substances in the gut could influence the pathology of RA. The system diagram of the KEGG pathways with the results of the case–control pathway association tests clearly illustrates that a variety of pathways, including those related to metabolism, showed significant case–control differences (figure 3C).

We assessed whether biological pathways of the gut metagenome and the host germline genome were shared in RA. In addition to our KEGG pathway enrichment of the RA gut metagenome of the Japanese population, we estimated pathway enrichment in the host genome of RA samples, using previously conducted RA GWAS data in East Asian and European populations (n=22 515 and n=58 284, respectively).18 We note that the majority of subjects in the East Asian RA GWAS were of Japanese ancestry (93.1%). We compared the p values of the KEGG pathways shared between the RA MWAS data (Japanese) and the RA GWAS data (separately for East Asians and Europeans; figure 3D). Several pathways showed significant enrichment between the metagenomes and host genomes (p<0.05 in both; e.g., FoxO signalling pathway, Th17 cell differentiation and interleukin-17 signalling pathway). We observed a significant correlation between pathway p values in East Asians (p Fisher=0.045), but not in Europeans (p Fisher=0.41). Considering that MWAS–GWAS pathway correlation was specifically observed when the metagenome and the host genome data in similar populations were compared, there should be a population-specific link between the germline genome and metagenome in RA pathology.

The microbial diversity of the RA gut microbiome is still controversial. We thus evaluated alpha and beta diversity in the phylogenetic data (phylogenetic relative abundance of six levels (L2–L7)) and functional data (gene abundance based on UniRef90 protein and KEGG gene databases). No significant difference was found in any case–control comparisons of alpha diversity based on the Shannon index (p>0.05; figure 4A and B). As for beta diversity, no level of phylogenetic data showed significant case–control differences in either sequencing group (p>0.05; figure 4C). The gene abundance data also did not show significant differences (p>0.05; only UniRef90 data shown in figure 4D). Overall, there was no apparent discrepancy in metagenome diversity between RA cases and controls.

Whole-genome shotgun sequencing of the metagenome has been increasing in importance as more attention is paid to the association between diseases and microbiomes. In our study, we conducted a comprehensive MWAS by using whole-genome shotgun sequencing. We found that the RA gut metagenome of the studied Japanese population has the following interesting characteristics: (1) Multiple species belonging to the Prevotella genus increased in the RA gut metagenome. (2) Non-linear ML methods such as UMAP could be used to successfully deconvolute case–control phylogenetic discrepancies. (3) The abundance of one gene related to redox reaction was decreased in the RA metagenome. (4) Various biological pathways, including those related to metabolism, were enriched in a case–control comparison. (5) A population-specific pathway link between the metagenome (MWAS) and the host genome (GWAS) was identified. (6) No apparent discrepancy in microbial diversity was found between RA cases and controls. Our study greatly exploited the benefits of shotgun sequencing, since it would be challenging to obtain such novel findings using the classical method of 16S rRNA.

In conclusion, our shotgun sequencing-based comprehensive MWAS in the Japanese RA population revealed a novel link between the gut microbiome, host genome and pathology of RA. In addition to providing novel insights into the RA gut microbiome, our study will provide useful resources for future functional investigations to further elucidate details of the microbiome’s role in RA aetiology.
