Response of the human gut and saliva microbiome to urbanization in Cameroon

Urban populations from highly industrialized countries are characterized by a lower gut bacterial diversity as well as by changes in composition compared to rural populations from less industrialized countries. To unveil the mechanisms and factors leading to this diversity loss, it is necessary to identify the factors associated with urbanization-induced shifts at a smaller geographical scale, especially in less industrialized countries. To do so, we investigated potential associations between a variety of dietary, medical, parasitological and socio-cultural factors and the gut and saliva microbiomes of 147 individuals from three populations along an urbanization gradient in Cameroon. We found that the presence of Entamoeba sp., a commensal gut protozoan, followed by stool consistency, were major determinants of the gut microbiome diversity and composition. Interestingly, urban individuals have retained most of their gut eukaryotic and bacterial diversity despite significant changes in diet compared to the rural areas, suggesting that the loss of bacterial microbiome diversity observed in industrialized areas is likely associated with medication. Finally, we observed a weak positive correlation between the gut and the saliva microbiome diversity and composition, even though the saliva microbiome is mainly shaped by habitat-related factors.

Humans living in urban areas from highly industrialized countries host less diverse gut microbiomes than those in rural areas from the less industrialized ones. This effect of industrialization (as we refer to it hereafter) has been reported by numerous studies comparing urban areas in Europe or North America with rural ones in Africa, Asia or South America1–8. Loss in alpha diversity is further accompanied by systematic shifts in bacterial composition (see e.g.9,10). Despite crucial implications for human health11,12, the factors responsible for these ecological changes are still unclear. Two main (non-exclusive) hypotheses have been proposed: (i) decreased consumption of dietary fibers13,14 and (ii) improved sanitation and access to medical care (including antibiotics15). In addition, geographical latitude could be a confounding factor, given that it is a proxy for the diversity of environmental bacteria16. Indeed, the only two studies that did not find a loss of diversity with industrialization were studies considering rural populations not living in a warm tropical environment17,18.

To examine the effect of urbanization on the gut and saliva microbiomes and to identify the factors associated with their variation in a less industrialized setting, we collected fecal and saliva samples of 147 individuals along an urbanization gradient in Cameroon (rural, semi-urban and urban populations, Fig. 1A). We further collected dietary, medical, parasitological and other socio-cultural information for each individual (Supplementary Table 1). We first described the urbanization gradient by identifying the factors that significantly varied across populations, and then we investigated changes in the gut and saliva microbiome diversity and composition based on the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data. We examined different aspects of diversity by calculating several indices and assessed the effect of OTU clustering level in order to explore multiple, potentially ecologically informative aspects of the data. This study is one of the first to collect a large number of variables describing biological and cultural variation (including diet, medical practices and other socio-economic factors) and to test them for association with diversity and composition of the human microbiome in a country with a minimum level of industrialization.

In order to get a comprehensive overview of the biological and cultural factors associated with the sampled urbanization gradient (represented by a rural, a semi-urban and an urban population), we performed a multivariate ordination analysis for non-dietary information, dietary 24h-recall (quantifying the nutrients and energy intake in the last 24 hours) and dietary FFQ data (Food Frequency Questionnaire, assessing the average consumption of selected food categories over time) separately.

Overall, the studied urbanization gradient can be mainly described in terms of habitat-related factors (such as sanitary conditions), education level and number of children, as well as by differences in diet, particularly in the amount of processed food, meat and fibers. On the other hand, the prevalence of gut eukaryotes and medical practices seem to be mostly independent of the urbanization level.

To examine different aspects of non-phylogenetic and phylogenetic alpha diversity, we calculated weighted and non-weighted effective numbers of species or lineages (Table 1). None of the non-phylogenetic diversity measures (0D, 1D, 2D or InfD) nor the phylogenetic lineage richness (0Dph) changed along the urbanization gradient (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2). Conversely, dominant lineage diversity (2Dph) decreased by 6% with urbanization level in both the gut and the saliva microbiome. For the saliva microbiome, we also found a 10% decrease in common lineage diversity (1Dph) with increasing urbanization.

As the dietary FFQ data were only available for the rural and urban samples, we performed additional analyses excluding the semi-urban samples, both with and without the dietary FFQ data. These analyses overall confirmed the above trends despite some minor differences (Supplementary Table 3, Fig. 4).

For the saliva microbiome, only the models predicting 2Dph (complete dataset) and 1Dph (rural-urban subsets) had R-squared values >= 0.1 and were thus considered for interpretation (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 3, Fig. 4). The strongest predictors of 2Dph in all three data subsets were urbanization level and access to electricity. In the rural-urban datasets, 1Dph and 2Dph were additionally predicted by water source and the type of floor in the house (Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 1). As both of these variables and access to electricity were strongly correlated with urbanization in pairwise comparisons (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 4), the observed decrease in saliva microbiome phylogenetic diversity (1Dph and 2Dph) with urbanization (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2) might be linked to the differences in habitat-related factors.

We aimed both to detect the taxa whose relative abundances changed along the urbanization gradient and to identify the biological and cultural factors that best explain the variability of the gut microbiome. To accomplish the first goal, we analyzed the community composition with ALDEx2 (a tool for the differential abundance analysis of compositional data) and found changes in the relative abundance of 41/282 tested ASVs (Amplicon Sequence Variants) along the urbanization gradient (Supplementary Table 5). Whereas the relative abundance of some genera either consistently decreased (e.g. Succinivibrio, Faecalibacterium, Prevotella, Roseburia, Coprococcus) or increased (e.g. Allistipes, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Butyricicoccus) with increasing urbanization, various unclassified Lachnospiraceae ASVs responded differently to urbanization. In order to identify phylogenetic lineages that are most consistently affected by urbanization regardless of the phylogenetic and taxonomic scale, we performed phylofactorization. The majority of phylofactors were composed of a single ASV, indicating that urbanization-related changes occurred primarily at a fine phylogenetic scale (Supplementary Table 6). Interestingly, 16 phylofactors were composed of one or more Prevotella ASVs that all had consistently higher abundance in rural samples, suggesting that different strains disappear at different rates in response to urbanization. Detailed phylofactorization results can be found in Supplementary Table 6, Fig. 5 and Supplementary results.

Finally, we identified four enterotypes (gut community types),: F1, strongly dominated by Prevotella; F2, enriched in Ruminococcaceae, unclassified Clostridiales, Lachnospiraceae and another unclassified bacterial genus; F3, which could be considered as a transient type between the first two; and F4, dominated by Bacteroides and Lachnospiraceae (Supplementary Fig. 7). These were differentially distributed between the studied populations, with 74% of rural individuals characterized by enterotypes F1 and F3, 74% of semi-urban individuals by enterotypes F1 and F2, and 59% of urban individuals by the enterotype F2 (Fisher’s exact test < 0.05). A more detailed description and the analysis of enterotypes can be found in the Supplementary results and Supplementary Fig. 8.

Regarding the saliva microbiome, the relative abundance of only eight out of 110 ASVs tested by ALDex2 significantly changed along the urbanization gradient (Supplementary Table 5). Specifically, urbanization was accompanied by an increase in the relative abundance of three ASVs from the genera Veillonella, Rothia, Streptococcus and Actinomyces and a decrease in the relative abundance of two ASVs assigned to Fusobacterium and unclassifed Pasteurellaceae. Phylofactorization identified 26 edges as significantly differentiating between the three populations, with nine phylofactors composed of more than one ASV (Supplementary Table 6, observed and predicted changes in relative abundances associated with the first six phylofactors can be found in Supplementary Fig. 5).

Saliva microbial communities in the studied populations could be grouped into two types (stomatotypes): S1, dominated by Prevotella and Streptococcus and S2, enriched in Enterobacteriaceae. The urban population, with 84% of individuals hosting the S1 stomatotype, significantly differed from the semi-urban and rural population, where both stomatotypes were equally represented (Fisher’s exact test, rural - urban: p = 0.005, semi-urban - urban: p = 0.054, Supplementary Fig. 7). More details can be found in Supplementary results.

To examine the relationship between the gut and saliva microbiome, we first calculated Pearson correlations between the alpha diversity values within each individual. We found weak positive correlations between the species and lineage richness (0D and 0Dph) as well as InfD of the gut and saliva microbiome (Pearson r = 0.23 and r = 0.22, respectively, Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. 9). We then asked if the gut and saliva microbiome of an individual shared more species than a random gut-saliva microbiome pair. This was indeed the case (Supplementary Fig. 10, standardized effect = −0.30, p = 0.003,), but the effect became only marginally significant when permutations were restricted to within urbanization levels (standardized effect size = −0.14, p = 0.052). Subsequently, we checked if the similarity between the gut and saliva microbiome varied across the urbanization levels. We found that the gut and saliva microbiomes of rural individuals shared slightly less ASVs than the microbiomes of semi-urban and urban individuals (Fig. 6, F2, 92 = 19.95, p < 10−8, 0.98% decrease). Conversely, we found no significant influence of the urbanization level on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between the saliva and gut microbiome, despite a decreasing trend (F2,92 = 2.96, p = 0.056). Additional analyses exploring the effect of OTU clustering on the conclusions of the study can be found in the Supplementary Figs. 11–13 and Supplementary results.

By using detailed biological and cultural characterization of the populations under study, we show that the presence of a commensal gut eukaryote Entamoeba sp. is the strongest determinant of gut microbiome diversity and composition in a minimally industrialized country. Gut protozoa thus appear as an important factor to consider when studying the ecology and evolution of the gut ecosystem. As the studied populations did not differ in either Entamoeba sp. prevalence, gut microbiome richness or medical practices (despite the differences in diet), we propose that the loss of microbiome diversity in highly industrialized countries might be partially explained either by (i) the loss of gut eukaryotes or (ii) differences in medication.

In conclusion, urbanization was associated with minor shifts in diversity of the gut and saliva microbiome, but also with changes in the gut microbiome composition that were reminiscent of those associated with industrialization. Although some of the important factors shaping the gut microbiome, such as stool consistency and diet, are the same as in industrialized populations, gut eukaryotes (Entamoeba sp.) represent the major determinant of diversity and composition here. This may be one of the main confounders when comparing industrialized (virtually gut-eukaryote free) and non-industrialized populations. In order to advance our understanding of how industrialization affects the human microbiome, we need to account for these confounders, for example by routinely collecting more cultural data as well as by including parasitological information. Luckily, microscopic analyses of the fecal samples are not necessary if metagenomics data is collected, as parasitological screening can be performed from genomic data26.

The research permits, including the appropriate ethic approvals, were obtained for this study from the CNERSH (Comité national d’Ethique de la Recherche pour la Santé Humaine) in Cameroon (Approval N°2017/05/900), as well as from regional health districts (Centre region, Approval N°0061). We further obtained an ethical approval from the French CPP (Comité de Protection des Personnes, approval N°2016-sept-14344), as well as the authorization to import and store these samples from the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research (N°IE-2016-876 and DC-2016-2740, respectively). Finally, we obtained the authorization to store personal data in France from the CNIL (Commission Nationale Informatique et Libertés, N°1972648). We obtained the informed consent of each participant for contributing to this research and publishing the associated-data. Consent for publication is not applicable. All research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.

We sampled 147 adult volunteers at three locations in Cameroon (Fig. 1A), representing an urbanization gradient: 81 individuals in Ngoantet (rural), 34 in Mbalmayo (semi-urban) and 32 in Yaoundé (urban), after obtaining their informed consent. The participants declared being currently healthy, i.e. not taking medication for any infectious or metabolic disease or suffering from specific symptoms (e.g. fever). They were between 18 and 65 years old and were not related at the second degree. They self-collected the feces during the morning in sterile recipients provided by us (Medline stool containers). We then placed app. 3 g of the fecal samples into 60 mL containers with RNAlater. For saliva, the participants spit 2 mL of saliva into a 15 mL falcon tube, to which we added the same volume of a homemade buffer (5 mM TRIS, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM sucrose, 10 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, pH = 8).

Anthropometric traits (height and weight) were measured using standardized techniques. The Centre Pasteur du Cameroun furthermore performed a microscopic analysis of the fecal samples to identify the gut eukaryotes (with a bias toward the identification of potentially pathogenic species, i.e., worms and Entamoeba sp.). For Entamoeba sp., we grouped individuals in categories depending on the output of the microscopic analysis as follows: “0_ none” if no cyst nor any trophozoites was seen; “1_rare” if only rare cysts were observed; “2_some” if only few cysts or few trophozoites were observed; “3_abundant” if numerous cysts and/or trophozoites were observed. Finally, we estimated the Bristol stool scale score by visually assessing the stool consistency (a proxy for colonic transit time and water content51).

App. 250 mg of fecal material was disrupted by bead-beating and DNA was subsequently extracted with the MOBIO PowerFecal DNA isolation kit (MOBIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA from the saliva samples was extracted following the protocol of Quinque et al.52. The extracted DNA was quantified with NanoDrop (ThermoScientific). Sequencing libraries targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene were prepared by the MOC core facility at the Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA and sequenced as 150 bp paired-end reads in two runs on an Illumina MiSeq. 300 (as described in53), resulting in an average of 61,617 ± 43,997 (st. dev.) raw reads per sample (Supplementary Table 9).

All analyses were performed in R54 except for the parts of sequencing data preprocessing that was done in mothur55.

We imputed missing values in the contextual data using the missForest R package56. In order to assess the strength of pairwise correlations between the variables, we calculated Pearson’s r for pairs of numerical variables, Cramer’s V for categorical predictors (using the rcompanion package57 and omega for numerical-categorical combinations. We disregarded all correlation coefficients for which the t-test, chi-square test or Kruskal-Wallis test (for numerical, categorical and numerical-categorical variables, respectively) were not significant at alpha = 0.05. In addition to the urbanization level variable, we analyzed 51 variables collected in all three populations: 28 dietary variables from a 24h-recall questionnaire and 23 non-dietary variables. We analyzed 49 additional dietary FFQ variables for the urban and rural populations only. The presence of Entamoeba sp. and smoking habits were encoded both as binary, as well as ordered factors (specifying Entamoeba sp. load and smoking intensity and duration), which resulted in a total of 25 non-dietary variables tested for correlations. After correcting for multiple testing, 403 out of 1431 (28%) and 555 out of 5253 (11%) pairwise correlations between these variables were significant in the complete and rural-urban dataset, respectively (alpha = 0.05, Supplementary Table 4). Strong correlations (abs(Pearson) >= 0.8, Cramer’s V or Omega >= 0.4) were mainly found between 24h-recall dietary variables and between habitat-related (e.g. sanitary) variables (Supplementary Fig. 1). In addition, the urbanization level was associated with some habitat-related variables, including water source, access to electricity, type of floor and presence of animals in the house. The inclusion of the dietary FFQ data (and omission of semi-urban samples) revealed some additional correlations, notably between the urbanization level (or some of the associated habitat-related variables) and: education level, number of children and consumption of meat, cassava and peanuts.

In order to explore the multivariate aspects of the contextual data and to identify the factors that best describe the urbanization gradient, we used the FactoMineR package58. We first performed a factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD) with all non-dietary variables. The categorical variables representing the ordered factors were duplicated and one version was coded as a numerical while the other was coded as a categorical variable. We performed a separate PCA on 24h-recall dietary data normalized by total energy input, as well as on the FFQ data for the rural-urban data subset only. In each case, the correlation coefficient between the ordination axes and urbanization level were calculated with dimdesc in order to statistically test the representation of the urbanization gradient by the axes. In addition, we tested the association between FFQ data and urbanization level with the v test from the same package (function “catdes”).

Sequences were denoised using dada259 according to the authors’ recommendations. First, the reads were processed with the filterAndTrim command in order to remove phiX spike-in and reads with ambiguous bases, to truncate reads at the first base with quality score <= 2 and to filter reads with more than 2 expected errors. The sequences were then dereplicated with the derepFastq function. Subsequently, the error rate was estimated from a subset of 1,000,000 reads for each run separately using the learnErrors function. These error rate estimates were used in the actual denoising function, dada, run with the option pool = T. The denoised forward and reverse reads were merged with mergePairs command in order to obtain amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Finally, we created input files for further processing in mothur55: a fasta file and a group file (assigning sequences to samples). In summary, 83% (12 800 410/15 398 557) of raw reads passed quality control and denoising steps (Supplementary Table 9). We removed 11 out of 250 samples due to low number of reads (<1500). The remaining 239 (141 fecal and 98 saliva) samples contained on average 53 540 reads (±34 540).

The number of reads and ASVs per sample before and after quality control are reported in Supplementary Table 9. The number of reads and OTUs before and after filtering for each combination of clustering method and cutoff are listed in Supplementary Table 10. We identified in total 4,078 ASVs (grouped into 246 genera), 2,977 of which were found in the fecal microbiome (209 genera) and 2,025 in the saliva microbiome (198 genera).

The phylogenetic tree was created with RaxML67 following the protocol described in Stamatakis68. We imposed the monophyly of the classes within Proteobacteria on the tree topology as described in Groussin et al.66. We ran 100 independent fast tree searches with GTRGAMMA model, performed a bootstrap analysis (with autoMRE option, which automatically determines how many replicates are needed to get stable support values, in this case 550 trees) on the best tree and created a MR consensus tree. All independent trees were unique and the tree diversity was high (average Robinson-Foulds topology distance = 0.5029), indicating an unstable topology. This was further supported by low relative tree certainty from the bootstrap analysis (0.150089). Still, the best tree was significantly better than the suboptimal ones according to the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test69. Although the results of phylofactorization differed somewhat depending on the tree (not shown), they were overall congruent, so we used the best tree in all analyses (phylogenetic diversity, bdtt OTU clustering and phylofactorization).

We calculated rarefactions curves for Good’s coverage and non-phylogenetic alpha diversity indices (observed species, Shannon’S H, inverse Simpson and Berger-Parker dominance) with 1000 iterations at 1000 sequence steps in mothur55. Based on the rarefaction results (not shown), we chose a subsampling depth of 6500 reads per sample for calculating the average (200 replicates) of the above alpha diversity indices. We then transformed these values into the effective number of species as described in Jost70. Effective number of species is the number of species in a perfectly even community that results in a given value of a diversity index. Diversity indices within this framework are mathematically defined as Hill numbers of different order (q) and can be linked to the more traditionally used richness and dominance/evenness indices. The order, q, defines how much weight is given to the abundant species: q = 0 ignores the abundance altogether (and is equal to species richness), q = 1 weighs the species exactly according to their abundance (and corresponds to exp(Shannon’s H)), q = 2 is the same as inverse Simpson index and gives emphasis to dominant species, whereas q = Inf corresponds to the inverse of Berger-Parker dominance, and thus depends only on the relative abundance of the most abundant species. The advantage of these indices is that they are intuitive and easily interpretable: they have common units and possess doubling property (i.e. diversity of a union of two communities with completely distinct species is the sum of diversities of the two component communities). Jost70 refers to these diversity indices as “diversity of order 0, 1, 2”. We use here their mathematical denotations - 0D, 1D, 2D and InfD - for brevity.

Chao et al.71 developed a corresponding Hill-number framework for phylogenetic diversity. The main idea is the same, but here the diversity is defined as effective number of lineages, corresponding to the phylogenetic diversity of a perfectly even community composed of perfectly distinct species. We used the hillR R package72 to calculate average phylogenetic diversity indices of order 0, 1 and 2 of 20 dataset replicates subsampled to 6500 reads/sample. We refer to these indices as 0Dph, 1Dph, 2Dph..

In order to get rid of the noise and to reduce the complexity of the dataset, we performed a two-step unsupervised filtering implemented in the PERFect package73. Briefly, the method compares the total covariance of the community data (“OTU table”) before and after removal of a taxon. This “difference in filtering loss” is then compared with a null distribution and the taxon is retained or discarded for a given significance level alpha (here alpha = 0.1). Based on the empirical evidence and authors’ suggestions, we assumed that at least 50% of taxa were not informative and therefore fitted a skew-normal distribution to the observed filtering loss values. In the first step, called simultaneous filtering, the taxa are ordered according to the number of occurrences and filtered sequentially as long as the filtering loss values come from the null distribution; in the second step, called permutation filtering, the taxa are ordered according to the p-values from the first step and filtered based on an additional permutation step (1000 replicates) that ensures that only the taxa that are uninformative for any combination of retained taxa are removed. We filtered the gut and saliva microbiome datasets separately. Filtering for beta diversity analyses resulted in 282 ASVs for the fecal and 110 ASVs for the saliva dataset (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). This filtering step reduced the number of reads by 31% and 9% in the fecal and saliva datasets respectively, while eliminating on average 90% and 88% of the ASVs/OTUs/genera, regardless of the clustering method and cutoff.

For distance-based analyses, we performed a centered log ratio (clr) transformation75 implemented in the CoDaSeq R package76,77 and calculated the Euclidean distances, corresponding to Aitchison distances of raw compositional data78. For community type determination, we grouped the non-filtered ASV dataset at the genus level with the phyloseq “tax_glom” command79.

To examine how the human microbiome diversity changes along the urbanization gradient, we analyzed the gut and saliva microbiome separately.

Finally, in order to identify the lineages that most predictably vary along the urbanization gradient regardless of the classification level, we performed a phylofactorization using the phylofactor package83, with a custom objective function (the same gls model as used in the alpha diversity analysis), F-statistic as a criterion for choosing the best edge, and KS test as the stopping function.

In order to classify the microbiomes into the optimal number of categories, we performed Dirichlet-multinomial mixture (DMM) modelling84 on the genus-level data with the DirichletMultinomial package85. We chose the optimal number of components based on the Laplace goodness-of-fit of models with one to ten components. We calculated associations between enterotypes (gut community types86) and stomatotypes (saliva community types46), as well as between the community types and urbanization using Fisher’s exact test as in44.

As food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data were not available for semi-urban samples, we performed each of the following analyses three times: for all samples without FFQ data, and for rural-urban samples with and without FFQ data.

We analyzed potential associations between the community composition and the metadata by a distance-based approach inspired by Gloor et al.90 and Falony et al.25. Briefly, we performed a Principal Component Analysis on the equivalents of Aitchison distances with the package vegan91. We found the variables significantly associated with the first three axes of variation using the envfit function. If some of the significant variables were correlated (correlation coefficient >= 0.8, Supplementary Table 3), we selected the one that explained more variation in envfit and discarded the rest. We then used these selected variables as a scope for ordistep (bidirectional) variable selection. Finally, we identified the ASVs (or OTUs) whose coordinates were in the lower 2.5% and the upper 97.5% quantile on the first three PCA axes as well as those with the distances in the 2.5% and the upper 97.5% quantile from the coordinates of the selected environmental variables (calculated with the cdist function from the rdist package92.

We investigated a potential correlation between the gut and saliva microbiome diversity within individual using Pearson’s r coefficient, with nonparametric bootstrap 95% confidence intervals calculated with the boot package93,94. In order to determine if the gut and saliva microbiome within an individual share more species than expected by chance, we compared the observed within-individual beta diversity values (both Bray-Curtis and species turnover measure that accounts for the differences in species richness between the samples; the measure varies between 1 for identical communities and 2 for completely distinct communities95) with the null distribution created by shuffling the sample labels 10 000 times. We either used free permutations or allowed permutations only within the population, to account for the differences between them. We calculated the p-values as observed rank/10 001 and the standardized effect size as (observed mean - random mean)/random standard deviation.
