Microbiomes other than the gut: inflammaging and age-related diseases

During the course of evolution, bacteria have developed an intimate relationship with humans colonizing specific body sites at the interface with the body exterior and invaginations such as nose, mouth, lung, gut, vagina, genito-urinary tract, and skin and thus constituting an integrated meta-organism. The final result has been a mutual adaptation and functional integration which confers significant advantages to humans and bacteria. The immune system of the host co-evolved with the microbiota to develop complex mechanisms to recognize and destroy invading microbes, while preserving its own bacteria. Composition and diversity of the microbiota change according to development and aging and contribute to humans’ health and fitness by modulating the immune system response and inflammaging and vice versa. In the last decades, we experienced an explosion of studies on the role of gut microbiota in aging, age-related diseases, and longevity; however, less reports are present on the role of the microbiota at different body sites. In this review, we describe the key steps of the co-evolution between Homo sapiens and microbiome and how this adaptation can impact on immunosenescence and inflammaging. We briefly summarized the role of gut microbiota in aging and longevity while bringing out the involvement of the other microbiota.

The lifelong adaptation of the body to the insult from bacterial/viral infections and other stressors represents the origin of a profound age-related remodeling of the immune system (IS) known as “immunosenescence” [1–6] that supports the chronic low-grade inflammatory status called “inflammaging” [6–9]. Even though both immunosenescence and inflammaging (representing two sides of the same coin) may contribute to a higher susceptibility to age-related diseases, several studies demonstrated that they are also necessary to extend survival/longevity [10]. The phenotype of old people and centenarians is indeed surprisingly complex and very dynamic and is the consequence of the ability of the body to respond/adapt to the detrimental stimuli we are exposed to throughout our lifetime [9]. This phenomenon has been conceptualized as “remodeling,” which can be considered a general theory of aging [1, 7]. Centenarians are characterized by high levels of anti-inflammatory molecules [11–14] in the attempt to counteract the increase of inflammaging and find an optimal balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, which likely allowed them to reach the extreme limit of human lifespan [15]. This remodeling is shaped by the immunological history of the organism, a concept dubbed “immunobiography” [16]. According to this idea, everyone has a peculiar immunobiography and consequently a personal inflammaging/immunosenescence. In this scenario longevity, aging and age-related diseases represent a continuum without precise boundaries with the extremes represented by diseases on one side and by centenarians, the best example of successful aging, on the opposite side [17].

The present review not only will discuss the co-evolution of microbes and humans and summarize the main findings regarding the gut microbiota (GM) in aging and age-related disease as well as in longevity, but will also focus on the role of many other microbial sites in the human body which are less studied than those in the gut but have a role in healthy and unhealthy aging.

Bacteria are older than humans; they were already present on the Earth when eukaryotic cells arose about 2.2 billion years ago. Together with archea, fungi, protists, helminths, and viruses, some bacteria became host-associated and started a long history of co-evolution [21]. Due to symbiotic relationship with the various microbial communities, collectively called “microbiota” present in various anatomical locations of the body, humans have to be considered as a metaorganisms (also termed superorganisms or holobionts) [22]. Trillions of individual bacterial cells colonize the mouth, upper airways, skin, vagina, genito-urinary, and intestinal tract representing a highly integrated ecosystem, which undergoes dynamic changes through time to adapt and respond to environmental signals. The intimate relationships between humans and bacteria have molded the phenotypes in our ancestral lineages. Evidence shows that there is an overlap of the phylogenetic trees of the bacterial microbiota and of primates [23] demonstrating the host-microbiota co-evolution, also genetic [24], and the transmission of microbes within the species through the generations [25].

The microbiota associated with the intestinal tract (the GM) is currently the most studied. Microbes in the gut are fundamental for the metabolism of complex vegetal polysaccharides, the biosynthesis of vitamins, and the modulation of fat storage and increase our capacity to extract energy from food [30, 31]; moreover, they are able to strongly control innate and specific immunity. Recent studies on germ-free and gnotobiotic mice revealed that the intense and dynamic crosstalk with the intestinal microbiota strongly impacts the development, education, and homeostasis of the intestinal IS [34]. The GM is associated with various disorders in humans. Alterations in composition, diversity, and metabolites derived from the GM are connected with impairments of different organs of the human body such as brain, lung, joint, heart, liver, and adipose tissue [35]. Evidence for a causative role of the gut bacteria is strongest in metabolic disease [35]. Many independent studies described the microbiome changes as a function of age [36–38], and our research group has shown that centenarians have their peculiar GM [39, 40]. Given that an alteration in GM composition has been linked to different diseases including those age related, the study of GM composition in aging and longevity underwent an explosion in the last decades.

The GM undergoes both compositional and functional changes along with physiological modifications that characterize the advancement of age [38]. Such changes, documented by studies performed on populations of different geographic origin, can be summarized in (i) a progressive decrease in butyrate-producing, anti-inflammatory bacterial genera such as Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, (ii) a decrease in biodiversity, and (iii) an increase in the proportion of otherwise low-abundant and potentially harmful bacteria (i.e., pathobionts), such as members of the families Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Staphylococcaceae [41–43]. It has been proposed that the increase of pathobionts can be promoted by the low-grade inflammatory status at the level of the intestinal mucosa, which is part of the general process of inflammaging that accompanies the age advancement [44, 45]. Indeed, inflammation is well known to foster the bloom of pathobionts [46] that, in turn, sustain the inflammation by overtaking mutualistic symbionts able to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in particular butyrate [47]. SCFA producers play a crucial role in the human gut by promoting immune homeostasis and counteracting inflammation [48]; thus, their progressive decrease can consolidate and nurture inflammatory processes, generating a sort of self-sustaining loop between inflammaging and GM age-related changes. The altered biodiversity often observed in elderly people could contribute to this process by failing to offer an alternative metabolic pathway for SCFA production. In fact, a healthy adult-like microbiota is characterized by a high functional redundancy, sustained by high level of phylogenetic biodiversity, that cope with compositional changes that can occur in response to environmental events [49]. This feature is more likely to lack in the gut ecosystem of elderly people, resulting in insufficient adaptation to environmental and dietary changes and, possibly, diminished ability to produce important metabolites.

Aging comorbidities, such as frailty, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, as well as cancer, can enhance the age-related changes in GM that, in turn, can promote their consolidation or speed up their progression [45, 52–54]. For instance, immunosenescence can result in inappropriate response towards symbiotic microbiota components and/or decreased capability to control pathogen invasion, contributing to chronic inflammation and, on the long term, to the onset of some cancer types, i.e., colorectal cancer [55, 56]. The decrease of biodiversity could also represent a weakening factor for the host defenses against pathogen invasion, for instance promoting the onset of infections by opportunistic bacteria such as Clostridium difficile. C. difficile-associated diarrhea is a major nosocomial complication for frequently hospitalized elderly [57]. Finally, very recently, a field of particular interest for microbiome and aging research is the possible association between inflammatory and debilitating diseases such as physical frailty, sarcopenia, and osteoarthritis [58] with GM. Even if a direct and causal link between microbes and these frequent age-related conditions has yet to be explored, available data on adults provide muscle mass and function as well as bone and joint [58–61] that could become of importance in future intervention strategies, including diet, supplements, and probiotics/prebiotics, to increase the chances to achieve a “healthy aging” [61, 62].

The ecosystem of the human gut is the most studied microbiome because of its pervasive role due to its capacity to convert environmental signals and dietary nutrients in bioactive compounds which signal to distant organs and tissues in the body. Gut bacteria are thus able to connect to the immune and hormone system, to host metabolism, to the central nervous system as well as other functions of the host [35, 63].

Although relatively few studies are present on the role of the different microbiomes in aging and pathologies, the following sections will describe the main findings regarding the aging of the microbiome of other human ecological niches such as oral cavity, lung, skin, vagina, and genito-urinary tract and the development of clinical diseases that are common among older adults such as pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), urinary tract infection, reactive airways disease, and other malignancies.

The microbiota of the oral cavity is extremely diverse containing as many as 700 or more species [65–68], of which the vast majority belong to the phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria [68–70], and Spirochaetes [68]. Bacterial colonization in the oral cavity and oropharynx occurs mainly on the lips, teeth, cheeks, subgingival and supragingival surfaces, hard and soft palate, and tonsils [68]. The Human Microbiome Project sampled many of these locations and found that, in most, the dominant genera were Streptococcus, followed by Haemophilus, Actinomyces, and Prevotella in the buccal mucosa (cheek), supragingival, and subgingival plaque, respectively [66]. It is thought that there is a “core microbiome” present in the majority of individuals which consists of Actinomyces, Atopobium, Corynebacterium, Rothia, Bergeyella, Capnocytophaga, Prevotella, Granulicatella, Streptococcus, Veillonella, Campylobacter, Cardiobacterium, Haemophilus, Neisseria, TM7, and Fusobacteria [68]. Compared with the gut, the relationship between the oral microbiome and aging is not as well studied [65]. Ogawa et al. analyzed the oral microbiome of elderly individuals living in a nursing home (EN) and those that live independently (control) and found the EN group was less diverse at the phyla level but not at the genus level. The EN group had a higher relative abundance of Actinomyces, Streptococcus, Bacilli, Selenomonas, Veillonella, Haemophilus, and a lower relative abundance of Prevotella, Leptotrichia, Campylobacter, and Fusobacterium compared with the controls [71]. Furthermore, Singh et al. analyzed oral microbiomes of healthy aging (HA) and non-healthy aging (NHA) individuals and found that HA had a higher alpha diversity than NHA. The only genus that was more abundant in HA of the overall most abundant genera was Neisseria. Haemophilus, Fusobacterium, and Capnocytophaga were all increased in HA, but were lower abundance genera. [72].

While much is known about the nasal microbiome early in life, there is less research over the nasal microbiome in elderly individuals. Bomar et al. stated that one study found in elderly individuals the nasal microbiota has a high abundance of Streptococcus, and a study analyzing the nasal microbiota of elderly individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) found that in both PD and healthy controls, the composition of the nasal microbiota resembled that of the middle-aged adult. An additional study analyzing the nasal microbiota of elderly individuals found no difference in diversity between those living in a nursing home and those living independently. However, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus reuteri, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Rothia mucilaginosa were increased in individuals residing in the nursing home [76]. Koskinen et al. examined the relationship between the nasal microbiota and olfactory function. They found that Faecalibacterium and Porphyromonas strongly correlated with a reduction of olfactory function, and Corynebacterium members correlated with a reduction in odor discrimination and threshold. Interestingly, they also found that compared with the normal threshold scores, the individuals with lower scores had a more diverse microbiome [77]. Additionally, Rullo et al. characterized both the oral and nasal microbiome in newly diagnosed neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and healthy controls. In the oral microbiome, Propionibacteriales, Rothia, Staphylococcus, and Cornyebacteriaceae were increased in AMD, while Fusobacterium and Bacilli were higher in controls. In the nasal microbiome, Actinomycetaceae, Gemella, Proteobacteria, Actinomyces, and Veillonella were significantly higher in AMD, and when compared with controls, Streptococcus underwent the largest relative shift in AMD. Although not relatively abundant, Burkholderiales were also significantly increased in AMD, while Clostridia were increased in the control group [78]. More studies are desired to elucidate the relationship between the oral and nasal microbiome and aging in order to prevent upper respiratory tract infection [76] and subsequent lower respiratory tract, such as lung (which is covered in the next section) infections.

More and more evidence show that there are also diverse resident microbes in healthy lungs. The main phyla are Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria [79]. The microbiome of the lung tissue is still largely unknown, and many studies have linked changes in the lung microbiome to the development of chronic lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the complex relationship between lung microbiota and disease remains to be elucidated. The surface of healthy lung is a dynamic environment, and debris and microorganisms from the mouth and nose continue to enter this respiratory organ, and the ciliary cells of the bronchus can remove these debris and invading bacteria through rhythmic movement.

Studies have shown several factors that are related to changes in lung microbiology, such as air pollutions, smoking, aging, and diseases. For instance, air pollution caused an increase in the relative abundance of potentially pathogenic bacterial groups such as Streptococcus and Neisseria [83]. The characteristics of the lung microbiome also change with the natural process of aging. Evidence has shown the loss of diversity of lung microbiota with increasing age and lung disease severity [79, 84], and antibiotic exposure was strongly associated. Aging-related immune dysfunction also affects the lung microbiome [84, 85]. A recent analysis of the lung microbiota of 167 severe asthma patients also revealed significant differences among patients with different inflammatory phenotypes [86].

The human skin is inhabited by a large and diverse community of both bacteria and fungi that contributes to the protection against invading pathogens and educates the IS [87, 88]. The composition of the skin microbiome primarily depends on the physiology of the skin site: for instance, sebaceous sites are usually dominated by Propionibacterium members, whereas moist areas, such as feet and elbow’s bend, are usually populated by Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium [89, 90]. This is related to the fact that microbes inhabiting skin are selected based on their ability to utilize resources present in sweat, sebum, and/or the debris of dead skin cells present in the outermost layer of human epidermis [88].

More studies, on larger and more geographically spread populations, will offer a comprehensive view of the microbiome changes that occur along with the aging process on the human skin, ultimately providing useful and exploitable information in the field of treating and preventing age-related skin disorders. For instance, elderly is a subgroup of patients with distinct atopic dermatitis manifestation with respect to atopic infants, children, and adults [101], with the atopic problem possibly opening the way to bacterial skin infections [102]. Since it is known that skin microbiome, and in particular an increase colonization by Staphylococcus aureus, contributes to the exacerbation of atopic dermatitis [103], it is necessary to understand if and how age-related modification in the skin microbiome, in the different sites, can favor a skin microecosystem in which atopic manifestations, as well as their infectious consequences, are promoted.

Vaginal microbiome is probably the most studied human microbial ecosystem after the gut, because of its well-known relationship with the women health status [104]. Consistently across the whole literature, a vaginal environment dominated by Lactobacillus species is associated with vaginal health, with this group of bacteria being considered as keystone for the ecological balance of the vaginal environment. Lactobacillus species are responsible for the production of metabolites such as lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, which contribute to the maintenance of the healthy value of vaginal pH, as well as the creation of a microenvironment in which colonization by anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens is prevented [105–107]. The recent extensive application of NGS to vaginal samples across different population and physiological conditions allowed for the categorization of vaginal microbiome into a discreet number (5 to 8) of community state type (CST), characterized by different degree of dominance of different Lactobacillus species (i.e., L. iners, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. jensenii) or by the absence of such dominance. CSTs deprived of a strong Lactobacillus dominance and enriched in other, often anaerobic, bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus, Atopobium, Megasphaera, Prevotella) were associated to a higher probability of disease or poor health outcome, such as bacterial vaginosis and pre-term delivery [108–111]. In spite of these few possible configurations, the vaginal ecosystem strikes as particularly dynamic and undergoes compositional and functional changes along the woman life, in relation to hormonal changes, the most evident being puberty, pregnancies, and the beginning of menopause. Smoking, diet, hygiene, and sexual practices add complexity to the description of the vaginal microbiome dynamics [104, 112]. While puberty is known to represent the moment of the most dramatic changes in the vaginal microenvironment [112], pregnancy is of outmost interest because of the proven contribution of vaginal microbiome to pre-term labor and delivery [110, 111]; menopause-related changes in vaginal ecosystem have started to interest research only during the last decade [113–118].

Menopause causes modifications of the vaginal environment that include decrease of the mucus layer width, estrogen level, and glycogen production. Such physiological changes are accompanied by modifications in the resident microbiome that includes a depletion in the proportion of Lactobacillus members, as well as a general decrease in the absolute number of colonizing bacteria and, consequently, an increase in biodiversity and vaginal pH [112, 118]. The focus of the majority of the research in this field has been how these microbiome changes are connected with genitourinary symptoms that are experienced by a large number of aging post-menopausal women. Indeed, vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) and genitourinary symptoms of menopause (GSM, including burning, dryness, irritation, and so on) are experienced by approximately half of western post-menopausal women [112, 119]. It was reported that post-menopausal women with none to mild symptoms had significantly higher Lactobacillus predominance, and consequently lower biodiversity, than those complaining of more severe vaginal symptoms, whose samples were found enriched in bacteria such as Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Peptoniphilus, and Bacillus [114]. Later on, Brotman and colleagues confirmed that post-menopausal women with the most severe VVA showed a vaginal CST belonging to the group IVA, i.e., the one without Lactobacillus dominance and enriched in Anaerococcus, Peptoniphilus, Prevotella, and Streptococcus. Even if such studies did not provide answer to the chicken-and-egg question (VVA and GSM-related changes in microbiome cause or are caused by menopausal symptoms?), it was a natural evolution of the research field to wonder if therapies improving menopause-associated disturbances also had some effect on vaginal microbiome. Indeed, several studies showed that hormone replacement therapy, besides being effective in reducing menopausal symptoms [120, 121], influences the vaginal microbiome in a positive manner, by increasing the Lactobacillus amount and favoring the re-establishment of a vaginal microenvironment more similar to the one found in pre-menopausal women, i.e., higher glycogen production and lower pH [112, 117, 118]. Based on this, even if the relationship between estrogen level and vaginal microbiome in menopausal women has yet to be thoroughly explored, it is suggested that the maintenance of a vaginal microbiome dominated by Lactobacillus is relevant for ensuring a good quality of life for post-menopausal women. For this reason, the possibility of probiotic usage, orally or locally administered, during the management of VVA in aging women has been proposed and explored [122, 123]. A few studies highlighted that Lactobacillus-based products have the ability to increase the Lactobacillus dominance in post-menopausal women [124–126].

Advances in our understanding of human microbiota especially GM and host interaction has stimulated our interest in other mucosal sites such as the genito-urinary tract microbiome (GUTM). Bladder and lower urinary tract were misunderstood as sterile for a long time. Although in normal physiological conditions, the commensals in GUTM were less abundant but highly variable compared with that in the gut [127], there are several genera commonly observed, such as the most dominant genera Lactobacillus and Gardnerella in healthy female cohorts [128, 129] and Lactobacillus and Streptococcus in healthy male cohorts [130, 131]. However, there are not always consistent results among studies for the commensals in the GUTM, which may be caused by the different types of samples and detection methodology [132]. Despite significant differences in gross anatomy and physiology of the lower urinary tract for females and males [133], the urine microbiota in the male and female are dispersed clustered into several “urotypes” rather than have a clearly separated clustering [134]. It is worth noting that the diversity of urine microbiota in healthy men is larger than that of healthy women [134]. Although the urine microbiota may have linkage with vaginal microbiota and seminal microbiota (which was well summarized in review) [135], it was not strongly influenced by the distal regions of the urogenital tract. Whereas a significant overlap between the bladder and vaginal microbiota was identified in a recent study [127], which reveals an interconnected GUTM. Currently, there is no direct comparison between the bladder microbiota (or clean-catch urine microbiota) and seminal microbiota, while comparison of the bacterial communities in semen with those of first catch urine did demonstrate that these specimens shared one-third of species [136]. Till now, there remain some doubts on whether different urogenital sites harbor a unique microbiome.

A summary of the findings on the association of aging with changes in microbiomes from the different body sites described in this review is reported in Table
2.

The human body and its microbiome represent an integrated meta-organism, which results from million years of reciprocal adaptation and functional integration conferring significant advantages for both parties. All the members of this human microbiota participate in host physiology and change according to development and late in the life contributing to health and fitness. The human IS is influenced by the microbiota assembly, composition, diversity, and dynamics, and the interaction of all these features plausibly contributes to the process of inflammaging (Fig. 2). In the last decades, we experienced an explosion of studies on the role of GM in health and disease and the relationship between GM and the other organs and tissues also due to an improvement of the sequencing methods that can be applied to the study of microbiota.

Efforts to standardize specimen preparation and analytical protocols and to increase the availability of the growing body of data should be increased. These technical efforts as well as robust clinical research will improve characterization of the variation in the global human microbiomes, functions of redundancy, disease biomarkers, immigration, effect of lifestyles, and trajectories of development, all of which will establish the basis to understand the progression from health to disease and to efficiently discover new preventive strategies and therapies.
