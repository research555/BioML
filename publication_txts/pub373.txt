Batch effect exerts a bigger influence on the rat urinary metabolome and gut microbiota than uraemia: a cautionary tale

Rodent models are invaluable for studying biological processes in the context of whole organisms. The reproducibility of such research is based on an assumption of metabolic similarity between experimental animals, controlled for by breeding and housing strategies that minimise genetic and environmental variation. Here, we set out to demonstrate the effect of experimental uraemia on the rat urinary metabolome and gut microbiome but found instead that the effect of vendor shipment batch was larger in both areas than that of uraemia.

Twenty four Wistar rats obtained from the same commercial supplier in two separate shipment batches underwent either subtotal nephrectomy or sham procedures. All animals undergoing subtotal nephrectomy developed an expected uraemic phenotype. The urinary metabolome was studied using 1H-NMR spectroscopy and found to vary significantly between animals from different batches, with substantial differences in concentrations of a broad range of substances including lactate, acetate, glucose, amino acids, amines and benzoate derivatives. In animals from one batch, there was a complete absence of the microbiome-associated urinary metabolite hippurate, which was present in significant concentrations in animals from the other batch. These differences were so prominent that we would have drawn quite different conclusions about the effect of uraemia on urinary phenotype depending on which batch of animals we had used. Corresponding differences were seen in the gut microbiota between animals in different batches when assessed by the sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, with higher alpha diversity and different distributions of Proteobacteria subtaxa and short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria in the second batch compared to the first. Whilst we also demonstrated differences in both the urinary metabolome and gut microbiota associated with uraemia, these effects were smaller in size than those associated with shipment batch.

These results challenge the assumption that experimental animals obtained from the same supplier are metabolically comparable, and provide metabolomic evidence that batch-to-batch variations in the microbiome of experimental animals are significant confounders in an experimental study. We discuss strategies for reducing such variability and the need for transparency in research publications about the supply of experimental animals.

The lack of reproducibility in pre-clinical animal research remains a major challenge in experimental biology [1] and is at least partially explained by variation between animal microbiomes [2]. Animal research has been based on the assumption that whilst experimental animals in different facilities may have differences at species level between their gut microbiota [3], at a population level, in healthy laboratory animals on identical diets, these diverse collections of microorganisms achieve a shared set of basic metabolic functions—an assumption supported by evidence of significant functional redundancy within gut microbial communities [4].

Based on an assumption of metabolic similarity between experimental animals, we sought to investigate this ‘gut-kidney axis’ in a rodent model of uraemia, by demonstrating the effect of experimental uraemia on the urinary metabolome and gut microbiota of rats, purchased from the same supplier in two separate shipment batches for logistical reasons. We actually found that the effect of shipment batch had a larger effect in both areas than uraemia and that conclusions drawn about the effect of uraemia on gut-derived metabolites would have been radically different depending on the batch of animals used.

We obtained 24 wild-type outbred Wistar International Genetic Standard (IGS) rats in two shipment batches, 3 weeks apart, from the same supplier (Charles Rivers, Kent, UK). Fourteen were rendered uraemic by undergoing a two-stage subtotal (five-sixth) nephrectomy (eight from batch 1, six from batch 2), whilst 10 underwent sham procedures (six from batch 1, four from batch 2, Fig. 1a). There were no differences in animal husbandry or diet between batches. At the time of sacrifice 8 weeks later, the urinary metabolome was assessed by untargeted proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy, and composition of the gut microbiota was assessed by sequencing 16S rRNA gene amplicons. All animals undergoing subtotal nephrectomy developed an expected uraemic phenotype, including elevations in serum urea and creatinine, weight loss, and polyuria compared to sham-operated controls, and there were no gross phenotypic differences between animals from different batches (Fig. 1b–f; Additional file 1).

The 33 OTUs showing significant compositional differences between batches were drawn from five different phyla. In keeping with the higher alpha diversity seen in samples from batch 2 animals, 30/33 differentially abundant OTU between batches were seen in higher abundances in animals from this batch. Interestingly bacterial genera known to possess significant metabolic potential were prominently represented amongst these differentially abundant organisms, including a number of producers of short-chain fatty acids (Roseburia, Butyricicoccus, Butyrivibrio and Acetomaculum) and three from the phylum Proteobacteria.

The rodent gut microbiome is a complex community of several hundred different bacterial species that possess significant metabolic potential of immense relevance to the host organism. It has previously been demonstrated that this community differs according to a variety of factors including host age [9] and genetics [10, 11], caging arrangements [9, 11, 12], bedding material and water sterilisation technique [13] and vendor shipment batch [10]. Xiao et al. generated a catalogue of the mouse metagenome by sequencing faecal material from 184 mice and found that vendor was a prime determinant in variation at a genetic and function level [14].

Such batch variations could easily lead to spurious positive results. For example, a group that demonstrates an effect in response to an experimental intervention with a small group of animals may decide to increase the number of animals in order to publish their findings; they purchase new animals from the same supplier, but fail to reproduce their earlier results because the new additions have significantly different microbial metabolic potential. Even worse, they may have carried out interventional procedures on one batch of animals, and then used animals from a different batch as controls, with exaggerated differences between groups reflecting underlying differences in microbiomes rather than any effect of the experimental procedure. The alternative in each case—to re-run the whole experiment with animals purchased in a new, single batch—may be prohibitively expensive, may fail to reproduce the initial results and seems to stand against the second of the ‘Three R’s’ governing ethical use of animals in research: the reduction of the number of animals used [25].

It is crucial that publishers maintain the requirement to document fully all aspects of animal use, including purchase details of the different batches of animals used in a study if these come from a commercial supplier. Furthermore, steps should be taken to reduce the amount of variation within batches, such as by using a standardised procedure for moving bedding between cages, which has been shown to reduce intra-batch variation [26]. Many experimental groups breed their own animals, which may reduce intra-group variation, although potentially at the expense of generalisability with results from other laboratories. Statistical approaches including percentile normalisation have been suggested that would allow pooling of data between different batches on experimental subjects in different settings, although for this to be successful, large numbers of control subjects are required [27].

Finally, batch variation can be embraced as a reflection of real-world microbial variation. For this to be successful, it is important that researchers use unsupervised PCA plots of all experimental subjects, coloured according to batch, for quality control, using statistical methods to measure the effect of batch variation. Documenting whether the same observed changes were seen in animals from all batches, or whether different batches behaved differently, is helpful in assessing the generalisability of results, and many journals already have such requirements in place. An experiment showing the same effect in two or more smaller but separate batches of animals may be more striking than an experiment showing a larger effect size in a single animal batch.

Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, with local ethical committee approval. All animal works were carried out at the Biological Services Unit of Queen Mary University of London at Charterhouse Square, and complied fully with all relevant animal welfare guidance and legislation. The 24 male, outbred Wistar IGS rats were obtained from Charles Rivers (Kent, UK) in two shipment batches 3 weeks apart. All were housed in individually ventilated cages under 12-h light/dark cycles and were allowed unlimited access to water and chow (RM1 diet from Special Diet Services, Essex, UK).

Following surgery, rats were weighed weekly. There were up to four rats per cage, and the animals were initially housed according to surgical intervention (subtotal nephrectomy or sham) for 2 weeks after the second stage surgery, before some were moved into mixed cages comprising both uraemic and control animals (this was in order to assess the role of individual cage variants, which on subsequent analysis, not presented here, was found not to be as important in explaining the key changes in urinary metabolome or gut microbiome as shipment batch or treatment class). There was no co-housing between batches. Each week, the animals were housed individually in metabolism cages to allow the collection of a 24-h urinary specimen which was frozen at − 80 °C until the time of analysis. Rats were killed by lethal injection of sodium thiopentone (LINK Pharmaceuticals, Horsham, UK), and caecal fluid was expressed, stored in foil and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then at − 80 °C until the time of analysis. Blood samples were taken by cardiac puncture, and after centrifugation, the serum was frozen at − 80 °C until the time of analysis.

Quantification of serum urea and creatinine was done by IDEXX Bioresearch, Ludwigsberg, Germany.

Urine samples were randomised prior to dilution with buffer and running on the machine to remove potential for technical batch effects in processing and analysis, and prepared for 1H-NMR spectroscopy as described previously [28]. All samples were analysed on an NMR spectrometer (Bruker) operating at 600.22 MHz 1H frequency.

The NMR spectral profiles were digitised and imported into Matlab (Mathworks) using in-house scripts (Additional file 3). The raw spectra were adjusted for 24-h urine volumes by multiplying all NMR absorbance values by the urine volume in millilitres. The peaks for water and trimethylsilylpropanoic acid (TSP) were excised from the raw NMR spectra which were then aligned to adjust for variation in peak shift due to pH differences. Further normalisation was carried out using the probabilistic quotient method between samples in order to ensure comparable baselines between samples (Additional file 2).

Unsupervised PCA was used to identify sources of variation in the metabolic data. This was followed by supervised OPLS-DA analysis using both shipment batch and treatment class as the response variable. In-house-developed scripts were used to perform these multivariate statistical analyses. Peak integrals were calculated from metabolite peaks identified as discriminatory from the OPLS-DA models. Comparisons between these integrals were used to calculate differences in relative abundance according to shipment batch and treatment class using Microsoft Excel, with the Student’s t test and Welch’s correction used to assess significance. These p values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method [8] and a false discovery rate of 0.15 using the q values [29] package in R (Additional file 4).

DNA was extracted from samples of caecal fluid using the DNeasy PowerSoil kit from QIAGEN, used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples were processed using the same kit, and a negative ‘kitome’ control was also included with samples [30]. DNA diluted to 10 ng/μL (in 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.5) was submitted to the Centre for Genomic Research at the University of Liverpool for library preparation and sequencing of the V3/V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. Sequence data were processed using QIIME v1.9 [31]. Paired-end data were joined using join_paired_ends.py, and primer sequences removed from split library files using cutadapt [32]. OTUs were picked using 99% BLAST identity using usearch; from these, a representative set of OTUs was selected. Sequences were aligned (PyNAST) against Silva v128 [33], and this database was also used to assign taxonomy. Singletons, mitochondria-, cyanobacteria- and control-associated OTUs were removed from the OTU table, as were OTUs unaffiliated with any taxonomic group. Data were then rarefied to 100,000 reads to account for differences in sequencing depth across samples and these relative abundances were used to calculate the overall abundances by phylum presented in Fig. 3d.

Raw (unrarefied) OTU abundance data were imported into R for analyses using Phyloseq [34] (Additional files 5 and 6). A phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA v7.0 [35] and rooted to a random node using the R package phytools [36]. A pseudocount of 0.001 was added to all OTU abundances to avoid calculating log-ratios involving zeros, and then data was then made compositional through isometric log-ratio transformation using the R package philr [37]. Ordination was carried out using the ‘ordinate’ function in Phyloseq, based on Euclidean distances in philr space. Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was carried out using the ADONIS command in the R package vegan [38]. OPLS-DA models were built using the ropls package in R [39]. Alpha diversity was assessed using Phyloseq. Compositional analysis of the microbiota at six taxonomic levels was based on isometric log-ratio transformation of raw sequence abundances and adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, carried out using the ANCOM statistical framework [40] in R, with code obtained from the author’s webpage: https://sites.google.com/site/siddharthamandal1985/research.

In order to achieve uniformity, most figures except those demonstrating NMR spectral data were generated using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, California). NMR spectra and related figures were created using Matlab (Mathworks) with in-house scripts.
