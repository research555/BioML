Chronic Kidney Disease and Gut Microbiota: What Is Their Connection in Early Life?

The gut–kidney interaction implicating chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been the focus of increasing interest in recent years. Gut microbiota-targeted therapies could prevent CKD and its comorbidities. Considering that CKD can originate in early life, its treatment and prevention should start in childhood or even earlier in fetal life. Therefore, a better understanding of how the early-life gut microbiome impacts CKD in later life and how to develop ideal early interventions are unmet needs to reduce CKD. The purpose of the current review is to summarize (1) the current evidence on the gut microbiota dysbiosis implicated in pediatric CKD; (2) current knowledge supporting the impact of the gut–kidney axis in CKD, including inflammation, immune response, alterations of microbiota compositions, short-chain fatty acids, and uremic toxins; and (3) an overview of the studies documenting early gut microbiota-targeted interventions in animal models of CKD of developmental origins. Treatment options include prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, etc. To accelerate the transition of gut microbiota-based therapies for early prevention of CKD, an extended comprehension of gut microbiota dysbiosis implicated in renal programming is needed, as well as a greater focus on pediatric CKD for further clinical translation.

Up to 10% of the population worldwide is affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD) [1]. CKD can be attributed to different negative conditions in early life [2,3,4], and therefore, World Kidney Day 2016 made efforts to keep the public informed of the need to focus on kidney disease in childhood and the antecedents of adult kidney disease [5]. During development, the fetal kidney is susceptible to a suboptimal in utero environment, resulting in alterations in function and structure by so-called renal programming [6]. The phenomenon of adverse conditions during organ development resulting in adult disease in later life is now termed “developmental origins of health and disease” (DOHaD) [7]. Conversely, adverse fetal programming could be reprogramming before clinical onset of the disease by early therapeutic intervention [8]. Accordingly, a shift of focus from treatment of established CKD towards the prevention of kidney disease in the earliest stage is highly needed.

This scoping review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) to identify and examine the evidence around the impact of gut microbiota behind the programming of kidney disease evidence documenting prevention of CKD and its related complications by early-life gut microbiota-targeted therapy [30]. Our search strategy was designed to retrieve literature relating to DOHaD, gut microbiota, and pediatric kidney disease from PubMed/MEDLINE databases. We used the following search terms: “chronic kidney disease”, “developmental programming”, “DOHaD”, “reprogramming”, “gut microbiota”, “probiotics”, “prebiotics”, “synbiotics”, “postbiotics”, “mother”, “pregnancy”, “gestation”, “offspring”, “progeny”, “uremic toxin”, “nephrogenesis”, “nephron number”, “kidney”, “aryl hydrocarbon receptor”, and “hypertension”. Additional studies were then selected and assessed based on fitting references in eligible papers. The last search was conducted on 25 January 2022.

The development of the human kidney starts at week 3 and ends at week 36 of gestation [31]. Hence, term neonates are born with a full complement of nephrons. In each kidney, the average number of nephrons, the basic unit of a kidney, is approximately 1 million with 10-fold interindividual differences [32]. Adverse in utero events could interfere with nephrogenesis, resulting in a reduction of nephron numbers and a wide range of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) [33]. Reduced nephron number causes glomerular hyperfiltration and compensatory glomerular hypertrophy, consequently initiating a vicious cycle of further nephron loss [34]. Accordingly, reduced nephron number could act as a first trigger to increase the offspring’s vulnerability to CKD throughout their later life.

Although the risk of CKD has been evaluated in plenty of human studies, interventions required to prove causation and to elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Most of our knowledge regarding the critical window of vulnerability for insults, the types of insults driving renal programming, potential core mechanisms behind renal programming, and therapeutic strategy arise out of studies in animal models.

Trillions of microbes living in the gut—the gut microbiota—have coexisted with humans in a state of mutually beneficial cohabitation. A diversity of environmental factors can induce gut microbial imbalance (i.e., dysbiosis), which in turn can affect human health and disease [49]. Although the role of gut microbiota in adulthood advanced CKD has been extensively reviewed elsewhere [14,25,50,51], less attention has been given to investigate its impact in early stages of kidney disease. Therefore, this section mainly discusses evidence supporting the role of early-life gut microbiota in humans, with an emphasis on pediatric CKD.

Although microbes colonize the neonatal gut immediately following birth [52], microbial colonization continues to develop and vary in species abundance until a typical adult-like gut microbiota is established at the age of 2–3 years [53]. A variety of maternal factors and early-life events determine the establishment of the gut microbiome, such as gestational age, type of delivery, maternal conditions, formula feeding, antibiotic exposure, and ecological factors [52,53,54,55].

Moreover, several environmental chemicals that pregnant mothers are likely to be exposed to are associated with developmental origins of kidney disease [62]. Among them, exposure to heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and dioxins also affect the gut microbiome, accompanied with the development of adult diseases [63]. All of these studies suggest that the early-life microbial alterations after the CKD-related adverse insults may be involved in the development of kidney disease in later life.

The pathogenic interconnection between the gut microbiome and kidney diseases is termed the gut–kidney axis [14], which is implicated in CKD and its comorbidities. A paucity of data exists regarding how the gut–kidney axis functions in the pediatric population with CKD and what the impact of the gut microbiota is in this process. However, a great deal of work on the impact of the gut–kidney axis in established CKD has been conducted, including gut barrier dysfunction, inflammation, immune response, alterations of microbiota compositions, dysregulated SCFAs and their receptors, uremic toxins, etc. (Figure 1). Each of them are discussed.

Together, the interaction between gut microbiota and CKD is bidirectional: CKD may affect the structure of the gut microbiota and contribute to gut dysbiosis, while dysbiosis in CKD patients may increase uremic toxin levels that in turn contribute to CKD progression. Considering the gut is a potential cause of CKD-related complications, gut microbiota-targeted therapeutic strategies in CKD will have a considerable impact on CKD management.

Table 1 summarizes the alterations of gut microbiota and its related metabolites in pediatric kidney disease, as reported in the literature [83,84,85,86,87,88,89]. The study of the gut microbiome in children with kidney disease mainly focused on three types of dysbiosis: loss of diversity, shifts in keystone taxa, and alterations of microbial metabolites.

Data on age are presented as mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range); PD = peritoneal dialysis; HD = hemodialysis; CKD = chronic kidney disease; INS = idiopathic nephrotic syndrome; CAKUT = congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract; DMA = dimethylamine; TMA = trimethylamine; TMAO = trimethylamine-N-oxide; ABPM = 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.

In 20 children with INS who received oral prednisone therapy, abundance of genera Romboutsia, Stomatobaculum, and Cloacibacillus was increased after a 4-week initial therapy [87]. Another study recruited 20 children with INS and showed that probiotic treatment protected against relapse and coincided with increases in butyrate-producing bacteria and blood regulatory T cell (Treg) counts [89]. Considering gut microbiota shapes, the Th17/Treg balance, and Th17 involved in renal inflammation, probiotic treatment may have beneficial effects impacting the gut–kidney axis via immune regulation.

Recently, researchers have increasingly turned their attention on gut microbiota and its derived metabolites as a potential target for therapeutics [81,82,93,94]. In clinical practice, the most generally used gut microbiota-targeted therapies are probiotics and prebiotics. Probiotics are live bacteria that have health benefits when administered [93]. Prebiotics can promote the growth and activity of beneficial bacteria [93]. Synbiotics refer to a mixture comprising probiotic and prebiotics that also confers a health benefit. Additionally, the use of substances leased or produced through metabolism of the gut microbes, namely postbiotics, have shown a positive effect on the host [94]. Another gut microbiota-targeted therapy is fecal microbial transplantation (FMT). Although FMT is being broadly studied in microbiome-associated pathologies [95,96], its potential application for the treatment of CKD remains largely unknown. Moreover, treatment with oral intestinal absorbent AST-120 can reduce microbiota-derived uremic toxins [97]. Although AST-120 treatment has shown cardiovascular benefits in adult patients with CKD [98,99], its influence on gut microbiota compositions and other CKD-related complications remains limited. A summary of potential gut microbiota-targeted therapies in the treatment of developmental programming of CKD and its comorbidities is illustrated in Figure 2.

To date, limited data are available to examine whether alterations of gut microbiota by microbiota-targeted therapies can protect against CKD progression and its comorbidities in the pediatric population. For example, Clostridium butyricum is a butyrate-producing bacteria used as a probiotic [100]. Oral administration of Clostridium butyricum during remission was reported to reduce the frequency of relapse and the need for immunosuppressive agents in children with INS [89]. The protective effect of probiotic therapy was associated with increases in butyrate-producing bacteria and Treg cells. On the other hand, animal studies targeting gut microbiota to prevent the development of CKD and its associated complications have produced some compelling evidence.

Here, we list in Table 2 a summary of studies documenting gut microbiota-targeted interventions in animal models of CKD of developmental origins and its comorbidities [101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110]. The therapeutic duration is during fetal and childhood stages. The literature review states that gut microbiota-targeted interventions used to prevent CKD and its comorbidities primarily include probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics.

Studies tabulated according to types of intervention, animal models, and age at evaluation. TCDD = 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; CKD = chronic kidney disease; TMAO = trimethylamine-N-oxide; ADMA = asymmetric dimethylarginine; SD = Sprague-Dawley rat; DMB = 3,3-maternal dimethyl-1-butanol.

As far as the multifaceted relationship between the gut and kidney, there might be other potential approaches by which the gut microbiota might prevent CKD and its associated complications. For example, RAS blockers are currently the most common therapies used for renoprotection and antihypertension [129]. Considering drug-mediated alterations in the gut microbiota compositions can have beneficial effects on the host [130], a greater understanding of mechanisms driving drug–gut microbiota interactions might aid in guiding the development of microbiota-targeted pharmacological interventions. Together, early microbiota-targeted therapies, in the long term, may enable the capacity to prevent the development of CKD and its comorbidities in a desired favorable direction. However, there is an urgent need to identify and fill the knowledge gaps on gut microbiota-targeted therapies between established CKD and CKD of developmental origins.

Mounting evidence in support of the link between gut microbiota and CKD starting in early life is intriguing but incomplete. One major unsolved problem is the gap in published child- and adult-focused clinical CKD research. Most pediatric CKD studies have limited power due to a small sample size. Although substantial evidence indicates an association between gut microbiota and CKD in adult patients with different stages of CKD and/or various comorbidities, we still lack such information in the pediatric population. Therefore, future work in large multicenter studies regarding CKD and its comorbidities is required to enable the establishment of more robust true relationships in the pediatric population.

In conclusion, gut microbiota dysbiosis is a highly pathogenetic link in the development of CKD and its comorbidities. After all of this significant growth in understanding of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of pediatric CKD and its targeted interventions, it may open new avenues for prevention of CKD in childhood or even earlier in fetal life.
