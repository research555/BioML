The Role of the Human Gut Microbiome in Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Radiation Enteropathy

The human gut microbiome plays a key role in regulating host physiology. In a stable state, both the microbiota and the gut work synergistically. The overall homeostasis of the intestinal flora can be affected by multiple factors, including disease states and the treatments given for those diseases. In this review, we examine the relatively well-characterised abnormalities that develop in the microbiome in idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, and compare and contrast them to those that are found in radiation enteropathy. We discuss how these changes may exert their effects at a molecular level, and the possible role of manipulating the microbiome through the use of a variety of therapies to reduce the severity of the underlying condition.

The human gut microbiome is made up of a collection of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, archaea, and protists [1]. It is a collection of over 1014 microorganisms, and plays a key role in regulating host physiology [2,3].

In contrast, radiation enteropathy is a potentially more valuable human model of gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation and fibrosis. First, patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) for cancer often develop progressive changes that are initiated by the RT, and these changes can be followed over time. Secondly, patients receiving RT for pelvic tumours frequently complain of GI-related symptoms similar to those suffered by patients with IBD—including ulceration and bleeding, diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, haemorrhoids, nausea, and abdominal or anal pain [7]—which significantly affect their quality of life (QoL). These problems caused by RT are sometimes called “pelvic radiation disease” (PRD).

There is a decrease in gut oxygen levels from the duodenum to the large intestine [8]. This is a consequence of the host being able to maintain a high oxygen concentration in the proximal small intestine [8], whilst also delivering nitrate to the distal end [9]. The microbial community composition of the small intestine is therefore dominated by facultatively anaerobic bacteria [10], whereas in the large intestine, there is predominantly obligately anaerobic bacteria as a consequence of limited oxygen and nitrate [11].

An imbalance between these obligate and facultative anaerobes is what characterises IBD dysbiosis [12]. The key factors influencing this imbalance are oxygen and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [13]. The “oxygen hypothesis” suggests there is an increased release of oxyhaemoglobin and ROS into the intestinal lumen due to chronic inflammation of the intestinal walls [14]. Radiation-induced dysbiosis has similarities to IBD, also exhibiting increased levels of ROS [15]. These changes create a microenvironment that favours facultative anaerobes [16,17]. As a consequence, the proportions of obligate anaerobes, such as F. prausnitzii, that release anti-inflammatory compounds are reduced, which leads to increased inflammation [18], creating a positive feedback loop that enhances the disease process [19].

Early studies on animal models have revealed that immune cells are unable to cause inflammation without the presence of intestinal bacteria, thereby indicating a role for the intestinal microbiome in the induction and/or maintenance of local inflammation and disease [20]. This is further supported by the finding that intestinal inflammation is most severe in parts of the bowel with larger bacterial populations [21]. Other studies have shown that specific patterns in microbiotic changes may be linked to the risk of IBD [21].

The changes that have been described in the literature are shown in Table 1. The most consistent alterations detected in the gut microbiota of patients with IBD are a reduction in diversity, particularly of Firmicutes, compared to healthy individuals [22,23,24]. Increases in some species may promote inflammation, while reductions in others may do the same. These changes lead to a reduction in mucosal integrity either directly or by affecting colonic butyrate production, an important fuel for colonic epithelium, or by influencing cytokine production. The mechanisms via which these changes occur are further explained in Figure 1.

A further insight into the role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of IBD is through studies looking at the development of IBD in twins. Previous studies exploring this have reported differences in the gut microbiome composition in IBD-affected twins compared with their healthy co-twins [39,40,41,42,43] (see Table 2).

ICD = Intestinal Crohn’s disease, CCD = colonic Crohn’s disease, UC = ulcerative colitis.

A more recent study by Brand et al. [44] showed no significant differences in the relative abundance of species and pathways between healthy co-twins and their IBD-twins. However, they found an overlap in species, between healthy co-twins and IBD-twins and healthy co-twins and unrelated patients with IBD, respectively. Many of these shared species have previously been associated with IBD, such as Escherichia unclassified. The gut microbiome may therefore display IBD-like signatures that precede the onset of IBD [44]. However, longitudinal follow-up studies are needed to infer a causal relationship [44].

Both curative and palliative cancer patients may receive RT, in combination with chemotherapy, as part of their cancer care [45]. Approximately 50% of all cancer patients receive RT [46], with 90% of those receiving pelvic RT developing a permanent change in their bowel habits [47]. Despite the well-established benefits of RT in oncology, RT-induced toxicities may detract from this, significantly impairing the QoL of patients. Radiation enteritis can be either acute or chronic. The chronic form, more correctly called radiation enteropathy, usually develops between 3 months to many decades after treatment [47], and occurs in approximately 5% to 55% of patients treated with pelvic RT [48]. Severe symptoms arising from chronic radiation enteropathy not only affect cancer patient’s QoL, but also add to the cost of medical treatment by increasing the use of medication for symptom relief, prolonging hospital stays, and temporarily or permanently stopping cancer treatment [49,50].

There is a close relationship between gut microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal injury after RT. This is summarised in Table 3.

The human gut virome contains eukaryotic viruses, prokaryotic viruses, and phages, known as bacteriophages and bacterial viruses (the phageome) [68]. According to the Global Virome Database, phages make up 97.7% of the gut virome, with 2.1% being eukaryotic viruses and 0.1% being prokaryotic viruses [69]. Cross-kingdom interactions between phages and bacteria, and between viruses/phages and the host immune system, underlie the function of the human gut virome in health and disease [70]. The virome population can affect its host in the following ways [70]:

Potential activators of chronic inflammation can be released when enteric eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages kill host cells [71]. The resulting dysbiosis of the enteral system is one of the key factors in the pathogenesis of I BD [72]. Several studies have delineated the events that can occur in inflammatory bowel disease (Table 4). There are no studies yet in patients treated with radiotherapy. As a result of significant improvements in sequencing technology in recent times, the diversity of the enteric human virome is being increasingly revealed, leading to new ways of targeting the gut microbiota to prevent or treat disease [71].

It has been established that toll-like receptors (TLRs) act as the centre of immune responses to microbes in the gut [83]. TLRs are a group of proteins that are expressed by a number of immune cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells [4]. They recognise pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are highly conserved structures of microbes [84]. Upon activation, TLRs induce a number of inflammatory cytokines by mediating the phosphorylation of IκB to activate NF-κB [83]. It also regulates the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), and the proliferation and differentiation of Th1 and Th2 T cells [83].

These compounds may provide the bowel with radioprotection through their effect on the systemic immune system. Furthermore, it is has been established that germ-free mice are more able to withstand radiation-induced bowel injury than conventional mice colonised with the microbiome [110,111]. These findings suggest that a key factor in the development of radiation enteropathy could be the gut microbiota, thus allowing the possibility to prevent or treat radiation enteropathy by manipulating its composition.

There are several ways of regulating the gut microbiota during therapy. One example is the use of mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) proteins when there is a reduction in anti-inflammatory bacteria; these are anti-inflammatory molecules produced by F. prausnitzii [112]. In cases such as this, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and antibiotics can be utilised to replenish anti-inflammatory bacteria and their substrates. Another way is to target the inflammatory bacteria with antibiotics or phage therapy. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can also be used to reset the whole microbiome. Research has shown the therapeutic benefits of the microbiota; for example, altered organisms, whose purposes are to release anti-inflammatory cytokines or other molecules, can be delivered straight to the area of inflammation [113].

Probiotics are microorganisms that are able to withstand the acidic environment of the stomach. A number of ways in which probiotics act have been proposed [114,115,116,117]:

The evidence that probiotic treatment is effective in IBD is outlined in Table 6. Effects may differ slightly in UC and CD, and different strains of probiotics have been trialled under the two conditions. Concomitant use of multiple strains in patients seems to have better outcomes than the use of a single microorganism. The optimal doses have not been determined yet, and a number of studies use doses above what is recommended, while other studies do not state the dose given [38].

Prebiotics are indigestible carbohydrates that are broken down by select bacteria in the intestine, resulting in their growth and providing benefit to their host [133].

There have been several studies in animal colitis models and IBD patients demonstrating the potential benefits of prebiotic use [136,137,138,139,140]. Both inulin and FOS reduced prolonged intestinal inflammation in HLA-B27 transgenic rats through regulation of the gut microbiota, and by increasing the availability of probiotics Bacteroides–Prevotella–Porphyromonas and Bifidobacteria [141]. Moreover, it was found, in IBD models, that these agents play a significant role in reducing 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis by increasing the abundance of probiotics (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) and the production of SCFAs [142]. Although the effects of prebiotics are promising, studies of their use in IBD remain limited and controversial [136]. In short, it cannot be definitively concluded that they improve IBD symptoms [143], and so further research is required to confirm their potential benefits.

Synbiotics are a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics [144,145], and require the prebiotic compound to selectively favour the probiotic organism. They were developed to improve the survival of probiotics when passing through the upper GI tract. The purpose of a synbiotic is, therefore, to facilitate the delivery of a probiotic to the colon and to augment the growth of probiotic strains [146]. Furrie et al. [147] found that there were reduced microscopic inflammatory lesions of the rectal mucosa, and also lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β, following use of a synbiotic consisting of B. longum and oligofructose-enriched inulin in UC patients. However, a study in children with IBD by Hansen et al. [148] did not confirm this finding. Chermesh et al. [149] also found that there was no benefit to post-operative recurrence in 30 patients with CD that were treated with a mixture of four probiotic species and four prebiotics. Nonetheless, there may well be a beneficial effect of using a variety of selected synbiotics on the intestinal mucosa in IBD, but further investigation into their use is required [144].

FMT is a therapy in which faecal matter from a healthy donor is placed into the GI tract of a patient with a chronic condition so that it can be treated by restoring the normal intestinal microbiome [150]. Currently, FMT is frequently used in the management of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections [151]. It has also been shown to be useful in the treatment of patients with IBD, with one meta-analysis showing an effectiveness of 21% in UC and 30% in CD patients [152]. In another study, FMT use was found to be beneficial in 20.9% of patients with mild to moderate IBD, and 32.3% of those with moderate to severe IBD [153]. This suggests that FMT may be more efficacious in those with moderate to severe IBD, and could be considered as an alternative rescue therapy for refractory disease. However, there are substantial differences between recently conducted studies due to variances in transplantation methods and routes, as well as through the use of fresh or frozen faeces and the selection criteria of donors.

The mechanisms through which FMT benefits patients are thought to be associated with the alteration of the intestinal microbiota, with an increase in diversity and the composition shifting towards that of the donor profile [154]. Paramsothy et al. [153] also revealed a rise in the diversity of intestinal flora and an alteration in its composition following FMT [155]. In patients who benefitted from FMT, their faecal and colon samples contained higher levels of Eubacterium hallii, and clinical remission positively correlated with donor stools that contained Bacteroides species [156]. However, there was no response to FMT if the donor stool contained Streptococcus species [157]. Further studies are therefore required in order to ascertain the best way of selecting donors, so that FMT can exert its most beneficial effect on the microbiome changes that occur in IBD patients.

Antibiotics can affect the clinical course of IBD by decreasing bacterial concentrations in the lumen, and also by changing the intestinal microbiota composition to a more advantageous one [117,158]. Table 7 and Table 8 detail the studies that have been performed assessing the use of antibiotics in both active CD and active UC. It is important to note that there is less data concerning the treatment of UC with antibiotics, which consists of studies that contain a small number of patients and a lack of well-designed, placebo-controlled trials [159].

Fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and fibres can all have an impact on the onset of IBD, with a Western diet associated with an increase risk [33]. However, there are no studies assessing similar uses in patients post RT. Therefore, we will only focus on the benefits of following specific diets in terms of the microbiome in IBD (Table 9).

Faecal virome transplantation (FVT) is a refined method of FMT that removes faecal bacteria, thereby decreasing the risk of bacterial infection associated with FMT [190]. Several studies in non-IBD patients have shown much promise for its use (see Table 10).

Although the efficacy of FVT has been established in non-IBD patients, we need to remain cautious as pathogenic eukaryotic viruses can be co-transferred along with phages, and thus pose potential health concerns [195]. This is particularly important in IBD patients and those treated for cancer, who may be immuno-compromised. Nonetheless, FVT presents a very useful method for treating microbiome-dysbiosis-related disease, and so further investigation into its efficacy and safety in this patient group should be performed.

Phage therapy is a process whereby virulent phages are given directly to the patient with the purpose of lysing the bacterial pathogen [196], and so represents a method of restoring intestinal eubiosis.

Although these recent studies on phage therapy are promising, further work is needed to learn more about their use and safety.

Radiation damage to the GI tract can be a severe complication that can contribute to multiple organ failure [206]. It has also been shown in many experimental models that multiple organ failure may be the result of excessive inflammatory responses following intestinal injury [207]. Therefore, targeting early intestinal changes that occur after radiation exposure may help to prevent or reduce radiation syndrome [208]. As used in IBD, the gut microbiota and its metabolites can be effective treatments for radiation-induced intestinal injury.

Probiotics were found, as early as 1988, to be useful treatments for GI symptoms occurring post RT (see Table 12).

These findings share parallels with the use of probiotics in IBD. Therefore, their use as mitigators against radiation toxicity is potentially very exciting, and so it is necessary that further research is conducted with regards to how best to improve the formulation, administration and absorption of these products.

Prebiotics have also been shown to play an important role in immune regulation and have anti-tumour properties. In a randomised trial, Garcia-Peris et al. [215] found that SCFA-producing bacteria, such as Roseburia, were increased in pelvic RT patients who were given a mixture containing inulin and that this reduced the severity of diarrhoea [208]. However, studies assessing the use of prebiotics in patients receiving RT are limited and further work needs to be conducted to explore their potential benefit in reducing the risk of radiation enteritis.

It has been reported that FMT is safe and effective in patients with radiation enteropathy, improving intestinal symptoms and mucosal injury for a certain amount of time [216]. It can also be used to improve the prognosis of cancer patients after RT by ameliorating the toxicity that is caused as a result of radiation damage [217]. Recently, it has also been shown to be a successful treatment in immunotherapy-induced colitis [218]. Potential adverse effects that can occur as a result of transmission from the donor’s faeces may be avoided through careful selection of healthy donors. The standardisation of this therapy and the normalisation of its use are, therefore, two key factors in the usage of this treatment that are required to meet the needs of patients [219]. Additionally, similar to IBD, further studies are required to understand how best to target the microbiome in order to implement the changes needed to alleviate symptoms.

Antibiotics have been shown to be beneficial in the restoration of gut microbes in irradiated mice. It has been reported that an antibiotic cocktail and metronidazole pre-treatment results in less severe intestinal inflammation, which occurs due to a reduced level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the ileum and inhibition of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signalling [26]. In addition, antibiotic pre-treatment regulates macrophage polarisation in the ileum, and downregulates the expression of TGF-β1, phosphorylated Smad-3, and α-SMA, leading to reduced intestinal fibrosis [26,217]. These results provide evidence that antibiotic pre-treatment can be an effective means of easing gut microbial dysbiosis and intestinal injury caused by RT. It will therefore be important to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of radiation enteritis in humans, and the role antibiotics play in alleviating it.

A number of processes can disturb the intestinal flora, as well as conditions, such as IBD and cancer, which alter the health status of the host and, thus, affect the overall homeostasis of intestinal flora. It is crucial that future studies are carried out that use healthy people as a control group, and that assess bacterial function as well as numbers.

This will allow for comparison and may lead to the revelation of bacterial genera that are altered in radiation enteritis. With regards to treatment, the microbiome of those with intestinal damage from radiation can be targeted so that it can be changed to a more healthy composition [220]. Our review has shown the many ways in which this is already being conducted in patients with IBD, and how it can possibly be performed on patients with radiation enteritis. The microbiota are the guardians of our gut, and we should use them to our benefit; this will require the development of considerable collaboration across medical and scientific disciplines, which currently rarely meet.
