Gut Microbiota and Lifestyle Interventions in NAFLD

The human digestive system harbors a diverse and complex community of microorganisms that work in a symbiotic fashion with the host, contributing to metabolism, immune response and intestinal architecture. However, disruption of a stable and diverse community, termed “dysbiosis”, has been shown to have a profound impact upon health and disease. Emerging data demonstrate dysbiosis of the gut microbiota to be linked with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Although the exact mechanism(s) remain unknown, inflammation, damage to the intestinal membrane, and translocation of bacteria have all been suggested. Lifestyle intervention is undoubtedly effective at improving NAFLD, however, not all patients respond to these in the same manner. Furthermore, studies investigating the effects of lifestyle interventions on the gut microbiota in NAFLD patients are lacking. A deeper understanding of how different aspects of lifestyle (diet/nutrition/exercise) affect the host–microbiome interaction may allow for a more tailored approach to lifestyle intervention. With gut microbiota representing a key element of personalized medicine and nutrition, we review the effects of lifestyle interventions (diet and physical activity/exercise) on gut microbiota and how this impacts upon NAFLD prognosis.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of liver disease including simple steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis, in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption [1]. NAFLD is the leading aetiology of liver disease [2], although factors leading to the development of NAFLD and progression to more advanced liver disease are poorly understood [3]. NAFLD is strongly associated with metabolic syndrome and its features including insulin resistance, obesity, hyperlipidemia, low high density lipoproteins (HDL), and hypertension and is considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome [4].

Bacterial evolutionary linages are represented by phylogenetic trees, demonstrating the relatedness of bacteria to one another, classified from life, domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and finally species. The majority of research into gut microbiota has focused on phylum (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, etc.), genus (Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, etc.), and species (Roseburia spp. and Eubacterium spp.).

Historical evidence spanning eight decades has demonstrated a link between the bacteria in the GI system and the liver, present from early fetal life and throughout life [8,12]. The gut microbiota in a healthy individual has been shown to be stable, absent of clinical manipulation (e.g., antibiotics), provided that a healthy diet and physical activity, combined with a healthy lifestyle (e.g., limited alcohol, not smoking, etc.) are maintained [13,14,15,16,17,18]. A healthy balance of bacteria in the GI system ensures that the gut microbiota works in a symbiotic nature with the host and its functions include maintaining a supply of essential nutrients, metabolism, immune response and intestinal architecture [19]. However, a change in the diversity leading to a reduced abundance of beneficial bacteria, with increased prevalence of potentially pathogenic bacteria can occur, which has been termed “dysbiosis” [17]. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been associated with many disease states from early infancy [20], through childhood [21] and into adulthood [18]. Thus, manipulation of the gut microbiome to ensure a non-dysbiotic state offers attractive therapeutic for a range of conditions and overall health status.

Synonymous to NAFLD, inter-patient variability of the gut microbiota is well recognized, with each individual harboring a unique collection of microorganisms from the thousands that can potentially colonize, primarily from the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroides and Actinobacteria [15,22]. Until recently, the majority of research published focused on these phyla, specifically the Firmicutes and Bacteroides, which are dominant in the gut microbiota from year three of life. However, recent advances in the throughput and affordability of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing technologies and associated bioinformatics [23] has facilitated an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of a number of diseases and adverse health conditions including obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and cardiovascular disease [18,24,25,26], all of which are closely associated with NAFLD [4].

NAFLD is a complex disease and with advances in the pathology of the disease new pharmacotherapy treatments are being developed [27,28]. However, lifestyle interventions accompanied by weight loss of between 5% and 10% remain the cornerstone of treatment [27,29]. The effectiveness of lifestyle changes are unprecedented with improvements in metabolic control and liver histology, and when accompanied by greater than 10% weight loss NASH resolution, fibrosis regression and reductions NAFLD activity score [30,31]. However, the difficulty in implementing and maintaining these lifestyle interventions in clinical practice in NAFLD is well documented, with randomized long-term studies lacking [32,33].

This review provides an overview of gut microbiota and its relationship with NAFLD by reviewing published data on how diet, nutrition and exercise modulate the gut microbiota and the liver. The purpose of this review is to assess the impact that lifestyle interventions (excluding pharmaceutical and surgical) have on gut microbiota and how this may interact with NAFLD development and progression.

As the incidence of NAFLD increases [1], the individual and societal burden of its management weigh heavily on health care systems throughout the world, and the need for treatments to combat this is crucial [46]. Although the understanding of NAFLD has increased considerably in the last 20 years, the exact cause of why some people develop more severe forms of NAFLD is not fully understood. The development of NAFLD results from two key factors: (1) greater calories consumed compared to those expended; and (2) genetic susceptibility. Although genetic susceptibility cannot be altered (excluding epigenetic changes), calories consumed and expended can be modified, and has led to a large body of research undertaken investigating the impact of various lifestyle modification interventions [27,29]. Lifestyle interventions that lead to a reduction in weight and/or an increase in physical activity/exercise have consistently been shown to reduce hepatic lipids, improve glucose control and insulin sensitivity [29], and more recently improve liver histology [30,31]. The control of calories consumed vs. those expended may incorporate a number of interventions including exercise/physical activity independent of weight loss [47,48,49], diet modification [50,51,52] or diet and exercise/physical activity [30,31,53,54]. However, why some patients respond to interventions, and others do not is unknown. Modulation of the gut microbiota through the various lifestyle modifications discussed here may provide an insight into the inter-patient variability observed in NAFLD, and improve the number of people who may respond to specific lifestyle interventions to treat NAFLD.

Exposure to environmental factors plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of NAFLD [6], particular dietary intake [55]. A regular healthy balanced diet has been shown to maintain a stable and healthy gut microbiota and reduce the risk of numerous diseases [56,57]. Recent evidence has emphasized the importance of calorie excess, in contrast to macronutrient content, as a major contributor to weight gain [58]. This is particularly important given the highly calorific content of the Western diet (high in fat and carbohydrates), which is associated with an altered gut microbiota and increased risk of developing obesity and NAFLD [35,46,59]. Although there are some conflicting findings, a strong association has been reported between obesity and changes in the gut microbiota, which may be responsible for enhanced energy harvest, weight gain and metabolic syndrome [60,61,62]. The link between the diet and the composition and function of the gut microbiota is unsurprising given that dietary components provide nutrients for bacteria, which then produce metabolites involved in energy balance, metabolism, immune response and the pathophysiology of NAFLD [63,64,65]. Indeed, bacteria in the gut are responsible for the digestion and production of many essential vitamins and minerals. The link between diet, gut microbiota, and health has been elegantly shown in animal models. Animals that were switched from low fat/fiber rich plant diets, to high fat/high sugar diets had significant increases in Bacilli and Erysipelotrichi from the Firmicutes phylum, which were associated with a significant decrease in the abundance of members of the Bacteroidetes phylum [66]. Furthermore, the role of the gut microbiome alone in causing obesity, independent of diet, was first demonstrated by Ley et al. [67] who showed mice transplanted an “obese microbiota” would have significantly greater weight gain than mice transplanted with a “lean microbiota”. The substantial impact of the diet has also been shown in humans, where a rural African diet (high in fiber and vegetables) had a higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and a lower relative abundance of Firmicutes compared with the urban European diet (high in fat and sugar, low in fiber and vegetables). Even more interesting was that the samples from Africa had two bacterial species (Prevottela and Xylanibacter) that were not detectable in the European samples. Further evidence has been reported when comparing a control diet vs. diets high in non-digestible carbohydrates, where the authors reported that the non-digestible carbohydrates produce significant changes in the composition of the gut microbiota within a number of days [62].

Although there are contrasting results in the specific bacterial taxa that are modulated through the diet, the key message is that the diet is able to have a direct and long-term impact on the gut microbiota composition and function, which has a profound implication for health. Any modulation of the diet, such as an increase in non-digestible carbohydrates and/or weight loss has the potential to alter the gut microbiota and potentially disease phenotype, such as NAFLD. This approach of modulating the gut microbiota by modifying the dietary components (fats, proteins and carbohydrates), probiotics (living microorganisms that provide health effects on the host), and prebiotics (ingredients that are selectively fermented and modulate the changes in both the composition and activity of the gut microbiota) has been established for some time, although the links between specific bacteria with disease and mechanisms are often lacking [68]. This paper will now report the impact that macronutrients (fats, proteins and carbohydrates), probiotics and prebiotics manipulation has on the gut microbiota and the NAFLD phenotype.

Although the exact pathophysiology of NAFLD is unknown, the accumulation of lipids in the liver is a key pre-requisite for development and progression [69]. The cause of lipid accumulation in the liver is complex, but has been linked with an influx of fatty acids from fat depots, de-novo lipogenesis, and excess dietary fat intake, leading to steatosis. Increased fat intake is a common finding in NAFLD patients [70,71], thus regulation of fat intake has been highlighted as potential target for therapeutic intervention to reduce hepatic lipids [72]. Contrasting results have been reported in human studies that have used a high fat diet to increase hepatic lipid content [73,74], whereas others have reported no effect of a high fat diet on hepatic lipids [75,76]. The lack of consistency is likely to be due to the duration of the studies (10 days–3 weeks) and the various forms of fat used (saturated, polyunsaturated (PUFA) and mono-unsaturated (MUFA)). Furthermore, in a regular Western style diet the high fat content is normally supplemented by high carbohydrates and therefore it may be the combination of fat and carbohydrates that stimulate the development and progression of NAFLD [77]. The Western diet associated with NAFLD has also been associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis, which represents a potential source for the inter-patient variability observed in NAFLD, and progression from simple steatosis to NASH [36,78].

Although a low fat diet may be preferable for patients with NAFLD, such a considerable change from an established lifestyle will be difficult for patients with NAFLD to incorporate. It is also important to recognize that, in general, a reduction in fat intake is typically accompanied by an increase in carbohydrate content. The data here suggest that changing the type of fat ingested and incorporating a larger proportion of non-digestible carbohydrates into the diet may be effective modulating the gut microbiota, reducing hepatic lipids and ameliorating risk factors associated with NAFLD. However, further work is required to assess the impact of diet on the gut microbiota specifically and further human intervention studies in patients with NAFLD are required to assess this.

Carbohydrates provide a crucial energy source for the host and gut microbiota [25]. Carbohydrate fermentation, specifically non-digestible carbohydrates, is a core activity of the human gut microbiota, driving the energy and carbon economy of the colon [106]. The move towards the Western style diet, which is high in processed carbohydrates and low in non-digestible carbohydrates, has been attributed to the rise and prevalence of obesity and NAFLD in these demographics [8,65,107]. This was recently confirmed in a meta-analysis where fructose was linked with poor liver health, although this was confounded by excessive energy intake, which is likely to be due to high fructose intake [108].

Further treatments to combat the detrimental effects of a high carbohydrate diet may involve increased protein intake, Vitamin E, and cinnamon [128,129,130,131]. All of which have been shown to be effective in reducing weight gain, body fat, adipocyte size, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Although these all show promise, there are currently no data on whether these may be able to modulate the gut microbiota in NAFLD patients and should be explored further. Increased intake of carbohydrates, specifically fructose, is undoubtedly linked with NAFLD, due to either metabolism in the liver or through increasing calories consumed. Replacement of these simple carbohydrates with non-digestible carbohydrates provides potential to have a direct impact upon gut microbiota dysbiosis and have a positive effect on mediators of NAFLD.

Like carbohydrate, an increase in protein in the diet at the expense of carbohydrates and fat had been utilized in a number of fad diets to facilitate weight loss [132]. However, the effect that protein may have on the gut microbiota in humans, and specifically NAFLD are lacking. Furthermore, the small number of studies investigating the effects of high protein diets have predominantly focused on the products produced during fermentation [64]. This is surprising given the amount of protein that reaches the colon in a healthy diet (12–18 g), which would be expected to rise in a high protein diet [133], and provide nutrients for bacterial proliferation. Although an essential macronutrient, excess protein has been linked with potentially damaging effects on the gut microbiota and intestinal structure through toxic substances produced [64,133,134,135]. The small number of studies that have reported the impact that high protein diets have on the gut microbiota have reported high levels of Clostridium spp. and Bacteroides spp., with concurrent reductions in Bifidobacterium spp., Roseburia spp., and Eubacterium spp. [136,137]. The reductions in Bifidobacterium spp., Roseburia spp., and Eubacterium spp. bacterial species are associated with butyrate production, endotoxemia, mucus barrier function, and insulin sensitivity [81,136]. This suggests that the decreases in these bacteria may be detrimental to health and increase the risk of NAFLD [35,36,37,40,138,139].

Overall, there are contrasting evidence on whether diets high in protein may be an effective treatment for gut microbiota modulation and NAFLD management. Discrepancies are likely due to differing study designs, including the source of protein (animal vs. plant protein), varying manipulations of the diets (protein to carbohydrate and fat ratios) populations sampled (Healthy, NAFLD, T2DM, obese, etc.) and study duration. The optimal benefits of diets high in protein to modulate the gut microbiota and aid with NAFLD management strategies should be explored further.

Given the connection between the gut microbiota, diet, and health [65,84], coupled to issues with sustained dietary modification, an alternative approach utilizes pre- and probiotics to indirectly or directly confer beneficial colonizers of the GI, respectively [153]. Although there are various definitions, prebiotics is most commonly referred to as ingredients that are selectively fermented and modulate the changes in both the composition and activity of the gut microbiota [68,154]. Probiotics are different in that they are living (viable) microorganisms which have the ability to provide health effects on the host when provided in adequate amounts, similar to the bacteria that are already present [155].

Fructans are the most extensively studied prebiotics and have been linked with modulation of the gut microbiota (summarized in Table 3), resulting in positive health benefits. In animal models, the administration of prebiotics increased 18 potentially beneficial species, notably Bifidobacterium spp. (Phylum: Actinobacteria) and Bacteroidetes [156,157,158]. Changes in gut microbiota are also associated with appetite regulation, improved glucose tolerance, increased satiety, reduced ghrelin, plasma triglycerides, oxidative stress and inflammation and calories consumed [82,158,159,160].

A recent meta-analysis analyzing 26 randomized controlled trials concluded that prebiotics were effective in increasing satiety and improving insulin sensitivity [169]. While specific effects of prebiotics on the gut microbiota remain poorly understood, the majority of studies have reported increases in Bifidobacteria [170,171,172,173]. Dewulf, et al. [174] also reported an increase in Bifidobacteria, as well as increased levels of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and reductions in Bacteroides intestinalis, Bacteroides vulgatus and Propionibacterium, which they associated with endotoxemia, although they failed to report any changes in plasma endotoxemia. Although these studies demonstrate promise that prebiotics may be used as a potential treatment for NAFLD, further work is required to investigate additional overall changes in the gut microbiome. Rapid advances in NGS and other ‘omic technologies offer promise for more systematic understanding of entire treatment mechanisms. In addition, there are currently no studies that have reported the effects of prebiotics on hepatic lipids or liver histology, and evidence linking specific bacteria with the pathophysiology of NAFLD is lacking.

Probiotics have been suggested as a potential treatment for patients with NAFLD, due to their apparent ability to modulate the gut microbiota (Table 4) and impact upon metabolic control, inflammation, lipid profile and intestinal permeability [155,175], and have been systematically reviewed in detail elsewhere [176]. However, the exact mechanisms of how probiotics are able to do this are not fully understood. Although not exhaustive, proposed mechanisms include direct microbe-to-microbe interaction and competition with pathogenic bacteria potentially leading to eradication and a healthy balance of gut microbiota [62,177]. Furthermore, probiotics have been shown to be effective at improving epithelial barrier integrity [178] and stimulating the host immune response [179,180].

Although existing data suggest probiotics represent a safe and effective treatment option for NAFLD, there are instances where probiotics were ineffective, such as in Crohn’s disease [205] and Helicobacter infections [206]. Such results may simply represent inefficiency of the probiotics selected for these studies and it is plausible different probiotic combinations may yield different results. It should be noted that probiotics are regarded as safe, with little data showing any adverse effects of supplementation. As each disease is uniquely complex, so too must the probiotic selected for treatment, with better characterization of the disease mechanism informing the specific probiotics to use [62]. Important considerations also include the route of administration, dosage, how often to take the treatment, and for how long. As we better understand the most effective means of administering probiotics as well as which specific combinations of bacteria to use, the efficacy of treatment should become apparent. In the era of personalized medicine it is feasible that each NAFLD patient can have their gut microbiota profile determined, allowing probiotics to be tailored to the individual.

Exercise is well recognized for its health benefits and its ability to attenuate the risk of CVD, obesity, mental disorders, diabetes and intestinal diseases [207,208]. More specifically exercise has been shown to be effective at modulating hepatic steatosis and its mediators, improve body composition, liver and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss [29,47,48,49,209]. Furthermore exercise (both endurance and high intensity) training has been shown to attenuate inflammation and improve insulin secretion by upregulating glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion in the GI tract and pancreas [209,210,211]. Despite the strong associations among exercise, liver health, metabolic control and inflammation, evidence linking exercise, the gut microbiota and NAFLD in humans is lacking. Understanding the interplay between the triad and resulting mechanisms in NAFLD will be fundamental to translating therapeutics into clinical practice.

Exercise does appear to be able to modulate the gut microbiota and reduce the risk of NAFLD, however, the mechanism(s) remain unknown. Potential mechanisms include: (1) increased butyrate production, which is linked with colonic epithelial cell proliferation and modulation of mucosal immunity and exclusion of pathogens [215,219,227]; (2) increased primary bile acid secretion and cholesterol turnover [228]; (3) growth of beneficial bacteria [221]; and (4) increased core body temperature and reduced blood flow to the GI system reducing gut transit time and substrate delivery to the microbiota [218,229,230]. Although the exact mechanism remains elusive and methodological bias hinders direct cross-study comparisons, existing data indicate that exercise may be able to modulate the composition, diversity and relative abundance of the gut microbiota in NAFLD patients. Further investigation of the impact of exercise on gut microbiota is required and may address why some patients respond to exercise and some do not.

The gut microbiota has been studied for decades, however, recent developments in 16S rRNA gene sequencing, coupled to advances in computational processing of data has enhanced our understanding of the microbial–host interactions [23]. The gut microbiota has been associated with a range of diseases, from obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [18,24,25,26] to NAFLD [7,34,36,37,38,39,40,41]. However, existing studies are largely focused on profiling the bacterial community and fail to provide functional information between the gut microbiota and the host. Ultimately, it still remains unknown whether the gut microbiome is causing the disease, or simply an effect of disease pathophysiology.

As technologies are increasingly developed and the associated costs are reduced, there is huge potential to systematically determine the importance of both the presence of certain bacteria and their ultimate function is a given community. For understanding such complex processes and interaction at the microbe and host levels, there is a need to integrate multiple techniques in a systems biology approach. A focus on large-scale collaborative studies that explore many relevant biological samples to comprehensively determine disease mechanisms and therapeutic efficiency is necessary. This represents an important time for life sciences and the prospect of advances in diseases such as NAFLD is promising.
