A Pro-Inflammatory Gut Microbiome Characterizes SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients and a Reduction in the Connectivity of an Anti-Inflammatory Bacterial Network Associates With Severe COVID-19



The gut microbiota contributes to maintaining human health and regulating immune responses. Severe COVID-19 illness is associated with a dysregulated pro-inflammatory immune response. The effect of SARS-CoV-2 on altering the gut microbiome and the relevance of the gut microbiome on COVID-19 severity needs to be clarified. In this prospective study, we analyzed the gut microbiome of 212 patients of a tertiary care hospital (117 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 95 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients) using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V3-V4 region. Inflammatory markers and immune cells were quantified from blood. The gut microbiome in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was characterized by a lower bacterial richness and distinct differences in the gut microbiome composition, including an enrichment of the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes and a decrease of Actinobacteria compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. The relative abundance of several genera including Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus and Collinsella was lower in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients while the abundance of Bacteroides and Enterobacteriaceae was increased. Higher pro-inflammatory blood markers and a lower CD8+ T cell number characterized patients with severe COVID-19 illness. The gut microbiome of patients with severe/critical COVID-19 exhibited a lower abundance of butyrate-producing genera Faecalibacterium and Roseburia and a reduction in the connectivity of a distinct network of anti-inflammatory genera that was observed in patients with mild COVID-19 illness and in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome associated with a pro-inflammatory signature may contribute to the hyperinflammatory immune response characterizing severe COVID-19 illness.

Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread globally and evolved to the most severe pandemic of the last 100 years with more than 191.1 million confirmed infected individuals and 4.1 million deaths since December 2019 (accessed 22.7.2021) (WHO, 2020). Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the lungs and fever, cough and dyspnea are the most common clinical manifestations (Guan et al., 2020). COVID-19 is recognized as a multi-organ disease associated with hepatic, nephrological, neurologic, cardiac, and gastrointestinal complications.

This prospective study analyzed the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA gene sequencing in 212 patients with 98% Caucasian ethnicity including 117 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 95 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients of a German tertiary care hospital. SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients did not differ for various variables associated with alterations of the gut microbiome and only 3% of patients were treated with antibiotics at the time point of sampling for both groups. The periods between first symptoms of COVID-19 and rectal swab sampling did not differ significantly between patients of different COVID-19 severity categories. We analyzed the gut microbiome differences linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection and those according to COVID-19 severity illness from rectal swab samples.

This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Duisburg-Essen (20-9237-BO) and was performed in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before enrolment. A total of 212 patients presenting in the tertiary care University Hospital Essen were included between April and November 2020, including 117 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 95 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with other reasons for hospital presentation. SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs was used for detection of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in all patients enrolled in this study. Data collection included anamnesis, clinical examination and letters of the patient’s medical history. Pneumonia was diagnosed by low dose computer tomography of the lungs and was performed in 79 patients with moderate respiratory symptoms. Alternatively, chest x-ray was performed in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. COVID-19 severity illness was classified according to the WHO (Rochwerg et al., 2020). Mild disease was defined as SARS-CoV-2 infection without pneumonia, moderate COVID-19 was classified as pneumonia with a saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) > 90% on room air and typical signs such as fever and cough. Severe COVID-19 was defined as symptomatic pneumonia with SpO2 < 90% on room air and a respiratory rate > 30 breaths per minute or clinical signs of severe dyspnoea. Critical disease was classified by the need of life sustaining treatment e.g. acute respiratory distress syndrome or septic shock. WHO unites mild and moderate disease as non-severe COVID-19. For microbiome analyses assessing differences associated with disease severity, severe and critical COVID-19 patients were assigned to one category (severe/critical) because of the low number of patients with critical COVID-19 (n=12).

Comprehensive blood tests assessing functions of multiple organs including kidney, liver, and bone marrow, as well as blood count and C-reactive protein were available for 113 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from the same day the rectal swab was taken. Additional parameters describing inflammatory response and immune cell characteristics including IL6, sIL-2R and numbers of CD3+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, HLA-DR+ T cells, CD3-CD16+CD56+ NK cells, and CD3+CD16+CD56+ NK T cells were quantified by flow-cytometry in 50 patients 1.5 days after rectal swab sampling.

Rectal swab samples were taken using the DNA/RNA Shield™ Collection Tube with Swab (Zymo Research, Freiburg, Germany) and stored in stabilizing DNA/RNA shield at -80°C until DNA extraction was performed. DNA was extracted using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research) with a bead-beating step using the Fast-Prep device (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) before DNA extraction was performed. Library preparation was performed using the NEBNext® Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit. The V3/V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified with 341F (5′-CCTAYGGGRBGCASCAG-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACNNGGGTATCTAAT-3′) primers and samples were sequenced on NovaSeq 6000 SP flowcell with PE250. DNA stabilizer liquid fluid from the collection tubes undergoing the DNA-extraction procedure and a PCR water sample were used as negative controls.

We analyzed demultiplexed fastq-files of forward and reverse reads per sample using the QIIME2 (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology2) pipeline (Bolyen et al., 2019). Sequences were corrected and quality filtered using the DADA2-package integrated in QIIME2 including filtering of chimeric sequences using the consensus-method. We obtained a total of 16,915,240 quality-filtered sequences of 212 samples with a minimum of 29,676 sequences, maximum of 117,553 sequences per sample and a mean/median number of 79,789/84,742 sequences per sample. We used the q2 diversity plugin for performing different alpha diversity and beta diversity metrics with a rarefaction depth of 29,676 sequences, which represents the sample with the minimum number of sequences. The q2-feature-classifier plugin was used for assigning taxonomy with a Naïve Bayes classifier, trained on the Greengenes 13_8_99% OTUs 16S rRNA gene full length sequences. Alpha diversity metrics, barplots, boxplots and principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) were visualized using Dokdo, Version 1.7. Comparisons between categorical metadata columns and alpha diversity metrics were computed using the qiime diversity alpha-group-significance command with Kruskal-Wallis test. To test for significant differences in beta diversity among groups, we used the qiime diversity beta-group significance command with permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) of distance matrices with 999 permutations. For analysis of differences in the relative taxa abundance between groups, taxa with a relative abundance of at least 0.001% of the total reads were filtered and Kruskal–Wallis test was used for analysis of significant differences between groups using Calypso (Zakrzewski et al., 2017). Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple hypothesis testing was performed when indicated. Biomarkers were assessed using LEfSe (Linear discriminant effect size analysis) (Segata et al., 2011) with a P<.05 for bacterial class comparison using Kruskal-Wallis test and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) score >3.5.

Patient characteristics were tested using t-test for metric variables and Fisher exact test for categorical variables with a significance level <.05 using SPSS software (version 27.0).

The study population included 212 patients in total. Of 117 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, only 4 (3%) were treated with antibiotics before rectal swab sampling, which was comparable to the number of antibiotics-treated patients that were SARS-CoV-2 negative (3 of 95, 3%) ( Table 1 ). Variables that have been associated with alterations of the gut microbiome including ethnicity, sex, body-mass-index (BMI) and smoking status as well as medication taken at the time point of sampling including metformin, proton-pump inhibitors, and corticosteroids did not differ significantly between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. The period between admission to hospital and time point of rectal swab sampling was comparable for both groups as well as the percentage of patients that died in hospital. SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were characterized by slightly higher mean age (56.2 years vs 50.2 years, p=.033), longer hospital stay with a mean of 9 days vs. 4 days (p=.01) and by a higher percentage of patients that were admitted to intensive-care unit during hospitalization (p=.025). Comorbidities did not differ between both groups. The symptoms cough, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, diarrhea and odor disorders were more prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

Data are presented as numbers (%) unless otherwise indicated. Metric variables were tested using t-test with mean ± SD. Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables. ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; SD, standard deviation.

After merging and quality filtering of sequencing reads, we received a total of 16,915,240 sequences for 212 patient samples with a mean of 79,789, a minimum of 29,676 and a maximum of 117,553 sequences per sample. The bacterial richness was significantly lower in SARS-CoV-2 positive compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative patients ( Figure 1A ) while Shannon diversity index and Pielou’s evenness were not significantly different between the two groups ( Supplemental Figure 1A ). Loss of microbial richness of the gut microbiome is associated with chronic diseases and a pronounced inflammatory phenotype (Le Chatelier et al., 2013). Principal Coordinates Analysis and PERMANOVA multivariate analysis of distance matrices of Binary Jaccard, Bray-Curtis and weighted and unweighted UniFrac revealed differences between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients (p=.001 for multivariate analyses of all four distance matrices, Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure 1B ). Interestingly, the relative abundance of three of the four dominating bacterial phyla was significantly different between the two groups. While the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes was significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, the relative abundance of the phylum Actinobacteria was lower in these patients ( Figure 1C ). Of the 20 most abundant genera, 5 were significantly different between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. While the relative abundance of Bacteroides was higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, Streptococcus and Corynebacterium were higher in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients ( Figure 1D ). To further evaluate differences in the gut microbiome between both groups, we performed class comparisons using linear discriminant analysis of effect size (LEfSe) that identified several bacterial taxa that discriminate SARS-CoV-2 positive from SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with LDA score >3.5. LEfSe confirmed enrichment of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla and Bacteroides genus in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and additionally identified a higher relative abundance of pro-inflammatory Enterobacteriaceae and Campylobacteraceae families as a biomarker for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, while Actinobacteria phylum and genera Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, Streptococcus, Corynebacterium, and orders Lactobacillales, Actinomycetales among others were identified as biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 negative patients ( Figures 1E, F ).

The differences in the gut microbiome between SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with and without diarrhea for alpha and beta diversity metrics were minor ( Supplemental Figure 2 ), and LEfSe did not identify any taxon with LDA >3.5 that discriminated patients with and without diarrhea.

According to the World Health Organization classification (WHO) COVID-19 classification, 26 patients of our study were classified as severe COVID-19 with radiological signs of pneumonia, SpO2<90% on room air, respiratory rate >30, and signs of severe respiratory distress. Twelve patients were classified as critical COVID-19 requiring life-sustaining treatment, acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis or septic shock, while 79 patients were classified as non-severe COVID-19 classified by the absence of signs of severe and critical COVID-19 as defined by the WHO ( Table 2 ). Age (P <.001), BMI (p=.053) coronary heart disease (p=.02), hypertension (p=.001), chronic kidney disease (p=.008) as well as ACE-inhibitor, beta blocker (p=.0025) platelet aggregation inhibitor (p=.005), and Remdesivir medication (p=.041) were the variables that were significantly different between the groups according to disease severity. Other variables including diarrhea, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, use of proton pump inhibitors, the period between the first COVID-19 symptoms and gut microbiome sampling and the period between admission to hospital and rectal sampling were not significantly different between the groups according to COVID-19 severity ( Table 2 ). Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 were characterized by higher levels of IL6, C-reactive protein and soluble IL2-receptor expression ( Figure 2A ). The total number of T cells was lower in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to those with mild COVID-19, driven by the lower number of CD8+ T cells. The CD4+ T cell number ( Figure 2B ) as well as the total numbers of B cells (CD19+), NK cells (CD3-CD16+CD56+), natural-killer like T cells (CD3+CD16+CD56+) and HLA DR+ T cells were not significantly different between the groups ( Supplemental Figure 3 ).

Data are presented as numbers (%) unless otherwise indicated. Metric variables were tested using t-test with mean ± SD. Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables. ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; SD, standard deviation.

Compared with the gut microbiome differences between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients, the differences linked to COVID-19 severity were not as prominent. Nevertheless, the relative abundance of the genera Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, both important butyrate-producing bacterial genera, was lower in severe/critical COVID-19 compared with non-severe COVID-19 ( Figure 2C ). These two genera were the only ones that were identified by LEfSe to discriminate COVID-19 patients with severe/critical disease versus non-severe illness with LDA score >3.5. In addition, Faecalibacterium and Roseburia were among the central genera of the largest interconnected cluster of the co-occurrence network of SARS-CoV-2 negative patients and patients with mild COVID-19 severity illness ( Figure 2D ). This cluster also included the bacterial genera Dorea, Blautia, Coprococcus, Lachnospira and two genera of Lachnospiraceae family exhibiting multiple positive correlations among each other. These genera have anti-inflammatory properties and are producers of short-chain fatty acids (Louis and Flint, 2017). Interestingly, positive correlations of Faecalibacterium and Roseburia with most genera of this bacterial cluster detected in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients and patients with mild COVID-19 were not present in moderate and severe COVID-19.

In a European population cohort comprising mainly patients with Caucasian ethnicity, we showed that the gut microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is clearly distinct from that of SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. Bacterial richness was lower in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and the relative abundance of three of the four most abundant phyla differed between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were characterized by a higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria and a lower abundance of Actinobacteria. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were characterized by an increase in Bacteroides genus, and Enterobacteriaceae family and decrease in Bifidobacteria. Patients with severe or critical COVID-19 exhibited an increased inflammatory immune response and their gut microbiome was characterized by a depletion of Faecalibacterium and Roseburia genera and by distinct alterations of bacterial networks ( Figure 3 ).

In summary, we found distinct differences in the gut microbiome in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients of a European cohort characterized by a reduced bacterial richness and a pro-inflammatory microbiome signature. In addition, patients with severe/critical COVID-19 exhibited increased pro-inflammatory immune cell markers and lower number of CD8 + T cells and their gut microbiome was characterized by decreased anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing bacterial genera Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, and alterations of bacterial networks of bacteria with anti-inflammatory properties compared to patients with mild COVID-19 illness.

The dysbiosis in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with a pro-inflammatory signature of the gut microbiome and depletion of butyrate-producing anti-inflammatory bacterial genera as well as differences in bacterial networks in severe COVID-19 suggest that specific alterations of immunomodulatory bacteria contribute to the dysregulated pro-inflammatory immune response in COVID-19 patients with severe illness.
