Gut Microbiome Composition in Non-human Primates Consuming a Western or Mediterranean Diet

The mammalian gastrointestinal tract harbors a highly diverse and dynamic community of bacteria. The array of this gut bacterial community, which functions collectively as a fully unified organ in the host metabolism, varies greatly among different host species and can be shaped by long-term nutritional interventions. Non-human primates, our close phylogenetic relatives and ancestors, provide an excellent model for studying diet-microbiome interaction; however, compared to clinical and rodent studies, research targeting primate gut microbiome has been limited. Herein, we analyze the gut microbiome composition in female cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis; n = 20) after the long-term (2.5 years) consumption of diets designed to mimic recent human Western- (WD; n = 10) or Mediterranean-type (MD; n = 10) diets. Microbiome diversity in MD consumers was significantly higher by the Shannon diversity index compared to the WD consumers, with similar but non-significant trends noted for the diversity metrics of species richness (Chao 1), observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) whole Tree. Compared to the MD, the WD group demonstrated a higher Firmicutes-Bacteroides ratio and a significantly higher abundance of families Clostridiacea and Lactobacillaceae. Further analyses reveal significantly higher abundance of genera Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, and Oscillospira and lower abundance of Ruminococcus and Coprococcus in MD consumers relative to WD consumers. OTUs belonging to several species also show significant differences between the two groups, with Lactobacillus species demonstrating a prominently higher abundance in the MD consumers. The data reveal several differences in the gut microbiome of primates consuming the two different diets and should be useful for further studies aimed at understanding the diet-microbiome-health interactions in primates.

The past decade has been remarkable in revealing the fundamental role of the gut microbiome (a highly complex and diverse community of microbes living within gastrointestinal tract) in human health and diseases [1, 2]. Among various intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect gut microbiome composition and diversity, diet has received appreciable attention because of its potential influence on host health and metabolism [3, 4]. Diet shapes the gut microbiome spectrum by providing substrates that differentially promote the growth and activities of specific microbial communities [5–9]. Diet-microbiome interactions are consistently reproducible in clinical and animal studies [5, 8, 10, 11]. Specifically, many microbiome studies have focused on the effects of high-fat and/or high-sugar vs. low-fat and/or low-sugar diets on the gut microbial populations, particularly with respect to risk of chronic diseases and disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and psychiatric disorders [12–15].

Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) are widely used as models of diet-induced obesity, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and mood disorders [17–19]. Here we report the gut microbiome composition in healthy adult NHPs after long-term (2.5 years) consumption of Western- vs. Mediterranean-type diets.

The current work was conducted in socially housed adult female cynomolgus macaques maintained at the Wake Forest University Primate Center (established 1956; http://www.wakehealth.edu/ccpr). All animals were in apparently good health, free from gastrointestinal infections. The monkeys were randomized to one of two diet groups: Western or Mediterranean diet. Earlier studies of microbiome [20–23] used 3–15 animals to achieve >80% power and an α of 0.05, hence we selected n = 20 animals (n = 10 in each group), and no subjects were excluded from analysis. The monkeys were fed the experimental diets for 30 months (2.5 years), and water was accessible ad libitum.

The western diet (hereafter, WD) consisted of lard, beef tallow, butter, egg, cholesterol, casein, lactalbumin, dextrin, high-fructose corn syrup, and sucrose; while the Mediterranean diet (hereafter, MD) comprised fish oil, olive oil, fish meal, butter, egg, black and garbanzo bean flour, wheat flour, V-8 juice, fruit puree, and sucrose. The detailed composition in terms of the percent of calories in these diets is provided in Table
1.

Individual feeding cages were fabricated and placed inside social group pens. The monkeys were taught to run into their individual feeding cages on voice command, were given 2 h to consume their diet, and released back into the social group pen. The monkeys consumed most of the diet in the first 30 min. Each monkey was offered 100 Cal/kg of diet.

The NHPs were euthanized after the 30-month intervention period. Samples of rectal/anal contents of 10 randomly chosen monkeys from each of the diet groups (n = 20 total) were collected at necropsy and immediately placed in sterile tubes under aseptic conditions and stored at −80°C until further processing. All protocols related to the sampling, care and management of animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Wake Forest School of Medicine.

Nearly 200 mg (wet weight) of each sample was used to extract genomic DNA by using the Qiagen DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) per manufacturer instructions. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the primers 515F (barcoded) and 806R, which flanked the V4 hypervariable region of bacterial 16S rRNA, in accordance with the Earth Microbiome Project protocol [25, 26] with the following minor modification. The PCR reaction consisted 25 μl of SYBR® Premix ExTaqTMII (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan), 1 μl of each of the primers, 5 μl of DNA template, and 18 μl of RNase-free water (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA). PCR conditions comprised an initial step at 50°C for 2 min and at 95°C for 10 min, with subsequent amplification steps at 95°C for 30 s, at 55°C for 30 s, and at 72°C for 90 s for repeated cycles on an Applied Biosystems® 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The amplification step was stopped before the fluorescent intensity reached a plateau. The resulting amplicons were purified using Agencourt® AMPure® XP (Beckman Coulter), quantified using the Qubit-3 fluorimeter (InVitrogen), normalized to an equal concentration (4 nm) and pooled together for 16S Miseq analysis. The sample pool was denatured, diluted to 8 pM and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform, using a MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) as described previously [27]. Sequencing procedure was monitored on the Illumina BaseSpace® website wherein analysis of the data generated on the Miseq platform was executed using the BaseSpace® 16S Metagenomics App (Illumina). Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) assignment to the Greengenes database was performed using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) pipeline software package that enables microbial community analysis [26]. Demultiplexed R1 and R2 sequencing read files were obtained from the Illumina BaseSpace® website and the Illumina reads were quality-filtered, clustered and analyzed using default parameters in QIIME. A total of 1.33 million reads (mean = 51665.50; standard deviation = 21791.5) were generated after filtering. Paired-end reads were joined together with fastq_join_paired_ends.py and split_libraries_fastq.py scripts. The assembled sequences were grouped into OTUs at a sequence similarity of 97% identity and sequences were classified into the taxonomical levels based on the Greengenes 16S rRNA gene database (http://greengenes.secondgenome.com). Representative OTU sequences were aligned to a Greengenes reference alignment [25]. De novo OTUs were classified using RDP classifier and the Greengenes reference set with a minimum 80% confidence threshold [28]. Samples were rarified at an even sequencing depth of 10,000 reads per sample for subsequent downstream analyses.

Taxonomy assignment and diversity analyses were computed through QIIME with default settings to compare bacterial species richness between the two diet groups. Bacterial composition of each sample was measured at various taxonomic levels using QIIME. Alpha diversity (rarefaction curve for observed OTUs, Chao1, PD_Whole_Tree and Shannon) indices were computed with core_diversity_analysis.py script. Beta diversity was generated within QIIME by using weighted and unweighted Unifrac distance matrices. UniFrac distances are appraised as the distance between bacterial communities explaining phylogenetic relationship between bacteria. Principal components analysis (PCA), an unsupervised analysis that allows estimation and visualization of sample distribution based on UniFrac distance patterns, was performed to determine the influence of dietary treatments on the overall microbiome composition of the samples. PCA plots were visualized using EMPeror version 0.9.3-dev. Unweighted PCA was used to determine if the NHP microbiome phenotypes clustered by the type of diet. The data of bacterial diversity and abundance between the two diet groups were compared by using non-parametric analyses in R statistical software package (version 3.4.3; https://www.r-project.org/). Statistically significant differences between two groups were calculated by Mann–Whitney U-test with Bonferroni correction. Statistical significance in alpha-diversity was calculated by non-parametric two-sample t-tests with 9999 Monte-Carlo permutations. Difference in beta-diversity was examined by permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), a permutation-based extension of multivariate analysis of variance to a matrix of pairwise distance that partitions the inter-group and intra-group distances. Hierarchical clustering maps based on average linkage on Euclidean distance were constructed in R using “ggplots” library and ward.D2 method. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Unless otherwise stated, a value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Diversity metrics viz. Shannon, Chao1, observed OTU, and phylogenetic diversity indices demonstrated varying but similar trend for higher microbiome diversity in MD vs. WD consumers (Figure
1; Supplementary Figure S1). Chao1 index, observed species and phylogenetic diversity were insignificantly higher in MD group compared with WD group; while the Shannon Diversity index, which constitutes both microbial richness and abundance, was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) higher in MD vs. WD consumers (Figure
1).

The two diet groups also exhibited differences in the abundance of several species belonging to these genera (Supplementary Table S1), among which Lactobacillus species demonstrated the most prominent difference (Figure
3C). Although L. salivarius represented the most abundant Lactobacillus species, the abundance of all of the Lactobacillus species detected was higher in MD compared to WD group (Figure
3C).

The gut of NHPs is inhabited by a complex and dynamic bacterial community and the compositional as well as functional array of this community can be influenced by various intrinsic and extrinsic elements such as host diet, physiology, geography, and clinical health [29]. The gut microbiome of NHPs has been found to be more similar to those of human primates than to other animals [30]. For instance, the human gut is inhabited by microorganisms belonging to nine different divisions of Bacteria: Firmicutes and Bacteroides (the predominant and most abundant), Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, Spirochaetes and VadinBE97 [31, 32]. In the present study, we identified Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, (the most abundant), Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Fibrobacteres, Cyanobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Tenericutes as the top nine bacterial phyla in these NHPs. Hence, investigation of microbes dwelling in the gastrointestinal tract of these NHPs might provide important clues about the characteristics of these bacterial groups in the human gut. It is also likely that the microbiome composition of these captive monkeys is more humanized than that of wild free-living NHPs consuming more native diets due to the human-like diets they were fed [33].

In summary, the differences observed here in the gut microbiome of NHPs consuming either a Western or Mediterranean diet suggest that this model will be useful in further studies aimed at understanding the diet-microbiome-health interactions in primates.
