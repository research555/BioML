Dynamic distribution of gut microbiota in meat rabbits at different growth stages and relationship with average daily gain (ADG)

The mammalian intestinal tract harbors diverse and dynamic microbial communities that play pivotal roles in host health, metabolism, immunity, and development. Average daily gain (ADG) is an important growth trait in meat rabbit industry. The effects of gut microbiota on ADG in meat rabbits are still unknown.

In this study, we investigated the dynamic distribution of gut microbiota in commercial Ira rabbits from weaning to finishing and uncover the relationship between the microbiota and average daily gain (ADG) via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results indicated that the richness and diversity of gut microbiota significantly increased with age. Gut microbial structure was less variable among finishing rabbits than among weaning rabbits. The relative abundances of the dominant phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia and Cyanobacteria, and the 15 predominant genera significantly varied with age. Metagenomic prediction analysis showed that both KOs and KEGG pathways related to the metabolism of monosaccharides and vitamins were enriched in the weaning rabbits, while those related to the metabolism of amino acids and polysaccharides were more abundant in the finishing rabbits. We identified 34 OTUs, 125 KOs, and 25 KEGG pathways that were significantly associated with ADG. OTUs annotation suggested that butyrate producing bacteria belong to the family Ruminococcaceae and Bacteroidales_S24-7_group were positively associated with ADG. Conversely, Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, and opportunistic pathogens were negatively associated with ADG. Both KOs and KEGG pathways correlated with the metabolism of vitamins, basic amino acids, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) showed positive correlations with ADG, while those correlated with aromatic amino acids metabolism and immune response exhibited negative correlations with ADG. In addition, our results suggested that 10.42% of the variation in weaning weight could be explained by the gut microbiome.

Our findings give a glimpse into the dynamic shifts in gut microbiota of meat rabbits and provide a theoretical basis for gut microbiota modulation to improve ADG in the meat rabbit industry.

The mammalian intestinal tract harbors large and diverse microbial communities. Due to mutualistic relationships, gut microbiota play crucial roles in host health, metabolism, immunity, and development [1, 2]. Moreover, gut microbiota are dynamic and vary according to many factors, including diet, age, host phylogeny, and gut morphology [3].

In this study, we investigated the dynamic distribution of gut microbiota in commercial Ira rabbits from weaning to finishing via high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, we identified microbial taxa and potential functional capacities associated with ADG. Our results not only highlight the shifts and differences of gut microbial communities in meat rabbits at different growth stages, but also provide important information for improving ADG by modulating gut microbiota.

The 16S rRNA gene sequencing process generated a total of 30,080,332 paired-end reads in both weaning and finishing samples. After sequences filtering steps and chimera removal, a total of 29,742,985 high-quality reads were obtained (15,380,901 clean reads of weaning samples, 14,362,084 clean reads of finishing samples). Based on 97% sequences identity, 1460 and 1586 OTUs were obtained from samples at weaning and finishing, respectively. A total of 2072 OTUs were identified from all samples, with 974 of those defined as core OTUs due to their existence in both weaning and finishing samples (Additional file 1: Fig. S1a). Additionally, 486 OTUs were uniquely identified in weaning samples and 612 unique OTUs were found in finishing samples.

PCoA was performed to uncover the changes in gut microbial community structures in weaning and finishing samples. Both the unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances indicated that the samples were clustered by age (Fig.
1c, Additional file 1: Fig. S1c). Besides, the unweighted and weighted UniFrac distance metric comparison analysis further revealed less variation in the gut microbiota among finishing samples than among weaning samples (Fig.
1d, Additional file 1: Fig. S1d, FDR adjusted p < 0.0001).

Gut microbial community composition was analyzed at the phylum and genus level. A total of 10 phyla were shared by weaning and finishing samples, including Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes, Lentisphaerae, Proteobacteria, Saccharibacteria, Tenericutes, and Verrucomicrobia (Additional file 1: Fig. S2a). In addition, Synergistetes and Planctomycetes were uniquely found in weaning and finishing samples, respectively. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Tenericutes were the top six phyla in all samples and they comprised more than 99% of the total sequences (Fig. 2a). Among these, four phyla showed significant differences in relative abundances between weaning and finishing samples (Fig.
2a, Additional file 2: Table S2). The relative abundance of Firmicutes significantly increased from weaning (55.38%) to finishing (75.85%). Conversely, a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was observed from weaning (33.39%) to finishing (17.65%). Moreover, weaning samples exhibited a significantly higher abundance of Verrucomicrobia than finishing samples did (8.62% vs. 2.22%, respectively), while finishing samples exhibited a significantly higher abundance of Cyanobacteria than weaning samples did (1.41% vs. 0.82%, respectively).

At the genus level, a total of 87 genera were identified in all samples, including 54 common genera, 24 genera unique to weaning samples, and 9 genera specific to finishing samples (Additional file 1: Figure. S2b). The 18 most abundant genera found in both weaning and finishing samples were Akkermansia, Alistipes, Bacteroides, Blautia, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, Lachnospiraceae_ NK4A136_group, Lachnospiracea_NK4B4_group, Parabacteroides, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminiclostridium_6, Ruminiclostridium_9, Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, Ruminococcaceae _UCG-010, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, Ruminococcaceae_V9D2013_group, Ruminococcus_1, and Tyzzerella_3 (Fig.
2b). Akkermansia belongs to the phylum Verrucomicrobia, Alistipes, Bacteroides, and Parabacteroides are members of the phylum Bacteroidetes, and the other 14 genera derive from phylum Firmicutes. Among these genera, the relative abundances of 15 were significantly changed from weaning to finishing (Additional file 2: Table S2). Similar to the dynamic changes in the relative abundances of the dominant phyla, we found that the relative abundances of Akkermansia, Alistipes, Bacteroides, and Parabacteroides significantly declined from weaning to finishing, while the relative abundances of most genera (e.g., Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010, Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, and Ruminococcaceae _V9D2013_group) of the phylum Firmicutes significantly increased from weaning to finishing.

To investigate the changes in gut microbial functional profiles of weaning and finishing samples, KOs and KEGG pathways were predicted based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing data using Tax4Fun. We identified 6367 common KOs in all samples, while 41 KOs were specific to weaning samples and 137 KOs were unique to finishing samples (Additional file 1: Fig. S3a). In total, 177 KEGG pathways were identified and shared by both weaning and finishing samples (Additional file 1: Fig. S3b). To identify different enrichment of functional capacities between weaning and finishing samples, we performed a LEfSe analysis using the relative abundances of common KOs and pathways. As shown in Fig. 3a (and Additional file 2: Table S3), 88 KOs showed distinct relative abundances between weaning and finishing samples. Thirty-eight KOs enriched in the weaning samples were mostly related to membrane transporters (e.g., K16091, K11934, K03444, K07221, K02014, and K05306), fructose and mannose metabolism (e.g., K05305, K00895, and K01993) and vitamins metabolism (e.g., K09516, K00699, and K00652). Meanwhile, 50 KOs showing higher abundances in the finishing samples were mostly correlated with the metabolism of amino acids (e.g., K00270, K00263, K00613, K10219, and K05714), lipids (e.g., K06118, K05898, K15868, and K16051), polysaccharides (e.g., K05351, K01452, and K01210), and energy (e.g., K02288, K02290, and K02381). Additionally, we identified 83 KEGG pathways differentially enriched in weaning and finishing samples (Fig.
3b, Additional file 2: Table S3). Similarly, KEGG pathways related to the metabolism of glycan (e.g., glycosaminoglycan and other glycan degradation), monosaccharides (e.g., fructose, mannose, and galactose metabolism), vitamins (e.g., lipoic acid and biotin metaboilsm) were more abundant in weaning samples, while KEGG pathways related to the metabolism of amino acids (e.g., cysteine, methionine, arginine and proline metabolism) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (e.g., butanoate mand propanoate metabolism) were enriched in finishing samples.

To identify microbial taxa associated with ADG, we performed the two-part model analysis using the ADG phenotypic values adjusted for sex and cage effects, and the relative abundances of OTUs in finishing samples. A total of 34 OTUs were identified that exhibited significant associations with ADG. Among these OTUs, 18 were positively associated with ADG and 16 had negative associations with ADG. We annotated these OTUs to microbial taxa using the SILVA database (Fig. 4, Additional file 2: Table S4), the phylogenetic relationships and abundances of these OTUs were shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S4 and Fig. S5.

To identify potential functional capacities correlated with ADG, Spearman correlation analysis was performed for the relative abundances of KEGG items and ADG phenotypic values. As shown in Fig. 5a (and Additional file 2: Table S5), 125 KOs were significantly correlated with ADG (FDR adjusted p < 0.05, |r| > 0.4). Sixty-nine of 125 KOs showed positive correlations with ADG. Most of these KOs were related to the metabolism of vitamins (e.g., K00207, K02822, K08682, K03475, K08351, K02169, K01598), basic amino acids (e.g., K01663, K00933, K01476, K12251, K03897, K01585, K01843, K04486), and SCFAs (e.g., K00175, K00246, K00174, K00929, K00634, K08325, K00239). Meanwhile, the other 56 KOs that exhibited negative correlations with ADG were mostly associated with lipid metabolism (e.g., K01054, K00507, K01897, K06122, K07406, K00865, K06118), aromatic and non-protein amino acids metabolism (e.g., K00495, K01775, K04073, K02618, K01424, K05350, K00588), and immune responses (e.g., K03671, K03462, K04079). In addition, we identified 25 KEGG pathways showed significant correlations with ADG at |r| > 0.4 and FDR adjusted p < 0.05 (Fig.
5b, Additional file 2: Table S5). Among these, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, biotin metabolism, lysine degradation, arginine and proline metabolism, butanoate metabolism, propanoate metabolism, and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism were positively correlated with ADG, while NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, D-Alanine metabolism, antigen processing and presentation, cyanoamino acid metabolism, PPAR signaling pathway, phenylalanine metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, and D-Glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism were negatively associated with ADG.

To estimate what proportion of variation in ADG could be explained by the microbiome, we performed 100 times cross-validation analyses at different p value thresholds (ranging from 10− 4 to 0.1). As shown in Fig. 6, we found that the OTUs identified at p = 1.0 × 10− 4 could explain 5.83% of the variations in ADG. At p = 0.1, the gut microbiome explained 10.42% of the variations in ADG, given that more OTUs were included in the analysis as the threshold increased.

Recently, investigations into mammalian gut microbiota have revealed its vital role in host metabolism, physiology, and immunology. However, few reports have been published on the dynamic distributions of gut microbiota at different growth stages of commercial meat rabbits. ADG is an important growth trait, which is inevitably related to growth stage, but the relation between the gut microbiota and ADG in commercial meat rabbits is still elusive. In the present study, we analyzed the gut microbial diversities and abundances of Ira rabbits at weaning and finishing age. The potential functional profiles of gut microbial communities were then predicted and compared between weaning and finishing rabbits. In addition, we identified microbial taxa and functional capacities associated with ADG.

Additionally, we found that the gut microbiome could explain 5.83–10.42% (Fig.
6) of the variation in ADG that effects similar to host genetics on ADG (5.2–9.6%) [73]. This result implies that the effects of gut microbiota should not be underestimated in attempts to improve growth performances of meat rabbits.

Our study characterized the gut microbiota profiles of weaning and finishing Ira rabbits. Gut microbial richness and diversity increased with age. Significant differences in gut microbial structure were observed between weaning and finishing rabbits. Dynamic shifts in microbial taxa at the phylum and genus level were uncovered between weaning and finishing rabbits. The metagenomic predicted KOs and KEGG pathways exhibited differential enrichment in weaning and finishing rabbits. Our results emphasized the importance of both butyrate producing bacteria and gut microbiota that modulate the metabolism of vitamins, basic amino acids, and SCFAs in promoting the ADG of meat rabbits. In addition, we found that gut microbiome had a similar effect size on ADG as host genetics. Taken together, our results improve our comprehensive understanding of the dynamic distributions of gut microbial communities in meat rabbits, and offer a direction for gut microbiota modulation to improve ADG in the meat rabbit industry.

ADG is a complex quantitative trait [74], therefore, a total of 105 Ira rabbits (53 males and 52 females) were used in the present study derived from Laidewang Animal Husbandry Co., Ltd., Sanming, China. Six to eight pup rabbits per cage were raised with their dam under natural light and room temperature in the same commercial farm. A commercial pellet diet (details are shown in Additional file 2: Table S1) was provided to lactating dams twice a day and pup rabbits had free access to the feed. Pup rabbits were weaned at 28 ± 2 days, at which point one or two rabbits were randomly selected from 90 cages to measure weaning body weight. Hard fecal samples were collected by stimulating the anus. To reduce the effect of differences in initial body weight, 105 rabbits had similar weaning weight (0.9 ± 0.06 kg) were selected and randomly assigned to separate cages (one rabbit per cage) and fed with a fattening diet (details are shown in Table S1) until finishing (72 ± 2 days). Finishing body weight was measured to calculate ADG and hard fecal samples were collected. All rabbits were healthy and had not received antibiotics, anticoccidial drugs, probiotics or prebiotics during experimental period. All fecal samples were dipped into liquid nitrogen for transportation and stored at − 80 °C in the laboratory. At the end of experiments, all rabbits were transported to the local slaughterhouse, stunned with electronarcosis (80 V for 10 s) and quickly bled by cutting the jugular veins and carotid arteries. To avoid the effect of artificial bias, the authors were not involved in the processes of rabbits’ selection, grouping, body weight measurement, and further 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Microbial genomic DNA was extracted from feces using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Before PCR amplification and sequencing, we assessed the purity and integrity of total DNA by using the Nanodrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively.

The V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by the barcoded fusion primers 341F (5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′) and 806R (5′- GGACTACHVGGGTATCTAAT-3′). The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 28 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products purification was performed using the Agencourt AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). The final DNA libraries were sequenced on a Hiseq-2500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Quality control of raw data was performed using QIIME (v.1.9.1), including the removal of the primers, barcodes, and low quality sequences [75]. FLASH (v.1.2.11) was used to merge high-quality paired-end reads into tags [76]. To normalize the sequencing depth, we rarefied the library size of microbial sequences to 40,000 tags per sample before further analysis [77]. Tags were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% sequence identity using USEARCH (v.10.0) [78]. We filtered out those OTUs with relative abundance < 0.1% and those that were presented in less than 3% of the experimental rabbits from further analysis. The SILVA database (v.132) was used to assign taxonomic category to OTUs [79]. The alpha and beta diversity indices were calculated using Mothur (v.1.41.1) and QIIME (v.1.9.1), respectively [75, 80]. Potential functional capacities of gut microbiota were predicted using Tax4Fun [81].

Wilcoxon test with false discovery rate (FDR) correction was used to determine differences in observed species, Shannon, Good’s coverage, weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance metric between weaning and finishing rabbits. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed using both unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances. The dynamic changes in the relative abundances of microbiota at the phylum and genus level were presented as alluvial diagrams. The numbers of shared OTUs, phyla, genera, KOs, and KEGG pathways were showed as the Venn diagrams. Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) was used to analyze the differential enrichment of KOs and KEGG pathways in weaning and finishing samples.

To investigate the contribution of the gut microbiome to the variation in ADG, a 100 × cross-validation was performed as described by Fu et al. [84]. We randomly divided the dataset into an 80% discovery dataset and a 20% validation dataset. In the discovery dataset, the two-part model association analysis was performed to identify a number of (n) OTUs that were significantly associated with phenotype at a certain p value and assessed the effect sizes of binary and quantitative features (β1 and β2) of each OTUs. In the validation dataset, the effect of gut microbiome on ADG (rm) for each individual was estimated by an additive model: rm =
∑
n
j=1
(
β

)
, where bj and qj represents the binary and quantitative feature of j OTU, respectively. We calculated the squared correlation coefficient (R2) between rm and the phenotypic value (corrected for sex and cage), which represents the phenotypic variance explained by the gut microbiome. We repeated the cross-validation for 100 times and calculated the average value of the explained variations to ensure validity and stability of the estimation.
