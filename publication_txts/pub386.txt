Differences in the composition and predicted functions of the intestinal microbiome of obese and normal weight adult dogs





Obesity is a multifactorial nutritional disorder highly prevalent in dogs, observed in developed and developing countries. It is estimated that over 40% of the canine population suffers from obesity, which manifests in an increased risk of chronic osteoarticular, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases. The intestinal microbiome of obese animals shows increases in the abundance of certain members capable of extracting energy from complex polysaccharides. The objective of this study was to compare the composition and predicted function of the intestinal microbiome of Chilean obese and normal weight adult dogs. Twenty clinically healthy dogs were classified according to their body condition score (BCS) as obese (n = 10) or normal weight (n = 10). DNA was extracted from stool samples, followed by next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA V3–V4 region and bioinformatics analysis targeting microbiome composition and function. Significant differences were observed between these groups at the phylum level, with anincrease in Firmicutes and a decrease in Bacteroidetes in obese dogs. Microbiome compositions of these animals correlated with their BCS, and obese dogs showed enrichment in pathways related to transport, chemotaxis, and flagellar assembly. These results highlight the differences in the gut microbiome between normal weight and obese dogs and prompt further research to improve animal health by modulating the gut microbiome.

The gut microbiome represents an extensive catalog of microorganisms residing in the gut of animals (Marchesi & Ravel, 2015). Its composition is usually dominated by bacteria, with contributions of fungi, protozoa, and viruses (Vemuri et al., 2020). The gut microbiome has been directly or indirectly associated with host health in humans and other mammals such as dogs (Suchodolski, 2011; Alessandri et al., 2019). It has an impact on gut homeostasis, host metabolism, nutrient absorption, immune responses, and neurodevelopment, among others (Suchodolski et al., 2012; Heintz-Buschart & Wilmes, 2018; Alessandri et al., 2020; Siddiqui, Akbar & Khan, 2021).

The energy balance in animals is at a delicate equilibrium between energy consumption and expenditure (Stubbs & Tolkamp, 2006). The gut microbiota mediates changes in energy storage, in some cases leading to pathophysiological consequences in the short, medium, or long term (Ley et al., 2006). Few studies have addressed the impact of obesity in the canine gut microbiota, and the microbiome functions that could be altered in these animals are not well known. The goal of this study was to compare the composition of the intestinal microbiota in a group of obese and normal-weight dogs and predict what metabolic functions could be enriched or reduced in their microbiomes.

This study was approved by the Bioethics Committee at the Veterinary Clinic Los Avellanos (Approval Certificate HCVLA-008). The study was performed at the same clinic, located in Independencia, Santiago, Metropolitan Region, Chile. Samples were collected during November 2020. Twenty dogs aged between 2 and 8 years old were sampled (Table S1). Animals were of any breed or sex and fed commercial diets (pellets) from different brands (Table S2). Inclusion criteria were for individuals who presented a normal clinical examination, physiological parameters (temperature, heart, and breathing rate), and no signs of gastrointestinal disease. Animals did not receive antibiotics or probiotics at least three months before the beginning of the study. All dogs had been spayed or neutered before the study.

All dogs were subjected to a complete clinic examination by a veterinarian. According to their body condition, ten normal weight dogs and ten obese dogs were enrolled. The body condition score (BCS) was determined based on a nine-point scale (German et al., 2009; Chun et al., 2019), based on palpation and visual inspection of the ribs, waist, bony prominences, the base of the tail, and abdomen. A one-unit increase in BCS corresponds to an approximate 10% increase in body weight (German et al., 2009; Chun et al., 2019). Animals with BCS values between 4–5 were considered normal weight, and dogs with BCS 8–9 were considered obese. Information regarding breed, age, and sex was obtained directly from each owner (Table 1).

Notes.



Stool samples were collected immediately after defecation and stored at −80 °C until processing. After thawed, 150 mg of each sample were used for total DNA extraction (Quick-DNA Fecal/Soil Microbe Miniprep Kit, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) using a Disruptor Genie device (Scientific Industries, USA). Fecal DNA samples were diluted to 20 ng/µl in nuclease-free water (NanoDrop 2000c; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA ). DNA samples were submitted for Illumina MiSeq sequencing to the DNA Sequencing Services at Molecular Research (MR-DNA, USA). The variable region of the 16S rRNA V3–V4 gene was amplified using primers 341F and 785R (Klindworth et al., 2013), adding a barcode in the forward primer. The reaction was run for 30 cycles using the HotStarTaq Plus Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). After amplification, the PCR products were verified on a 2% agarose gel. Several samples were pooled and purified using calibrated Ampure XP microspheres (Agencourt Bioscience Corporation, Beverly, MA, USA). The pooled and purified pooled PCR products were used to prepare a DNA library using the TruSeq DNA LT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was performed using the MiSeq platform (Illumina, USA).

The raw DNA sequences provided by the external service were analyzed employing the QIIME version 1.8.0 open-source bioinformatics tool (Caporaso et al., 2010). Each sequence sample was demultiplexed into individual files, and barcodes were removed from the 5′-end of each read (via demultiplex_fasta.py script). The processed sequences were uploaded to the European Nucleotide Archive under the project code PRJEB38793. Individual reads were assigned to bacterial taxonomy employing the DADA2 v1.10 R package (Callahan et al., 2016), following a modified procedure. Briefly, sequences were quality-filtered to remove undetermined base callings and trimmed down to 220 nucleotides before estimating the sequencing error model. The model was used to infer Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV) (Callahan, McMurdie & Holmes, 2017) and those variants used to assign bacterial taxonomy with a Naïve Bayesian classifier (Wang et al., 2007) and the SILVA database version 132 (Quast et al., 2013; Yilmaz et al., 2014). The ASV abundance table was utilized to infer the abundance of metabolic functions and pathways with the PICRUSt2 python package (Douglas et al., 2020). Briefly, the PICRUSt2 software reconstructs a metabolism, first aligning an ASV to a reference tree that allows the selection of a reference genome and prediction of the gene content per ASV. Then, PICRUSt2 infers the abundance of metabolic functions and pathways employing the abundance of each ASV in a sample and the selected reference genome. Microbiome composition at the phylum level was assessed with the Shannon diversity index and the weighted UniFrac method (Lozupone et al., 2011) employing the scikit-bio python package (http://scikit-bio.org/). The weighted UniFrac was statistically assessed employing ANOSIM and PERMANOVA, using the scikit-bio software. Univariate analyses of the differences in the relative abundance of phyla, family, and genera were assessed with the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test (Mann & Whitney, 1947) and the DESeq2 R package (Lin & Peddada, 2020). Finally, multivariate analysis of the differences in the abundance of taxa, metabolic functions, and pathways was assessed with the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Effect Size (LEfSe) method (Segata et al., 2011). The LefSe method was performed employing the Galaxy server (Afgan et al., 2018) at https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/). In the case of the metabolic functions, the abundance of the KEGG orthologs (KO) and KEGG pathways were clustered and analyzed in a sample basis, and later, the contribution of each taxon at the genus levels and treatment was assessed only for the significant effect sizes of LDA (absolute value of the log10 LDA greater than 2) employing the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Significance level for all statistical analysis was p-value <0.05.

This work analyzed the gut microbiome of ten obese (O) and ten normal (N) weight dogs, according to their BCS. The characteristics of the animals are presented in Table 1. Both groups were statistically similar in age and weight (Mann–Whitney U-test p ≈ 0.14 and p ≈ 0.09, respectively).

To detail the individual contribution of any microorganism to enriched or depleted metabolic pathways, the LEfSE analysis of the abundance of the KEGG orthologs at the phylum level was performed (Fig. 4C). The analysis revealed that the higher relative abundance of Firmicutes in obese dogs contributed to increases in chemotaxis proteins (p-value ≈ 0.005), hexosaminidase activity (p-value ≈ 0.016), and fumarate reductase activity (p-value ≈ 0.0005). These processes are related to respiration, motility, and degradation of host glycans. In addition, the analysis revealed that Bacteroidetes abundance in normal weight animals was responsible for the abundance of sensor histidine kinase function in obese dogs (p-value ≈ 0.003) and to hexosaminidase activity in normal weight dogs (p-value ≈ 0.016). This analysis was also performed at the genus level (Fig. 4D). Anaerobiospirillum, Bacteroides, and Prevotellaceae relative abundance correlated positively with 3 of 4 enriched KEGG orthologs in normal weight dogs (K06142, K00244, K02014; Fig. 4D). Similarly, Caproiciproducens relative abundance correlated positively with 2 of 3 identified KEGG orthologs by LEfSe in obese dogs (K03406, K00936; Fig. 4E). On the contrary, Allobaculum, Alloprevotella, Lactobacillus, Negativibacillus, and Ruminococcaceae relative abundance correlated negatively with the abundance of the three identified KEGG orthologs (Fig. 4E).

The gut microbiome has emerged as a factor shaping metabolic responses in animals, including canines (Bermudez Sanchez et al., 2021). In this study, we observed a significant decrease in Bacteroidetes and an increase in Firmicutes in obese dogs (Figs. 2 and
4). Bacteroidetes, together with Firmicutes, is one of the most abundant phyla in the canine intestinal microbiome, both in obese and normal weight dogs. A tendency of Bacteroidetes to decrease and Firmicutes to increase in obese dogs has been observed previously (Suchodolski, 2016). Interestingly, the ratio Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes has been shown to increase in dogs undergoing a high-fat diet accompanied by a reduction in insulin sensitivity and alterations in epithelial permeability (Moinard et al., 2020). This ratio has been shown to decrease in dogs under weight loss or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Barko et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; Bermudez Sanchez et al., 2020; Moinard et al., 2020). Notably, most of these studies have been reported in US and European countries, but only a few in other countries. In general, the evidence indicates a similar trend of increasing the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio in obese animals in different countries (Handl et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017; Montoya-Alonso et al., 2017; Bermudez Sanchez et al., 2020). However, further studies and proper statistical comparisons are required to determine the effect of geography on the gut microbiota and obesity in dogs. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio imbalance has also been observed in obese humans, being reversible after dietary interventions (Ley, Turnbaugh & Klein, 2006). While obesity is a multicomponent disease and dogs were classified as obese according to the BCS score, additional analysis, including measurements of fat percentage and metabolic markers would improve the power of these correlations.

In this study, we predicted the enrichment of KEGG orthologs K03406 and K07483 in the obese group. Previously, other authors have identified these genes in dogs with diarrhea compared with a healthy group (Guard et al., 2015). These genes, which code for methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein and transposases, are related to the formation of biofilms, biosynthesis of flagella, production of exopolysaccharides and toxins, among others. These changes are likely a reflection of the enrichment in pro-inflammatory, flagellated bacteria in the gut of obese animals, contributing to their obese phenotype (Salah Ud-Din & Roujeinikova, 2017).

Obesity is a multifactorial disease highly prevalent in dogs. In this study, we compared the gut microbiome of normal weight and obese dogs. Their microbiome compositions were observed to be different. At the phylum level, obese animals showed an increase in Firmicutes (Blautia, Peptoclostridium) and a decrese in Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides spp). An increase in pathways related to motility and chemotaxis was observed in obese animals, which could contribute to their phenotype. It is essential to understand the contribution of specific microbiome taxa and their metabolic activities to obesity in dogs and how this information could be used in combination with diet to manage this disease.
