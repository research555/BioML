Structural diversity, functional aspects and future therapeutic applications of human gut microbiome

The research on human gut microbiome, regarded as the black box of the human body, is still at the stage of infancy as the functional properties of the complex gut microbiome have not yet been understood. Ongoing metagenomic studies have deciphered that the predominant microbial communities belong to eubacterial phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and archaebacterial phylum Euryarchaeota. The indigenous commensal microbial flora prevents opportunistic pathogenic infection and play undeniable roles in digestion, metabolite and signaling molecule production and controlling host’s cellular health, immunity and neuropsychiatric behavior. Besides maintaining intestinal health via short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, gut microbes also aid in neuro-immuno-endocrine modulatory molecule production, immune cell differentiation and glucose and lipid metabolism. Interdependence of diet and intestinal microbial diversity suggests the effectiveness of pre- and pro-biotics in maintenance of gut and systemic health. Several companies worldwide have started potentially exploiting the microbial contribution to human health and have translated their use in disease management and therapeutic applications. The present review discusses the vast diversity of microorganisms playing intricate roles in human metabolism. The contribution of the intestinal microbiota to regulate systemic activities including gut–brain–immunity crosstalk has been focused. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first of its kind to collate and discuss the companies worldwide translating the multi-therapeutic potential of human intestinal microbiota, based on the multi-omics studies, i.e. metagenomics and metabolomics, as ready solutions for several metabolic and systemic disorders.



Human gut microbiome refers to the total microbial population in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) that includes bacteria and other microorganisms. The human body is the host to approximately 500–1000 species of gut microbes that encode 100-fold more unique genes than the host human genome (Ley et al. 2006). The huge diversity of gut microbiota remained unknown until culture independent high-throughput sequencing technology and powerful analytical and bioinformatics tools were developed. With the development and advancement of next generation sequencing technology, the long unexplored black box of the human body, i.e. the gut microbiome came into light and a deeper understanding of the same was designated as the second human genome (Mosca et al. 2016). Although the first one is inherited from the parents of an individual and is highly stable, the second genome is adapted from the environment after birth and remains continuously dynamic (D’Argenio and Salvatore 2015). The second genome, i.e. the acquired microbiome is therefore, highly dependent and subject to change upon several environmental factors, such as i) host genotype and ethnicity, ii) age and sex, iii) diet, iv) hormonal cycles, v) illness and therapies, and vi) travel history. Establishment of a microbial community is therefore, consequent to varied range of ecological interactions classified under five different heads: i) mutualism—beneficial interaction for both the partners), ii) amensalism—one impacts the other negatively, iii) commensalism—one impacts the other positively, iv) competition—both the competitors harm each other, v) predation and parasitism—one gets benefitted out of the other (Faust and Raes 2012; Mosca et al. 2016).

In view of the existing knowledge on gut microbiome the present review discusses an integrated approach to understand the diversity of the complex black box of our body and the specific roles of particular bacterial taxa related to human metabolism under varying environmental or physiological conditions. It further discusses as to how the extraordinarily diverse microbial community participates in the functioning of innate and adaptive immune responses and is also involved in the crosstalk with central nervous system where brain commands several gut functions like mucin production, peristalsis and gut immune functions. The potential use of gut microbiota by several start-up companies for therapeutic applications and commercialization is also discussed.

Microbial colonization on the human body starts immediately following birth and the community composition is shaped by various environmental factors. Various molecular techniques have been employed to analyze the microbial diversity and abundances (Table
1). The infant gut microbiota is majorly predominated by members of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and the abundance of the phylum detected are according to the order of their appearance. However, in adults, the abundance shifts to Firmicutes followed by the members of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Although members of Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Verrucomicrobia are present in adults, but are less represented (Eckburg 2005; Ley et al. 2006; Winston and Theriot 2020; Zhernakova et al. 2016). Trillions of bacteria belonging to thousands of different species majorly fall under the above mentioned phyla (D’Argenio and Salvatore 2015; Li et al. 2008). Human metabolic phenotypes are found to be modulated by the symbiotic intestinal gut microbiome. Moreover, their ratio of abundance might act as biomarkers indicating sex, age or diseased conditions. Li et al. (2008) in their study showed that a low ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes correlate with obesity and could be elevated by restricting the dietary calorific intake.

A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on the 16S rRNA sequences of all the microbial species detected in human gut microbiome has been constructed which reflects that the predominant phyla are Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroides and Actinobacteria in eubacterial group and Euryarchaeota in the archaeal group (Fig. 2). Other phyla are moderately to sparsely represented.



The extraordinarily diverse and complex microbial community of gut microbiome has been found to participate in maturation and functioning of innate as well as adaptive immunity (Cénit et al. 2014; Cheng et al. 2019). The diverse microbial flora also plays important role in host defense against pathogens by repairing intestinal mucosal damage, production of various anti-microbial peptides and induction of secretion of interleukins IL-22, IL-17 and, IL-10 by host immune cells.

The adaptive immune response required for local and systemic homeostasis is highly regulated by the diverse composition of gut microbiota. Gut harbors an environment where continuous presence of microbes imposes a selective pressure on the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) to undergo dynamic remodeling. Intestinal CD4 + T cells present on the lamina propria of intestine are the key component of adaptive immunity which can differentiate into four major subtypes, i.e. T helper 1 cells (Th1), Th2, Th17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells, The characteristics and roles of different subtypes of T cells have been summarized in Table
4 (Wu and Wu 2012). Gut microbiota plays a major role in T cell differentiation, e.g. the polysaccharide A molecule of Bacteroides fragilis induces systemic Th1 response. Segmented Filamentous Bacteria (SFBs) influence TH17 cell differentiation through pro-inflammatory response and Th1 cells to a lesser extent. Overexpression of Th17 response may lead to auto-immune diseases. Clostridia spp. belonging to clusters XIVa and IV were found to be associated with IL-10 producing Treg cells (Atarashi et al. 2011).

The gut-brain axis is an integrated communication system that involves afferent and efferent neural, endocrine/hormonal, nutrient and immunological signals for the crosstalk of the gut microbiota and its metabolites with the central nervous system. It is a bidirectional communication system where in response to the gut microbial environment and its metabolite signaling, brain commands several gut functions, such as mucin production, peristalsis and gut immune functions. Factors, such as stress, variations in diet (Buffington et al. 2016), immune activation (Estes and McAllister 2016; Foley et al. 2014) and alterations in maternal microbiome during pregnancy due to use of antibiotics or probiotics (Russell et al. 2013; Tochitani et al. 2016), can modulate the microbiome, neurodevelopment and behavior of an individual (Baumgart and Carding 2007; Borre et al. 2014; Bull and Plummer 2014; Silva et al. 2020). Gut pathologies increase permeability of the intestinal barrier which leads to increase in translocation of bacterial products that can in turn, enhance the production of cytokines and impact the blood brain barrier (BBB). This leads to even more serious ill effects. Moreover, it is well documented that levels of several neurotransmitters are regulated by the gut microbes. These microbes have even been found to directly synthesize or modulate the synthesis of various other neurotransmitters like g-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) (Calvani et al. 2018; Fung et al. 2017; Sherwin et al. 2018) which can potentially influence microglial activation and several cerebral functions. Signal transducers, such as enterochromaffin cells can bind several microbial metabolites, secrete serotonin increasing its concentration in both blood and colon. Among other transducers are vagus nerve signaling involved in mediating satiety, stress and mood and microbial metabolites, such as SCFAs, the variation of which have shown various neuropathologies (Silva et al. 2020). There are speculations that SCFAs might have roles in the production of GLP-1, PYY and other gut hormones, such as 5-HT, GIP, ghrelin and CKK.

The microbiome-gut-brain axis involves multidirectional communication which includes metabolic, endocrine, neural and immune pathways (Joscelyn and Kasper 2014; Wang and Kasper 2014). The intrinsic nervous system of the GI tract is known as the enteric nervous system (ENS) and is a part of the autonomic nervous system. Due to its huge extent, degree of autonomy and capability to control gastric functions, such as absorption, secretions, integrity, proliferation, barrier function and defense alarm system in concert with CNS, it is also known as the ‘second brain’. Enteric neurons have been known to be activated by various bacterial toxins and metabolites, e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus- (strain JB-1) and B. fragilis-specific polysaccharide A (PSA) activates intestinal primary afferent neurons of the ENS in mice (Ochoa-Repáraz and Kasper 2016). Gut commensals including E. coli have also been documented to show symbiotic host-microbiota relationships via production of inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate through phytate metabolism. Besides, inducing growth of human tissue derived intestinal organoids, inositol 1, 4, 5 triphosphate has been shown to stimulate histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)—dependent proliferation and counteract the inhibitory effect of abundantly present butyrate upon colonic growth. Thus, the gut microbiota-derived metabolite inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate has been shown to activate a mammalian HDAC to promote intestinal epithelial repair (Wu et al. 2020).

Several investigators have proposed that the human microbiome should be used as an integral part of precision medicine approach as not only it could contribute to inter-individual variability in diseases but could also be a modifiable factor in terms of development of future therapeutics. Various researchers observed that personalized diets could be created through blood glucose response by integrating parameters, such as dietary habit, physical activity and gut microbiota for lowering blood glucose post-meal (Suez and Elinav 2017; Zeevi et al. 2015). Several promising research findings have documented the link between the gut microbiome, their therapeutic effects and various systemic diseases in recent times. Numerous start-up companies have initiated the translation of the research findings of several investigations on gut microbiome for fruitful therapeutic applications and subsequent commercialization. Companies developing microbiome therapy pipelines use various microbial approaches which include small molecule therapy (31%), e.g. prebiotics supporting growth of a particular group of bacteria of therapeutic importance; development and administration of single strain whole bacteria (26%). Few other approaches, such as application of microbial consortia and genetically modified single strain bacteria (12%) are also adopted. However, with increase in the number of bacterial populations number of factors playing role in cause and effect also increases. The least used approaches are phage cocktail (4%) and microbial ecosystems (4%) which call for several challenges including immune response, microbial succession and change in gut flora composition of an individual.

Today around 200 companies are working across the globe to utilize the therapeutic capacity of the healthy gut microbiome to translate it for public use. Biomica is an emerging company working on microbiome-based therapeutics against immune mediated infectious diseases, immuno-oncology and, gastro-intestinal tract disorders. Finch therapeutics group is another concern that harnesses the gut microbiome. Companies adopting other approaches, i.e. on single strain cell development are A-mansia, BioGaia, Bio-Me, Ginkgo Bioworks, Next Biotix, etc. Others that focus on development of gut microbiome modulating drugs are Vedanta BioSciences, Snipr Biome, Ritter Pharmaceuticals, etc. The use of prebiotics/probiotics has been immensely adopted for the treatment of various gut related diseases affecting metabolism, immune system and CNS. Genetically modified Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is a well-known probiotic or Live Biotherapeutic Products (LBP) which is believed to impede the growth of opportunistic pathogens, including Salmonella spp. and other coliform enteropathogens, through the production of microcin proteins or production of iron-scavenging siderophores. It has been used to treat various gastrointestinal conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome in its unengineered form. Besides, probiotics belonging to diverse genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Lysteria monocytogenes, Bifidobacterium, Staphylococcus, Salmonella typhii, Clostridium and Bacteroidetes have also been engineered to be applied for biotherapeutic purpose to treat various therapeutic indications (Charbonneau et al. 2020). Companies like Acto Bio Therapeutics, Synlogic, Oragenics, Novome Biotechnologies and, CHAIN biotech, etc. are actively involved in bioengineering and production of various lantibiotics, immunomodulators and probiotics to treat systemic and metabolic disorders (Table
5). Several other companies have also worked on novel therapeutics based on small molecules, such as 4D Pharma, VAXIMM, Scioto Biosciences, etc. specially targeted to act as immunomodulators or live biotherapeutics to treat grave diseases as various cancers, neurodegenerative disorders and recurrent C. difficile prevention.

The complex and dynamic population of microorganisms in the human gut and its relationship with human health and disease has been the subject of extensive research in the last two decades. Several research studies have reported that the human gut microbiome contribute immensely in regulating human health including metabolic diseases, neuropsychological disorders and immunological response. Exciting discoveries on targeted roles of microbial communities on host metabolism, increasing knowledge on keystone species relating to particular disease states through high-throughput sequencing data, understanding links between the bacterial activation of host cells through expression of special metabolites and production of host signaling molecules in turn could open up new avenues to treat infectious and chronic diseases in a much healthy and chemical-free manner. Deeper understanding of the roles of gut microbial species in host immune activation and regulation of central nervous system would be highly rewarding in treating several autoimmune diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders which either remain untreated or suffer from various adverse side-effects upon chemical therapy. Researchers worldwide have started utilizing the knowledge excavated from microbiome mining studies into the translational pipeline to treat and prevent various human diseases. However, even deeper insights would be needed to completely unravel the complexity of human gut microbiome or the second genome and realize its enormous potential to serve mankind.
