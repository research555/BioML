Circulating levels of the anti-oxidant indoleproprionic acid are associated with higher gut microbiome diversity

The gut microbiome has recently emerged as an important regulator of insulin resistance and abdominal obesity. The tryptophan metabolite generated by the gut microbiome, indoleproprionic acid (IPA) has been shown to predict the onset of type 2 diabetes. IPA is a metabolite produced by gut microbes from dietary tryptophan that exhibits a high degree of inter-individual variation. The microbiome composition parameters that are associated with circulating levels of this potent anti-oxidant have however not been investigated to date in human populations. In 1018 middle-aged women from the TwinsUK cohort, we assessed the relationship between serum IPA levels and gut microbiome composition targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Microbiome alpha-diversity was positively correlated with serum indoleproprionic acid levels (Shannon Diversity: Beta[95%CI] = 0.19[0.13;0.25], P = 6.41 × 10−10) after adjustment for covariates. Sixteen taxa and 12 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with IPA serum levels. Among these are positive correlations with the butyrate-producing Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the class Mollicutes and the order RF39 of the Tenericutes, and Coprococcus Negative correlations instead were observed with Eubacterium dolichum previously shown to correlate with visceral fat mass and several genera in the Lachnospiraceae family such as Blautia and Ruminococcus previously shown to correlate with obesity. Microbiome composition parameters explained ~20% of the variation in circulating levels of IPA, whereas nutritional and host genetic parameters explained only ~4%. Our data confirm an association between IPA circulating levels and metabolic syndrome parameters and indicate that gut microbiome composition influences IPA levels.

Indoleproprionic acid (IPA) is an antioxidant predictive of a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D).1 Indeed, De Mello et al.1 compared IPA levels in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, some of whom developed T2D over 15 years. Higher IPA levels are associated with reduced likelihood of developing T2D and this was further replicated in a Swedish population.1

We hypothesized that gut microbiome and dietary intake of tryptophan would have the strongest influence on levels of IPA. In this study, we have therefore quantified the contribution of microbiome composition, dietary fiber and tryptophan intake and genetic variation in humans to circulating levels of IPA in a large cohort of twins.

The descriptive characteristics of the study participants are presented in Table 1. One thousand eighteen females with concurrent IPA and microbiome data were included in the analysis.

Finally, we investigated how much the bacterial OTUs independently associated positively and negatively with circulating IPA and the IPA associated taxa reflect visceral fat mass. Visceral fat is not only an important contributor to metabolic syndrome but was the phenotypic trait most strongly associated in our data (Table S1); 9 out of the 12 independent OTUs and 8 out of the 16 IPA associated taxa were also nominally associated with visceral fat mass after adjusting for age, and BMI (Figure 2). In all cases, we found that those associated negatively with IPA were positively correlated with visceral fat whereas those positively correlated with IPA were negatively correlated with visceral fat (Figure 2). Importantly all the bacterial associations with IPA remained statistically significant after adjusting for visceral fat mass but one out nine associations between visceral fat mass and the bacterial OTUs was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for IPA levels (Figure 2).

In this study we have investigated for the first time in humans, the relationship between IPA circulating levels, gut microbiome composition and metabolic health in 1018 women. In our data, we find that IPA is strongly correlated with high microbiome diversity in spite of the fact that only a handful of bacteria strains are known to be able to produce IPA.7 We also confirm that IPA is strongly linked to dietary fiber intake and that higher IPA circulating levels correlate with lower risk of a number of metabolic syndrome parameters as shown by Mello et al.1

Notwithstanding the above limitations, this is the first study to investigate the dietary, genetic and microbiome factors to the circulating levels of this powerful anti-oxidant.

Study subjects were female twins enrolled in the TwinsUK registry, a national register of adult twins recruited as volunteers without selecting for any particular disease or trait traits.12 In this study, we analyzed data from 1018 female twins with concurrent 16s microbiome data and serum metabolomics. The study was approved by NRES Committee London–Westminster, and all twins provided informed written consent.

Microbiome analysis: Faecal samples were collected and the composition of the gut microbiome was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing carried out as previously described.20 Briefly, the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq. Reads were then summarised to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) Quality control was carried out on a per sample basis, discarding paired-ends with an overlap of less than 200nt and removing chimeric sequences using de novo chimera detection in USEARCH.21 De novo OTU clustering was then carried across all reads using Sumaclust within QIIME 1.9.0, grouping reads with a 97% identity threshold.22,23 OTU counts were converted to log-transformed relative abundances, with zero counts handled by the addition of an arbitrary value (10−6). The residuals of the OTU abundances were taken from linear models, accounting for technical covariates including sequencing depth, sequencing run, sequencing technician and sample collection method. These residuals were inverse normalized, as they were not normally distributed, and used in downstream analyses. In order to calculate alpha diversity, the complete OTU count table was rarefied to 10,000 sequences per sample 50 times. Alpha diversity metrics were calculated for each sample in each of the rarefied tables and final diversity measures taken as the mean score across all 50. Alpha diversities were quantified as observed OTU counts and Shannon and Simpson diversity indices. Alpha diversity indexes were standardized to have mean 0 and SD 1.

Statistical analysis was carried out using Stata version 11. We inverse normalized circulating IPA levels as the metabolite concentration was not normally distributed. We imputed missing values using the minimum run-day measures. We assessed the association between the cardio-metabolic trait and circulating levels of IPA by using randomly mixed models adjusting for age, BMI and family relatedness. Linear mixed models were also employed to evaluate the associations between (i) circulating IPA levels and gut microbial diversity (Shannon, Simpson and CHAO1 indexes, number of observed OTUs), (ii) IPA and OTU, and (iii) IPA and taxa adjusting for age, BMI, technical covariates and multiple testing using Bonferroni correction.

Using standard multiple linear regressions, we computed the proportion of the variance (R2) in IPA not explained by age, BMI and MAP that was explained by microbiome diversity, microbiome OTUs, genetics, and diet. Finally, we explored the direction of microbiome associations with IPA and compared them to those between the same microbes and visceral fat, a marker of metabolic syndrome. To do this we first ran linear regressions of the same taxa and OTUs with normalized visceral fat adjusting for age, BMI and technical covariates. We then further adjusted for IPA and ran in parallel the same regressions with IPA as the outcome variable adjusting for visceral fat.
