Microbial biotransformations in the human distal gut

The human distal gut is home to a rich and dense microbial community with representatives of all three domains of life which are intricately connected with our physiology and health. The combined genomes of these microbes, collectively called the human microbiome, vastly expand the metabolic capacities of our own genome, allowing us to break down and extract energy from dietary compounds that human enzymes cannot digest. In addition, the variable composition of these communities and their biotransformations might explain inter‐individual differences in toxicities, tolerances and efficacies for certain drugs. Recent advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics have provided exciting new insights into the genomes of our microbial symbionts, their functional capacities and the interactions between these microbes and their human host. This review summarizes the metabolic conversions of dietary components and pharmaceuticals that take place in the human distal gut, as well as their implications for human health.

The human gut is home to 100 trillion microorganisms, most of which live in the colon, the distal part of the gastrointestinal tract. Collectively, these microbes are called the human gut microbiota or, if also referring to their genomes and the surrounding habitat, the human gut microbiome. The vast majority of these microorganisms are bacterial, although archaeal and fungal species are part of the gut microbiota as well (Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012; Hoffmann et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014). In addition, the intestinal microbiome includes eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages, and although their numbers and diversity are much less well studied and not part of the usual estimate of 100 trillion microbes, they are likely to be present in high numbers as well (Robinson and Pfeiffer, 2014). Other human body sites such as mouth and skin are also colonized with microbes, but their numbers and densities are considerably outnumbered by those living in the distal gastrointestinal tract (Sender et al., 2016).

Here, we will provide a broad overview of the main metabolic processes performed by the human gut microbiota, focusing on dietary and xenobiotic ‘input’ molecules and microbial output molecules that are relevant for the physiology of the host. Many excellent reviews have been written about specific subtopics (Flint et al., 2012; Ursell and Knight, 2013; Koh et al., 2016; Louis and Flint, 2016; Spanogiannopoulos et al., 2016; Stilling et al., 2016; Zhang and Davies, 2016), but we will provide a basic overview of prevalent commensal species and the main metabolic processes they perform.

The human gut microbiome consists of hundreds of microbial species, most of which belong to two bacterial phyla: Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Together, these two bacterial taxa constitute the vast majority of the gut community in stool samples, irrespective of diet or geographical location (Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012; Obregon‐Tito et al., 2015; Falony et al., 2016). Among the Bacteroidetes phylum, Bacteroides and Prevotella are the most abundant and prevalent genera (Table 1). Within Firmicutes, prevalence and abundance is highest for the Blautia, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia and Ruminococcus genera (Falony et al., 2016; Zhernakova et al., 2016). Other less prominent but prevalent phyla are Actinobacteria, to which Bifidobacterium species belong, Fusobacteria (genus Fusobacterium) and Verrucomicrobia (genus Akkermansia). A novel phylum called Melainabacteria, related to Cyanobacteria, have recently been recognized as inhabitants of the human gut (Di Rienzi et al., 2013).

The data shown here are compiled of data provided in a number of reviews (Louis and Flint, 2016; Magnúsdóttir et al., 2017; Desai et al., 2016; Koh et al., 2016; Ze et al., 2015; Blekhman et al., 2015; Reichardt et al., 2014; LeBlanc et al., 2013; Flint et al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2010; Belenguer et al., 2006). Most Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes species are capable of producing vitamin B8, as reported by Magnúsdóttir et al. (2017). Genus and species names shown in bold were reported to have an abundance of over 1% in a cohort of 1135 Dutch individuals (Zhernakova et al., 2016)

Despite these temporal and population differences, patterns of gut microbial composition in health are starting to emerge. A dataset obtained from a healthy subset of nearly 1000 subjects from the uBiome citizen science cohort was used to define normal ranges of 28 microbial taxa (Almonacid et al., 2017).

While human enzymes in the small intestine break down most dietary ingredients such as proteins, starch and fatty acids into absorbable smaller molecules, such as amino acids, and monosaccharides, not all molecules present in the diet can be digested in this part of the gastrointestinal tract. The human genome does not encode for enzymes that break down complex proteins and complex carbohydrates, that is, fibres and other plant‐derived polysaccharides. These molecules will therefore reach the colon largely intact, where they can be digested by the gut microbiome (Flint et al., 2012). In addition, the ability to degrade complex carbohydrates can be driven by the diet of the human population.

In addition to the degradation of polysaccharides, other important functions of the gut microbiome include the synthesis of short‐chain fatty acids (SCFAs), specific lipopolysaccharides and certain vitamins and amino acids (Lloyd‐Price et al., 2016). A recent metabolic genome reconstruction of 773 members of the human gut microbiome genomes found genes encoding for 3200 unique chemical reactions, suggesting that this community encodes for hundreds or even thousands of metabolic pathways (Magnúsdóttir et al., 2017).

The microbiome and metabolic reactions of the human infant gut are distinct from those of the adult gut. Colonization of the infant gut starts immediately after birth, in a process that is thought to involve initial seeding with vaginal and skin microbes derived from the mother, which during the first months of life are gradually replaced with strains derived from other sources, with larger shifts in microbial composition around the time of weaning or around antibiotic treatment (reviewed in Mueller et al., 2015).

When breastfeeding stops and solid foods are introduced, the infant gut microbiota starts a trajectory towards a more adult‐like composition characterized by an increase in the abundance of Bacteroides, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcus (Bäckhed et al., 2015; Mueller et al., 2015). The composition of the infant gut microbiota continues to increasingly resemble that of an adult until it reaches maturation at 3–4 years of age (Yatsunenko et al., 2012).

In the adult gut, undigested dietary fibre, carbohydrates and proteins are fermented and further metabolized by the microbial communities in the caecum and colon (Figure 1). The main end products of the fermentation of complex carbohydrates are SCFAs, such as http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=1058, http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=1062 and http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=1059, and gases, such as CO2, http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=9532 and NH3. SCFAs are volatile fatty acids with one to six carbon atoms in straight or branched‐chain conformations (den Besten et al., 2013; Koh et al., 2016; Ríos‐Covián et al., 2016). In the human colon, acetate (C2), propionate (C3) and butyrate (C4) are the most abundant, collectively accounting for over 90% of SCFAs (Ríos‐Covián et al., 2016). These three compounds are present in the ratio 60:20:20 respectively (den Besten et al., 2013).

When dietary fibre content is low, intestinal microbes will use less favourable nutrient sources such as dietary fats or proteins or even switch to digesting host‐secreted mucins (Desai et al., 2016; Koh et al., 2016). For example, Akkermansia muciniphila ferments host mucins to form propionate (Derrien et al., 2016). Digestion of host mucus glycoproteins can lead to erosion of the colonic mucus barrier, which in turn can lead to increased intestinal permeability and increased vulnerability for infections with pathogens (Desai et al., 2016).

SCFAs produced by the gut microbiota are important molecules that can exert a wide range of functions (Figure 2). The main functions of intestinal SCFAs are to serve as an energy source for intestinal cells, signalling molecules, modulators of water and electrolyte absorption and regulators of lipid metabolism and components of the intestinal immune system (reviewed in, e.g. den Besten et al., 2013; Koh et al., 2016; Louis and Flint, 2016; Ríos‐Covián et al., 2016; Stilling et al., 2016). In addition, SCFAs also modulate electrolyte and water absorption that can have various effects on organs beyond the gut. Therefore, SCFAs are key molecules in the communication between the host and microbiome, and they are believed to play important roles in health (Ríos‐Covián et al., 2016; Stilling et al., 2016).

The relative low amounts of fibre in Western diets as compared to diets of, for example, hunter‐gatherers, are likely to be associated with lower amounts and different types of SCFA. Although in vivo production and absorption of SCFA in humans are hard to measure, model systems have confirmed that caecal SCFA production is strongly dependent on dietary fibre content, and this might have important implications on human health (den Besten et al., 2013).

One of the byproducts formed during the anaerobic degradation of organic matter is hydrogen (H2) which is generated to dispose of reducing equivalents (Nakamura et al., 2010). If the concentration of excess hydrogen in the colon reaches high levels, the fermentation pathways will be inhibited. Thus, the presence of hydrogen‐consuming (hydrogenotrophic) microbes is needed to increase the efficiency of the fermentation process. There are several H2‐consuming members of the human gut microbiome, which can be categorized into three broad groups: acetogens, methanogens and sulfate/sulfite reducers (Nakamura et al., 2010; Rey et al., 2013).

In the complex microbial environment of the human colon, the efficient removal of the hydrogen generated during the fermentation of plant polysaccharides is essential for continuous SCFA production. The presence of both hydrogen‐producers and hydrogen‐consumers is one of the many syntrophic (cross‐feeding) metabolic interactions found in the human gut, with sulfate reduction and methanogenesis the most commonly encountered pathways of hydrogen clearance in the colon (Ríos‐Covián et al., 2016; Stilling et al., 2016).

Another important function of the gut microbiota is the synthesis of essential nutrients such as amino acids and vitamins. These molecules are needed by the human body as a precursor for the synthesis of several enzymes or other compounds but cannot be made by humans themselves. Humans are therefore dependent on the presence of these essential molecules in our diet or supplements or on the capacity of our gut microbiome to synthesize them. Vitamins produced by the gut microbiome include http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=2771 and most of the B‐vitamins (LeBlanc et al., 2013).

Vitamin K (menaquinone) can be produced by the gut microbiota as well. Genes encoding vitamin K biosynthesis pathways were recently found to be present in the genomes of 118 out of 254 gut bacteria, including Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus and Prevotella spp., but whether these bacteria actually produce vitamin K remains to be determined (Ravcheev and Thiele, 2016).

Other than the well‐studied metabolites discussed above, the human gut microbiome generates hundreds of other products, and many of these are thought to play roles in microbial–microbial or microbial–host interactions (Donia and Fischbach, 2015). Although the function of most of these molecules remains unknown as of now, ongoing research will probably uncover many new metabolites with interesting diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Here, we will list some recent discoveries in this field as a foretaste of the exciting possibilities to come.

In contrast to the mostly beneficial gut microbial metabolites discussed above, other microbially synthesized molecules have been implicated in human disease. Dietary http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=4780 (abundant in red meat) and phosphatidylcholine are metabolized by gut microbiota members into http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=5521 (TMA). In the liver, TMA is converted into trimethylamine‐N‐oxide (TMAO), which is involved in atherosclerosis and is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (Koeth et al., 2013; Spanogiannopoulos et al., 2016; Zhang and Davies, 2016). TMAO levels are higher in meat eaters than in vegetarians or vegans, and experiments in animals and human volunteers have suggested that the gut microbiota is likely to be responsible for the link between the consumption of red meat and cardiovascular disease (Koeth et al., 2013). Recently, TMA conversion has been assigned to particular Clostridia and Eubacterium spp. (Rath et al., 2017).

The vast combined array of chemical capabilities allows gut microbes to not only metabolize dietary and host components but also xenobiotics, that is, chemical substances that are not a natural part of an organism or its diet, such as drugs and pollutants. These biotransformations, most often reduction and hydrolysis, can result in three types of changes. They can activate drugs, inactivate drugs or make them more toxic. Currently, at least 50 different drug conversions performed by the human gut microbiota have been described and extensively reviewed (Ursell and Knight, 2013; Klaassen and Cui, 2015; Spanogiannopoulos et al., 2016; Wilson and Nicholson, 2017). Some well‐studied examples will be highlighted here briefly.

The examples listed above are just some of the many microbial conversions of xenobiotics described. Because of the large inter‐individual variations in gut microbial composition, the same compound in the same dose can have a very different effect, with toxicity and efficacy varying from person to person. This microbial contribution in drug metabolism is often overlooked in clinical studies. Knowledge of the composition and metabolic activity of an individual's gut microbiota can be extremely helpful in predicting that individual's response to certain drugs (Ursell and Knight, 2013; Klaassen and Cui, 2015).

This review has provided a broad overview of known biochemical reactions performed by microbes in the human gut and their importance for human physiology. Some important concepts are worth restating here.

Such expected new insights of yet‐to‐be discovered metabolic functions and inter‐individual differences are likely to greatly contribute to the personalized medicine field. In the near future, analysis of a patient's gut microbiome will be an integral part of personal clinical care and pharmaceutical development.
