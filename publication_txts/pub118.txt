Effects of Sevoflurane Inhalation Anesthesia on the Intestinal Microbiome in Mice



In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to intestinal microbiome. Almost all operations will go through the anesthesia process, but it is not clear whether the intervention of anesthesia alone will affect the change in the intestinal microbiome. The purpose of this study was to verify the effect of sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia on the intestinal microbiome. The animal in the experimental group was used to provide sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia for 4 hours. The control group was not intervened. The feces of the experimental group and the control group were collected on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th days after anesthesia. Sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia will cause changes in the intestinal microbiome of mice. It appears on the 1st day after anesthesia and is most obvious on the 7th day. The specific manifestation is that the abundance of microbiome and the diversity of the microbiome is reduced. At the same time, Untargeted metabonomics showed that compared with the control group, the experimental group had more increased metabolites related to the different microbiome, among which 5-methylthioadenosine was related to the central nervous system. Subsequently, the intestinal microbiome diversity of mice showed a trend of recovery on the 14th day. At the genus level, the fecal samples obtained on the 14th day after anesthesia exhibited significantly increased abundances of Bacteroides, Alloprevotella, and Akkermansia and significantly decreased abundances of Lactobacillus compared with the samples obtained on the 1st day after anesthesia. However, the abundance of differential bacteria did not recover with the changing trend of diversity. Therefore, we believe that sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia is associated with changes in the internal microbiome and metabolites, and this change may be completed through the brain-gut axis, while sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia may change the intestinal microbiome for as long as 14 days or longer.

The human intestinal microbiome comprises a large number of bacteria and is the main source of intestinal bioactive substances and microbial metabolites. Due to genetic, geographical and other congenital individual differences, host individuals exhibit different intestinal microbial compositions (Roux et al., 2009). In addition, different intestinal microbiomes can also affect the host’s metabolism and immune function (Sender et al., 2016). Under normal circumstances, the gut microbiome of healthy individuals is relatively stable (Lozupone et al., 2012). In response to exposure to stress related to surgery, the human intestinal microbiome might exhibit changes in species, abundance, and metabolites (Guyton and Alverdy, 2017).

The impact of surgery on the intestinal microbiome might currently include (Roux et al., 2009) the application of antibiotics (Sender et al., 2016), intestinal preparation (Lozupone et al., 2012), nutrition, and (Guyton and Alverdy, 2017) surgical methods (Lederer et al., 2017). However, almost all operations will involve the use of anesthesia, but whether anesthesia alone affects the change in the intestinal microbiome remains unclear. Few studies have investigated the effects of anesthesia on the intestinal microbiome. The purpose of this study was to verify the effect of sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia on the intestinal microbiome. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to monitor the dynamic changes in the intestinal microbiome of the experimental and blank control groups on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th days after sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia. Subsequently, Untargeted metabonomics was performed on the 7th feces of the experimental group and the control group.

SPF-grade, 6-8-week-old, Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were provided by Beijing Weitonglihua Experimental Animal Co., Ltd. The mice were placed in a standard squirrel cage under controlled laboratory conditions (22°C and 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle) and given free food and water. The mice were randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group, and the two groups were housed separately in different cages, and the mouse tails were labeled with numbers. Two mice from each group were placed in the same cage and fed.

SPF-grade, 6-8-week-old ICR, male mice were selected, and 16 were randomly divided into two groups of eight mice each. The mice in the experimental group were placed into the anesthesia box, and the animal anesthesia machine was used to provide sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia for 4 hours. The temperature of the experimental environment was controlled at 28 °C to ensure the low temperature of mice. The monitor was used to continuously monitor the concentrations of sevoflurane and oxygen in the anesthesia box and deliver sevoflurane at a rate of 5 L/min. The gas flow was adjusted to maintain a stable MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) value of 1.3, which was equivalent to 2.21% sevoflurane. The gas we used was fresh air, we monitored the oxygen concentration to be 20%, which is consistent with the oxygen content of fresh air. The spontaneous breathing of the animals was continually observed. The mice in the control group were placed in an anesthesia induction box under the same conditions but were not given sevoflurane. After the anesthesia administration period, the mice were fully awakened and returned to their original feeding environment, and their righting reflex was used as an indicator of their recovery. The feces of the experimental and control groups were collected on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th days after anesthesia. The fecal collection was performed at 10 a.m. on the above-mentioned four days, and the samples were collected using sterile EP tubes and stored in a refrigerator at -80°C. We didn’t detect blood gas analysis in the experiment.

Sterile gauze was placed on the operating platform sterilized in the laboratory, and the mouse feces were collected with sterile gauze. A sterile cotton swab was used on the middle part of the mouse feces to reduce the effects of the external environment on the samples. The mouse feces were immediately placed on ice for repacking and marking. A sterile frozen storage tube was used to repack the three tubes (1-2 g in each tube), and immediately after repacking, the tubes were placed into a refrigerator at -80°C.

Microbial DNA from the fecal samples collected from the ICR mice was extracted using a DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocols (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, U.S.). Primers 341f 5 ‘- cctacgggrsgcag-3’ and 806r 5 ‘- ggactacvvvgggtatctatc-3’ (with specific barcode in the primer) were used, The V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes was amplified by PCR (95°C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 98°C for 20 s, 58°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 20 s and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min) using the primers. The PCRs were performed in a 30-µL mixture containing 15 µL of 2× KAPA Library Amplification ReadyMix, 1 µL of each primer (10 µM), 50 ng of template DNA and ddH20. Amplicons were extracted from 2% agarose gels, purified using the AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and quantified using Qubit 2.0 (lnvitrogen, USA). After preparation of the library, these tags were sequenced using a MiSeq platform (Illumina, Inc., CA, USA). DNA extraction, library construction and sequencing were conducted at Realbio Genomics Institute (Shanghai, China).

The full name of PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States). It infers the gene function spectrum of their common ancestors based on the gene information of OTU in greenene database. At the same time, it infers the gene function spectrum of other undetermined species in the database, constructs the gene function prediction spectrum of the whole spectrum of Archaea and bacterial domain, and finally maps the microbiome composition obtained by sequencing into the database to predict the metabolic function of the microbiome.

The data are presented as the means ± SEMs, and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS v.20.0) was used for the statistical analyses. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyze the water maze escape latency and average speed. One-way ANOVA or unpaired t-test was used to analyze the probe quadrant trial data, the probe test data and the relative abundances of bacterial DNA. The differences were considered to be significant if p < 0.05.

Effect of sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia on the abundance of species in the intestinal microbiome: A principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the intestinal microbiome of the experimental mice on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th days after sevoflurane anesthesia was scattered and not aggregated (Figure 1A).There was no significant change of intestinal microbiome in the control group (Figure 1B). An unweighted principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on the UniFrac algorithm showed significant differences between the experimental and control groups on the 1st, 3rd and 7th days after anesthesia (P = 0.001) (Figures 1C–E); moreover, on the 14th day, significant differences were found between the experimental and control groups, but the degree of difference had decreased compared with that detected at previous time points (P = 0.013) (Figure 1F).

We detected the intestinal metabolites on the 7th day after anesthesia, which were significantly different from those on the 1st, 3rd and 14th day: compared with the control group, the experimental group had more increased metabolites (Figure 7). Then, we analyzed the correlation between intestinal microbiome and metabolites, and divided the metabolites into two groups, which were positively correlated with intestinal microbiome: Asparagine 4, 8-Aminocaprylic acid、Lignoceric acid, Taxifolin, 5-methylthioadenosine 4-Vinylphenol, L-4-Hydroxyphenylglycine, 6-phosphogluconic acid, Arachidic acid、Chlorogenic Acid 1, Cortisone、Cerotinic acid, Ribonic acid, gamma-lactone, Behenic acid, Pyruvic acid, Atropine, Glycine 2. The metabolites with negative correlation were 3-Hexenedioic acid (Figure 8).

Whether sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia can induce changes in the intestinal microbiome is unclear. Our results show that the intestinal microbiome of mice is significantly altered after sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia. The diversity of the intestinal microbiome of the mice in the experimental group was significantly different from that of the mice in the control group on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th days. The results obtained for the experimental group on the 1st, 3rd and 14th days were significantly different from those on the 7th day. The diversity of the intestinal microbiome was significantly decreased on the 7th day, which indicated that the effect of sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia on the intestinal microbiome might reach a peak on the 7th day after anesthesia, and this difference was decreased on the 14th day.

Because we didn’t detect blood gas analysis in the experiment, so the limitation of this study is that sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia might lead to changes in physiological indexes, such as hypoxia, hypothermia, hypercapnia and hypotension, in mice. Although these changes might be transient, they could also affect the composition of the intestinal microbiome. Wei Zhang et al. placed two groups of mice at high and low altitude for 30 days, and their results showed that the intestinal microbiome of HC (11% Oxygen) mice exhibited lower abundances of epsilon Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria compared with the intestinal microbiome of NC (16% Oxygen) mice (Zhang et al., 2018). Watkins C et al. collected 10 term infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and treated them with 33.5c total body cooling (TBC) for 72 hours. The control group consisted of nine healthy term infants. Fecal samples from both groups of 2-year-old infants were collected, and the results showed no significant effect on the intestinal microbiome in HIE/TBC infants compared with healthy infants (Watkins et al., 2019). Tripathi et al. simulated sleep apnea syndrome by exposing mice to intermittent hyperoxia and hypercapnia (IHH) for 6 weeks and found that this intervention could lead to changes in the intestinal microbiome and metabolites in mice (Tripathi et al., 2018). At present, few studies have investigated these contents, and the described interventions of mice that exhibit positive results are long term (30 days or 6 weeks). The short-term (4 hours) effects of hypoxia, hypothermia, and hypercapnia on the intestinal microbiome have not been verified, and the experimental results of a low body temperature 42 are negative. The intestinal microbiome changes caused by different blood pressures have not been verified. Therefore, whether the changes in physiological indexes caused by anesthesia over a short period of time have a significant impact on the intestinal microbiome need to be further explored, and their study might be very meaningful. Another limitation is that we only selected male mice for our experiment and did not analyze the influence of different genders on the effects of sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia on the intestinal microbiome. In the future, we will perform relevant experiments to verify our findings.

Sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia is associated with changes in the internal microbiome and metabolites. This change may be completed through the brain gut axis, while sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia may change the intestinal microbiome for as long as 14 days or longer.
