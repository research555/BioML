Role of the Microbiome in the Pathogenesis of COVID-19

The ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease COVID-19 is caused by the highly contagious single-stranded RNA virus, SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has a high rate of evolution like other RNA viruses. The first genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were available in early 2020. Subsequent whole-genome sequencing revealed that the virus had accumulated several mutations in genes associated with viral replication and pathogenesis. These variants showed enhanced transmissibility and infectivity. Soon after the first outbreak due to the wild-type strain in December 2019, a genetic variant D614G emerged in late January to early February 2020 and became the dominant genotype worldwide. Thereafter, several variants emerged, which were found to harbor mutations in essential viral genes encoding proteins that could act as drug and vaccine targets. Numerous vaccines have been successfully developed to assuage the burden of COVID-19. These have different rates of efficacy, including, although rarely, a number of vaccinated individuals exhibiting side effects like thrombosis. However, the recent emergence of the Britain strain with 70% more transmissibility and South African variants with higher resistance to vaccines at a time when several countries have approved these for mass immunization has raised tremendous concern regarding the long-lasting impact of currently available prophylaxis. Apart from studies addressing the pathophysiology, pathogenesis, and therapeutic targets of SARS-CoV-2, analysis of the gut, oral, nasopharyngeal, and lung microbiome dysbiosis has also been undertaken to find a link between the microbiome and the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Therefore, in the current scenario of skepticism regarding vaccine efficacy and challenges over the direct effects of currently available drugs looming large, investigation of alternative therapeutic avenues based on the microbiome can be a rewarding finding. This review presents the currently available understanding of microbiome dysbiosis and its association with cause and consequence of COVID-19. Taking cues from other inflammatory diseases, we propose a hypothesis of how the microbiome may be influencing homeostasis, pro-inflammatory condition, and the onset of inflammation. This accentuates the importance of a healthy microbiome as a protective element to prevent the onset of COVID-19. Finally, the review attempts to identify areas where the application of microbiome research can help in reducing the burden of the disease.

SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is the causative agent of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, one of the worst pandemics in documented history (Morens et al., 2020). Individual SARS-CoV-2 is classified under realm Riboviria and order Nidovirales, suborder Cornidovirineae, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus, and species severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 2020). It is of zoonotic origin, and transmission occurs by droplets and surface contact (Tay et al., 2020). The air-borne transmission theory of the virus has been widely debated (Greenhalgh et al., 2021; Samet et al., 2021). Indirect evidence suggests that the air-borne transmission hypothesis may be true (Greenhalgh et al., 2021; Samet et al., 2021). Other possible routes of transmission are aerosol (Bchetnia et al., 2020; Salzberger et al., 2020) and the fecal–oral route (Tay et al., 2020; Walsh et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2021). COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease and spreads rapidly (has a reproductive number R0 in the range 2–3) (Li et al., 2020). It affects the lower respiratory tract causing severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure in susceptible individuals leading to death in the most severe cases (Bchetnia et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020). The individuals mostly at risk are those with weakened and dysregulated immune system and those with comorbidities like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, asthma, cancer, dementia, obesity, and other underlying clinical conditions (Dolk, 2020; Grasselli et al., 2020; Leon et al., 2020). Other risk groups include immunocompromised individuals, old age population, and those undergoing surgery and organ transplantation (Williamson et al., 2020). Males compared to females and Africans and South Asians are more prone to the disease (Williamson et al., 2020). GWAS have been conducted to identify the genetic basis of COVID-19 susceptibility (Karim et al., 2020; Katz et al., 2020). Susceptibility to respiratory failure in infected patients has been found to be linked to the genetic background of the individual (Karim et al., 2020; Katz et al., 2020). Determinants of disease severity lie in host factors (Kaser, 2020). Variants at two loci have been identified to be associated with susceptibility to severe COVID-19 (Kaser, 2020). The rs657152-A variant at ABO locus 9q34.2 has been found to be responsible for deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and elevated levels of the von Willebrand factor and factor VIII and also high levels of interleukin-6, which are seen in patients during disease severity (Karim et al., 2020; Katz et al., 2020). Blood groups A and B are more at risk of thromboembolism than group O irrespective of the COVID-19 status (Karim et al., 2020; Katz et al., 2020). rs505922-C polymorphism has been found to be associated with higher levels of the soluble lectin CD209 (Karim et al., 2020; Katz et al., 2020).Variants at the multigene locus 3p21.31 are associated with levels of CXCL16, an inflammatory chemokine associated with alveolitis and atherogenesis (Kaser, 2020; Katz et al., 2020). An insertion deletion GA or G variant at rs11385942 in the LZTFL1 gene at locus 3p21.31 is associated with a predisposition toward the most severe forms of COVID-19 (Kaser, 2020).

The first genome sequences were those isolated from the 3 patients associated with the seafood market (Zhu et al., 2020). This was followed by rapid sequencing of ten strains from nine other hosts associated with the seafood market (Lu et al., 2020). These were available in early 2020 (Lu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) and helped in tracking the phylogeny and the probable origin of the virus to bat, indicating bat–human transmission, but through an intermediate Malayan pangolin host (Lam et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 was found to have 86.9% nucleotide sequence identity to the bat SARS-like CoV, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 genomes (Zhu et al., 2020). It bore about 79% genetic relatedness to SARS-CoV and about 50% identity to MERS-CoV (Lu et al., 2020). Homology modeling revealed that it had a similar receptor binding domain structure like SARS-CoV (Lu et al., 2020). This implied that the virus uses ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) as the receptor (Lu et al., 2020). All the strains associated with the seafood market showed 99.98% sequence identity to each other with the maximum difference of only four mutations (Lu et al., 2020). Thereafter, a number of strains from different places in the world were sequenced and revealed the emergence of mutants (Islam et al., 2020; Yadav et al., 2020). Thereafter, studies investigating infectivity, transmission rate, pathogenesis, and overall virulence of the virus were undertaken (Li et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). The availability of genome sequencing and homology modeling data has assisted in the rapid development of a number of effective vaccines like COVAXIN™ (https://www.bharatbiotech.com/covaxin.html), mRNA-1273 (Baden et al., 2021), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 AZD1222 (Ramasamy et al., 2021), Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (BNT162b2) (Oliver et al., 2020), and others among 259 vaccines, which are being produced and marketed globally (Haidere et al., 2021). These have been introduced for mass immunization in most of the countries of the world 3 . The emergence of variants has also raised concern regarding the inefficiency of serum immunoglobulins from previous infection and convalescent patients in neutralizing the virus on reinfection (Li et al., 2020). It has raised trepidations about the usefulness of the vaccines against new strains and also regarding the long-term efficacy of currently available vaccines just introduced on a mass scale (Li et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020; Haidere et al., 2021). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the availability of highly advanced epidemiological monitoring tools have helped in tracking the spread of the disease with new-age tactics (Massacci et al., 2020). At the same time, it has also helped in understanding the dysbiosis of microbiome associated with COVID-19. The microbiome is an important factor crucial for homeostasis and healthy state of the body. Its dysbiosis has been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases. Therefore, studying the microbiome in COVID-19 will illuminate unexplored alternate avenues for understanding pathogenesis and outcome and in turn may help to identify potential therapeutic markers. In the review, we present a brief perspective on how the emergence of variants has challenged the different prophylactic and therapeutic measures currently implemented to control the virus and also complete up-to-date information on the recent analysis of microbiome in COVID-19 patients. The review has focused on the dysbiosis observed and proposed how the microbiome may be contributing toward the onset of cytokine storm, inflammation, and overall pathogenesis of COVID-19 by taking cues from other diseases. In the prevailing situation where variants may challenge the currently available prophylactic and therapeutic measures, targeting the microbiome may be a beneficial alternate avenue for COVID-19 prevention and therapy.

The genetic material of the virus is positively coiled single-stranded RNA (Laamarti et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 genome is 29.8–29.9 kb in size (Elrashdy et al., 2020; Laamarti et al., 2020). The genomic organization is typical of coronaviruses (Elrashdy et al., 2020; Laamarti et al., 2020). The polyprotein ORF1ab, which is also known as the polyprotein replicase, encompasses over two-thirds of the genome at the 5’-end (Elrashdy et al., 2020; Laamarti et al., 2020). It comprises several nonstructural proteins (NSPs), which are involved in viral replication (Elrashdy et al., 2020; Laamarti et al., 2020) like the overlapping polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab (Elrashdy et al., 2020; Laamarti et al., 2020). These are required for viral replication and transcription (Elrashdy et al., 2020; Laamarti et al., 2020). Four structural proteins, namely, the spike glycoprotein, an envelope protein, a membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein, are also encoded by the genome (Elrashdy et al., 2020; Laamarti et al., 2020). Accessory proteins ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, and ORF10 are hypothetical proteins with unidentified functions, which are also found in the genome (Elrashdy et al., 2020; Laamarti et al., 2020).

Lu et al. reported ten genomic sequences of the novel coronavirus isolated from 9 inpatients from 3 hospitals in Wuhan and admitted due to viral pneumonia of unknown cause and diagnosed negative for other common respiratory pathogens (Lu et al., 2020). Sequencing was performed using Illumina and Nanopore systems generating 8 complete and 2 partial genome sequences (Lu et al., 2020). Bat-SL-CoVZC45 was used as the reference genome (Lu et al., 2020). The eight complete genome sequences were almost identical sharing 99.98% sequence identity among themselves, indicating a very recent introduction into humans (Lu et al., 2020). The maximum difference obtained was that of only 4 mutations (Lu et al., 2020). With Blastn the complete genomes showed 87.99% and 87.23% sequence identity with Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21, respectively (Lu et al., 2020). Sequence homology of greater than 90% compared to these two bat-derived SARS-like β-coronaviruses was observed in five regions, namely, E, M, 7, N, and 14 culminating in 98.7% sequence identity in the E gene (Lu et al., 2020). Ia and 1b showed about 90% and about 86% sequence identity, respectively (Lu et al., 2020). The S gene had the lowest sequence identity of 75% (Lu et al., 2020). Encoded protein sequences bore high identity except the spike protein and protein 13, which showed only about 80% and 73.2% sequence homology, respectively (Lu et al., 2020). The novel coronavirus was found to have about 79% similarity with SARS-CoV and about 50% with MERS-CoV (Lu et al., 2020). Homology modeling showed that the virus has an identical genomic organization like the bat-derived SARS-like β-coronaviruses (Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21) and SARS-CoV with only minor deletions and insertions being noted in the 12 coding regions that were identified (Lu et al., 2020). The 12 coding regions also included 1ab, S, 3, E, M, 7, 8, 9, 10b, N, 13, and 14 (Lu et al., 2020). However, SARS-CoV-2 encodes a longer spike protein compared to that of the bat SARS-like β-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Lu et al., 2020). The 10 SARS-CoV-2 strains along with the two bat reference strains formed a distinct clade (clade 2) under the sarbecovirus subgenus, while SARS-CoV formed clade 3 based on WGS (Lu et al., 2020). According to phylogenetic analysis based on the complete sequence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, SARC-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were two separate and distinct clades in the phylogenetic tree (Lu et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 clustered with Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21 in the phylogenetic tree based on 1a and spike protein gene sequences, while they were distinctly segregated by sequence of the 1b gene (Lu et al., 2020).

Rapid analysis of genome sequences of many SARS-CoV-2 strains were undertaken worldwide (Koyama et al., 2020; Weber et al., 2020). It helped to detect mutations that occurred in the strains, track the emergence of new variants, and also understand the distribution of the different variants (Koyama et al., 2020; Weber et al., 2020). This analysis also showed that from time to time different genetic variants emerged and spread to different countries of the world and were soon overtaken by latter variants (Koyama et al., 2020). Different studies reporting about the emergence of variants, their genetic diversity, and spatiotemporal distribution have been presented in Table 1 . Among these, the D614G clade was the most common and was first found in late January 2020 in China, according to a study conducted by Koyama et al. (2020). It became the largest clade in three months (Koyama et al., 2020). Earliest samples from the USA appeared to have been derived from China and belonged to basal or L84S clades, while subsequent infected samples associated with European clades, such as D614G/Q57H (Koyama et al., 2020).

NGS has been beneficial for the investigation of the association of the microbiome with COVID-19 pathogenesis (Zuo et al., 2020a). These efforts have been prompted by the drive for understanding the complicated pathogenesis of the disease and in the hunt for alternative control measures for the virus. These could be successfully implemented alongside currently available treatment or at a juncture where current methods succumb to the force of genetic evolution. In view of the prevailing scenario discussed above, we present the most recent analysis related to the microbiome in the event of COVID-19 with the anticipation of understanding the prospective role that the microbiome would play in attenuating the disease burden of the ongoing pandemic.

Futuristic investigation on oral, lung, brain, and gut microbiome has been undertaken by several researchers worldwide with an attempt to understand the involvement of the microbiome in COVID-19 pathogenesis (Zuo et al., 2020a). A number of studies have addressed the issue and have shown the involvement of the GI tract in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and found a correlation between the microbiome and the clinical outcome of the disease (Zuo et al., 2020a). Accordingly, gut microbiome dysbiosis has been found to be associated with disease severity and progression (Zuo et al., 2020a; Yeoh et al., 2021). The depletion of commensals in the gut has been positively correlated with the severity of COVID-19 (Zuo et al., 2020a). This indicates not only the influence of the disease on the gut microbiome structure but also the significance of a healthy gut microbiome signature in the prevention of the disease onset (Zuo et al., 2020a). Similarly, lung microbiome analysis revealed dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients and yielded far-fetched results suggestive of significant involvement of the microbiome in the development of critical illness (Mostafa et al., 2020; Maes et al., 2021). All the studies on gut, lung, oral, and nasopharyngeal microbiota conducted so far have found that beneficial commensals are depleted while opportunistic pathogens undergo an upsurge in abundance (Bao et al., 2020; Mostafa et al., 2020; Zuo et al., 2020a; Nardelli et al., 2021; Yeoh et al., 2021). Moreover, the microbiome diversity was observed to be diminished in the event of COVID-19 as opposed to healthy individuals and non-COVID-19 subjects (Gu et al., 2020). Table 2 presents a snapshot of the dysbiosis observed in the COVID-19–associated microbiome.

Zuo et al., in a pilot study, investigated the dysbiosis of fecal microbiomes of patients with COVID-19 and investigated its association with disease severity (Zuo et al., 2020a). Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on fecal samples from 15 patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong (Zuo et al., 2020a). Fecal samples were collected 2 to 3 times weekly from the time of hospitalization till discharge (Zuo et al., 2020a). They classified disease severity as mild, moderate, severe, or critical depending on clinical parameters (Zuo et al., 2020a). The results were compared with those from 6 patients with community-acquired pneumonia and 15 healthy individuals (Zuo et al., 2020a). They found a distinct pattern of microbiome dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients compared with controls (Zuo et al., 2020a). It was characterized by an enrichment of opportunistic pathogens and a decrease in the abundance of beneficial commensals throughout the period of hospitalization (Zuo et al., 2020a). Symbionts were found to be depleted and gut dysbiosis persisted even after clearance of infection (Zuo et al., 2020a). Abundance of Coprobacillus, Clostridium ramosum, and Clostridium hathewayi correlated with severity (Zuo et al., 2020a). Abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and disease severity were negatively correlated (Zuo et al., 2020a). Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides massiliensis, and Bacteroides ovatus, which have been reported to downregulate the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in murine gut, was inversely correlated with viral load in feces of patients during the entire period of hospitalization (Zuo et al., 2020a).

Longxian et al. conducted fecal mycobiota analysis based on ITS sequencing in 67 COVID-19 patients, 35 H1N1-infected patients, and 48 matched healthy controls (Lv et al., 2021a). They used the results and correlated them with symptoms and gut microbiota (Lv et al., 2021a). They observed that depletion of Aspergillus and Penicillium was characteristic in the diseased patients (Lv et al., 2021a). In COVID-19 patients, positive correlation was found between Mucoromycota and Fusicatenibacter, Aspergillus niger and diarrhea, and Penicillium citrinum was negatively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP) (Lv et al., 2021a). In H1N1 infection, the results were strikingly different and well distinguished from those of COVID-19 individuals (Lv et al., 2021a). The authors observed that the gut mycobiota dysbiosis persisted in the patients till the time of their discharge from the hospital (Lv et al., 2021a).

Metatranscriptomic and metagenomic sequencing was conducted by Mostafa et al. using the Oxford Nanopore platform on nasopharyngeal swab specimens from 50 patients undergoing investigation for COVID-19, and data were analyzed using the Cosmos ID bioinformatics platform (Mostafa et al., 2020). The microbiome exhibited decreased diversity, and the composition could be significantly associated with disease (Mostafa et al., 2020). Higher abundance of Propionibacteriaceae and depletion of Corynebacterium accolens were found in negative samples (Mostafa et al., 2020).

Zhong et al. characterized respiratory microbiota dysbiosis in 23 (8 mild and 15 severe) hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China using sputum, nasal swab, throat swab, anal swab, and feces (Zhong et al., 2021). Ultra-deep metatranscriptomic profiling of the samples was performed (Zhong et al., 2021). Distinct microbiome signatures were observed in the severely ill patients undergoing antibiotic therapy, and other human respiratory viruses like alphaherpesvirus 1, rhinovirus B, and human orthopneumovirus were detected in 30.8% severe cases but not in mild cases (Zhong et al., 2021). Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC), Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Mycoplasma spp. (including M. hominis and M. orale) were the predominant respiratory microbial taxa detected in the severely ill patients (Zhong et al., 2021).

During COVID-19 infection, a large number of co-infections were found to be caused due to oral pathogens (Bao et al., 2020). These included viruses, fungi, and bacteria originating from the oral cavity (Bao et al., 2020). Marouf et al. conducted a case-control-based analysis with 568 patients of COVID-19 and showed the association of periodontitis with the severity of COVID-19 (Marouf et al., 2021). Soffritti et al. analyzed the human oral microbiome (HOM) (bacteria, virus, fungi) in COVID-19 patients using mouth rinse sample and subjecting these to WGS (Soffritti et al., 2021). They observed oral dysbiosis in the patients compared to matched controls (Soffritti et al., 2021). Dysbiosis was marked with the decrease in alpha-diversity and lower species richness, higher inflammation, and disease severity (Soffritti et al., 2021). The specific pattern of dysbiosis observed is presented in Table 2 (Soffritti et al., 2021). Enterobacter sp. and Enterococcus sp. were identified uniquely only in COVID-19 patients (Soffritti et al., 2021). The species richness of the oral mycobiome was found to increase in COVID-19 patients and so was the oral virome (Soffritti et al., 2021).

It has been found that salivary glands act as reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatics (Xu et al., 2020). Periodontal pockets have also been proposed to be sites in the oral cavity that act as reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 (Badran et al., 2020). These reports indicate the involvement of the oral microbiota in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (Bao et al., 2020). Poor oral hygiene causes oral microbiome dysbiosis and enriches pathogenic oral bacteria (Patel and Sampson, 2020). A number of studies have revealed the close association between oral pathogens and respiratory diseases (Scannapieco et al., 2003; Gomes-Filho et al., 2020).

Microbiome analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs revealed a strong association of the nasopharyngeal microbiota and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 (Nardelli et al., 2021). The analysis showed that although 5 phyla, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria, were consistently present in both the control and cases, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria was significantly reduced in COVID-19 positive individuals (Nardelli et al., 2021). At the genus level, Leptotrichia, Fusobacterium, and Hemophilus were significantly low in cases compared to controls (Nardelli et al., 2021). At the species level, Fusobacterium peridonticum was significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (Nardelli et al., 2021). This indicated the protective role of these bacteria in SARS-CoV-2 as they have been previously shown to be involved in the sialylation of the cell surface (Yoneda et al., 2014; Nardelli et al., 2021).

A healthy microbiome plays a significant role in protecting against diseases (Lynch and Pedersen, 2016). It is an essential component of the host and has been often considered as an organ of the human body (Baquero and Nombela, 2012). It is involved in maintaining homeostasis, metabolic, and physiological activities, helps in the breakdown of complex nutrients like complex carbohydrates, fats and fatty acids, fermentation of nondigestible dietary residues, digestion, epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, vitamin synthesis, and absorption of metal ions, and also accords immune protection (Guarner and Malagelada, 2003). In neonates, it has been found to help in the maturation of the immune system (Gensollen et al., 2016). It has been estimated that in the human gut lumen alone, the number of microbial cells is ten times greater than the number of eukaryotic cells reflecting the richness of diversity in its structural composition (Guarner and Malagelada, 2003). Though the composition varies with different parameters like diet, geography, ethnicity, and lifestyle and personal habits, the composition is largely affected by the clinical condition of an individual (De, 2019; Kalantar-Zadeh et al., 2020; Lv et al., 2021b). A drastic alteration in the composition has been found to occur in the event of diseases (Hay and Zhu, 2014). This shift in the microbiota composition and its total function, consequentially perturbing homeostasis, is referred to as dysbiosis. This imbalance has been found to exist in almost all diseases in which microbiome analysis has been undertaken (Levy et al., 2017). The microbiota has been found to be distinctively differential between healthy and the disease state (Ma et al., 2019), and often dysbiosis is accompanied by reduction in diversity (Gu et al., 2020). Microbiome analysis has enabled the successful establishment of specific microbiome signatures associated with different diseases (Hsiao et al., 2014; De et al., 2020). Many of the organisms associated with these signatures have been developed as prognostic and diagnostic markers and probiotics (Ritchie and Romanuk, 2012; Integrative HMP (iHMP) Research Network Consortium, 2019; Temraz et al., 2019). Today, microbiome analysis is integral in the quest for a complete understanding of pathogenesis of any disease.

Evident from microbiome analysis in COVID-19 patients, a potential link exists between the microbiome and COVID-19 (Gu et al., 2020). Several authors have also proposed a probable link between various pathological events occurring during COVID-19 pathogenesis and microbiota dysbiosis (Saleh et al., 2020; Viana et al., 2020). Saleh et al. proposed that mitochondrial oxidative stress observed during the disease leads to microbiota dysbiosis (Saleh et al., 2020). Viana et al. proposed that ACE2, the major receptor for entry of SARS-CoV-2 (Viana et al., 2020) and which also serves as a chaperone for the amino acid transporter B0AT1 and ACE2/B0AT1 complex (Viana et al., 2020), has been shown to be modulators of gut microbiome and has proposed the association of dysfunctions of ACE2 and gut microbiota dysbiosis (Viana et al., 2020). However, all these propositions are based on indirect evidence (Saleh et al., 2020). Inference has been based on observations obtained from research related to other diseases (Saleh et al., 2020). Investigation in COVID-19 is still pending. Based on microbiome analysis results in COVID-19 and correlating it with the current knowledge of pathological conditions occurring during SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis (Contini et al., 2020), we have speculated in the following sections how the microbiome may be associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis.

SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelial cells and macrophages, which express the surface receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and TMPRSS2 (Tay et al., 2020). These cells include the airway epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, and macrophages in the lung (Tay et al., 2020). However, gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations like diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting in COVID-19 patients (Ong et al., 2020) were suggestive of the involvement of the infection of the GI tract and also the possible role of the gut microbiome in pathogenesis (Mao et al., 2020; Villapol, 2020). Recent studies indicate that the virus can infect the GI tract leading to inflammation of digestive tissues (Jiao et al., 2021). The mature enterocytes also express ACE2 and TMPRSS4 protease (Devaux et al., 2021). The GI tract has been also found to be a reservoir and a site of replication for SARS-CoV-2 (Devaux et al., 2021).

The above studies have shown how dysregulation of ACE-2 expression leads to microbiota changes in COVID-19 (de Oliveira et al., 2020). The events described above have been summarized in Figure 1 , and the events leading to microbiome dysbiosis have been speculated.

Since microbiome has been posited as one of the environmental factors that are significantly involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and infectious diseases (O’Dwyer et al., 2019), therefore, next, we tried to understand by taking cues from other diseases how the microbiome can contribute to inflammation in COVID-19 and may play a significant strategic role in its pathogenesis.

Several other studies have shown the critical involvement of microbiota in facilitating inflammation and laying the groundwork for different inflammatory diseases involving vital organs (Wang et al., 2019). Wang et al. successfully depicted how microbiota can influence the induction of liver inflammation (Wang et al., 2019). They treated ducklings with oral gavage of Ochratoxin A (OTA), analyzed microbiota in the cecum and liver with 16S rRNA sequencing, and studied inflammation in the liver (Wang et al., 2019). Intestinal microbiota was cleared with antibiotics, and subsequent fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) ensued (Wang et al., 2019). The authors reported that OTA treatment in ducks altered the intestinal microbiota composition and structure and induced the accumulation of LPS and inflammation in the liver (Wang et al., 2019). However, on antibiotic treatment, this was inhibited indicating that OTA-induced inflammation in the liver is mediated by microbiota (Wang et al., 2019). FMT from OTA-treated ducks induced liver inflammation in antibiotic-treated ducks (Wang et al., 2019). The lower expression of mRNA and the lower protein abundance of TJP1 and Occludin in recipient ducks, elevated levels of LPS and elevated liver inflammation in recipient ducks, including higher mRNA expression of TLR4 and TNF-α, protein abundance of TLR4, Myd88, and p-p65, the ratio of p-IKBα/IKBα, secretion of IL-1β and IL-6, and inflammatory cell infiltration occurred (Wang et al., 2019). This microbiota also enhanced the levels of LPS and TNF-α in the serum (Wang et al., 2019). Kishikawa et al. conducted a metagenome-wide association study in a Japanese population with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to understand the role of the RA-associated microbiome in the pathogenesis of RA (Kishikawa et al., 2020). They observed high abundance of the genus Prevotella, a significant reduction of redox reaction-related gene (R6FCZ7) in the RA microbiome, and an enrichment of metabolic pathways like fatty acid biosynthesis and glycosaminoglycan degradation in case-control comparison (Kishikawa et al., 2020). The studies described above indicated that the microbiome plays a significant role in disease development, progression, and in inducing inflammation (Yadava et al., 2016; Molyneaux et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019).

There have been several speculations on the mechanisms by which microbiota mediates the inflammatory process and facilitates an inflammatory milieu (Khlevner et al., 2018). Many authors have proposed that the microbiome is a key component regulating the gut–brain axis, a bidirectional communication system between the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT)/ENS (enteric nervous system) through the vagus nerve or by the production of active metabolites that influence enteric function, affect the CNS, and are carried in the blood across the blood–brain barrier (Khlevner et al., 2018). Serotonin has been proposed to be a potential link between the gut and the brain (Khlevner et al., 2018). Moreover, the gut microbiota has been found to be a modulator of serotonin biosynthesis (Reigstad et al., 2015). Numerous studies have shown a crucial link among the microbiome, serotonin production, and the CNS and ENS (O’Mahony et al., 2015).

Microbiome induces chronic inflammation in the different inflammatory diseases (Haran et al., 2019). Microbiome analysis of COVID-19 patients already described has revealed the presence of many commensals like Parabacteroides merdae, Bacteroides stercoris, Alistipes onderdonkii, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 1_1_57FAA, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (Zuo et al., 2020a), Eubacterium rectale, and Bifidobacteria (Yeoh et al., 2021) in the disease microbiome and a negative correlation with disease severity and pathogen load (Zuo et al., 2020a). On the other hand, several other bacteria like Collinsella aerofaciens, Collinsella tanakaei, Streptococcus infantis, Morganella morganii, Coprobacillus, Clostridium ramosum, and Clostridium hathewayi were found to be overrepresented in the COVID-19-associated microbiome and correlated positively with SARS-CoV-2 infectivity; these are presented in Table 2 (Zuo et al., 2020a; Yeoh et al., 2021). The abnormal microbiome found to be associated with COVID-19 may, therefore, have a plausible role in promoting inflammation and favoring the onset of the pathogenesis of this severe disease as observed in the case of other disorders (Haran et al., 2019).

Several studies have addressed the function of commensals, which have also been found to be associated with COVID-19–associated microbiome (Sokol et al., 2008). These commensals have been found to be significant for the maintenance of gut health and homeostasis, while other taxa overrepresented in the COVID-19 microbiome play an adverse role and promote an inflammatory milieu (Sokol et al., 2008). Figure 3 shows a general outline of how microbiome dysbiosis due to increased abundance of pathobionts leads to an inflammatory state, while the presence of commensals in the correct proportion can shift this balance and suppress inflammation.

An abundance of opportunistic pathogens in the microbiome leads to adverse reactions in inflammatory diseases as has been demonstrated in the case of colitis using a TNBS mouse model (Lee et al., 2009). This evidence suggests that the inflammatory state stimulates GAG-degrading activity of pathobionts (Lee et al., 2009). Therefore, although pathobionts with GAG-degrading activity may contribute to the aggravation of inflammatory diseases including COVID-19 (Lee et al., 2009), enzymes from the beneficial commensal flora can breakdown HS and prevent the adhesion of the virus and inhibit its entry (Cheudjeu, 2020; Martino et al., 2020). Pan et al. showed how commensals like L. casei may influence the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis by suppressing adjuvant-induced-arthritis (AIA) significantly in a rat model (Pan et al., 2019). L. casei applied to AIA rats led to the inhibition of joint swelling and prevented bone destruction (Pan et al., 2019). It also reduced microbiome dysbiosis in AIA rats and downregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Pan et al., 2019). Commensals are therefore essential to maintain an anti-inflammatory environment, thereby accentuating the importance of commensals with anti-inflammatory function in the microbiome. Therefore, greater emphasis on the role of commensals in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and prevention of the disease may be highly beneficial. The mechanism of modulation of inflammation by the microbiome may help to identify disease markers for therapy. The commensals can also be exploited as pre- and probiotics for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Momentous strides have been made in this direction (Hegazy et al., 2021). Hegazy et al. already found conclusive evidence that a healthy gut microbiome leads to better outcome in COVID-19 (Hegazy et al., 2021). They conducted a longitudinal study in COVID-19 patients to evaluate the role of factors like nutrients and lifestyle, which modulate gut microbiome (Hegazy et al., 2021). They found a negative correlation between the consumption of probiotic food and the severity of COVID-19 (Hegazy et al., 2021). A randomized trial is being conducted using COVID-19 patients to test the safety and effect on COVID-19 of KB109, a synthetic glycan that has been found to be formulated to modulate the gut microbiome and lead to enhancement of beneficial SCFA production in the gut (Haran et al., 2021).

At present, most of the countries of the world are facing the bouts of the second wave (Pullano et al., 2021; Cele et al., 2021) due to the different variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Khailany et al., 2020) like B.1.1.7 lineage (20B/501Y.V1 variant of concern [VOC] 202012/01) and B.1.351 lineage (20C/501Y.V2) identified from the UK and South Africa, respectively, followed by B.1.1.248/B1.1.28/P1 (501Y.V3) identified in Brazil and the B.1.427/B.1.429 lineage identified in California (Tang et al., 2020b; Yadav et al., 2021), and mainly the delta variant, which is at present dominant in most of the parts of the world (Rahman et al., 2021). At the time of writing the article, there have been over 278 million confirmed cases and over 5.4 million deaths worldwide 7 . A third wave is impending in these countries (Yoo, 2020; Pullano et al., 2021; Soriano et al., 2021).

Analysis of the COVID-19 microbiome showed that the microbiome is intricately associated with the pathophysiological conditions of the disease (Hoque et al., 2021). These studies have been conducted using subjects across varied populations and different age groups (Zuo et al., 2020a; Yeoh et al., 2021). The constant outcome observed irrespective of these differences was that COVID-19 presented dysbiosis of microbiome (Gu et al., 2020; Zuo et al., 2020a; Yeoh et al., 2021). The study subjects used as controls to study COVID-19–related dysbiosis reported no comorbidities, thereby presenting a profile representing dysbiosis due to COVID-19 alone (Zuo et al., 2020a; Yeoh et al., 2021). Enriching the beneficial microbes in the microbiome of the host and controlling the proportion of opportunistic pathogens (Kendall and Sperandio, 2021) will eventually help to prevent an inflammatory milieu, which could ease the onset of ARDS and other pathogenesis events in COVID-19 (Kendall and Sperandio, 2021). Lifestyle changes would be a subtle area that can help in the favorable growth of beneficial microbes and may include less exposure to pollution, abstaining from unnecessary use of antibiotics (Kendall and Sperandio, 2021), eating a diet rich in fiber, fermented foods, and prebiotics (Bousquet et al., 2021; Kendall and Sperandio, 2021) which favor the enrichment of healthy microbiota (Gasmi et al., 2021), and strict implementation of handwashing and brushing as it has been found that patients with GI symptoms suffer from worse COVID-19 outcome (Han et al., 2021; Gallardo-Escárate et al., 2021). These would help in alleviating the risk factors of inflammation and help in securing a healthy immune system, which is a prerequisite for avoiding the trauma associated with COVID-19. These insights may eventually lead to treatment and prophylactic modules for COVID-19 based on the microbiome. Another benefit of intervention based on the microbiome would be its effectiveness on all available variants of SARS-CoV-2 in contrast to current measures of prophylaxis and therapy. Therefore, the high rate of viral genomic mutation would not pose an obstacle to its long-term and broad-range efficiency. Till now, five variants designated as variants of concern (VOCs) by ECDC have been detected, namely, the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Alpha+E484K (B.1.1.7+E484K), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2), and seven SARS-CoV-2 variants are considered variants of interest (VOIs) (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/threat-assessment-emergence-and- impact-sars-cov-2-delta-variant). This genetic diversity shows the high rate of evolution of the virus, and therefore, a pressing concern vesting upon the scientific community would be a unanimous antidote to control the infection. Microbiome could serve as a unanimous remedy for the situation.
