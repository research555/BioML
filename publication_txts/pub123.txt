Second-generation antipsychotics and metabolism alterations: a systematic review of the role of the gut microbiome

Multiple drugs are known to induce metabolic malfunctions, among them second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). The pathogenesis of such adverse effects is of multifactorial origin.

We investigated whether SGAs drive dysbiosis, assessed whether gut microbiota alterations affect body weight and metabolic outcomes, and looked for the possible mechanism of metabolic disturbances secondary to SGA treatment in animal and human studies.

A systematic literature search (PubMed/Medline/Embase/ClinicalTrials.gov/PsychInfo) was conducted from database inception until 03 July 2018 for studies that reported the microbiome and weight alterations in SGA-treated subjects.

Seven articles reporting studies in mice (experiments = 8) and rats (experiments = 3) were included. Olanzapine was used in five and risperidone in six experiments. Only three articles (experiments = 4) in humans fit our criteria of using risperidone and mixed SGAs. The results confirmed microbiome alterations directly (rodent experiments = 5, human experiments = 4) or indirectly (rodent experiments = 4) with predominantly increased Firmicutes abundance relative to Bacteroidetes, as well as weight gain in rodents (experiments = 8) and humans (experiments = 4). Additionally, olanzapine administration was found to induce both metabolic alterations (adiposity, lipogenesis, plasma free fatty acid, and acetate levels increase) (experiments = 3) and inflammation (experiments = 2) in rodents, whereas risperidone suppressed the resting metabolic rate in rodents (experiments = 5) and elevated fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, LDL, hs-CRP, antioxidant superoxide dismutase, and HOMA-IR in humans (experiment = 1). One rodent study suggested a gender-dependent effect of dysbiosis on body weight.

Antipsychotic treatment-related microbiome alterations potentially result in body weight gain and metabolic disturbances. Inflammation and resting metabolic rate suppression seem to play crucial roles in the development of metabolic disorders.

Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have been used successfully for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, autism spectrum disorders, major depressive disorders, tic disorder, agitation, sleeping problems, and dementia, among others (Vasan and Abdijadid 2018). The number of prescriptions for SGAs has increased worldwide for both youths and adults (Ilies et al. 2017), with the most recent cross-sectional study of 14 countries finding that quetiapine, risperidone (RIS), and olanzapine (OLZ) are the most frequently prescribed atypical SGAs (Hálfdánarson et al. 2017). An alarming increase in prescriptions, particularly in youth between 15 and 19 years of age, forces us to turn our attention to the health consequences of long-term SGA treatment (Kalverdijk et al. 2017). These consequences include various cardiometabolic adverse effects, such as significant weight gain, hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, and impaired glucose metabolism (De Hert et al. 2011; Galling and Correll 2015; Galling et al. 2016; Vancampfort et al. 2016), which are all related to metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (Sjo et al. 2017). These changes emerge even after short exposure and increase with cumulative dosages, and differ between agents (Bak et al. 2014).

Therefore, we prepared the first systematic review (SR) investigating the following aims: (1) whether SGAs drive dysbiosis, (2) assessing whether alterations of gut microbiota composition and function affect body weight and metabolic outcome, and (3) examining the possible mechanisms of metabolic disturbances secondary to SGA treatment in rodent and human studies.

This study was conducted according to the requirements established in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocols (Shamseer et al. 2015). Two independent authors (AM and KSZ) systematically searched PubMed/Medline/Embase/PsycInfo/Clinicaltrials.gov from database inception until 03 July 2018. The search was conducted using the following terms identified as medical subject headings (MeSH bold font), Supplementary Concept Record terms (SCR italic font), and free text terms: (Microbiota OR Gastrointestinal Microbiome OR microbiome OR microbio*) AND (antipsych* OR neurolept* OR SGA* OR Antipsychotic agents OR Anti-Anxiety agents OR Anti-depressive Agents OR Anti-depressive Agents, Second-Generation OR Hypnotics and Sedatives OR Antimanic Agents OR Olanzapine OR Risperidone OR Atypical Antipsychotics) AND (Body Weight OR Body Weight Changes OR Body Weights and Measures OR Body Mass Index OR BMI OR Metabolism OR metabolic* OR Lipids OR tRMR OR Cholesterol OR Triglycerides OR Cholesterol, LDL OR LDL OR Fatty Acids OR Fatty Acids, Volatile OR Acetates OR Butyrates OR Butyric Acid OR Propionates OR hepatic* OR SCFA OR Toxins, Biological OR Bacterial Toxins OR Endotoxins OR Lipopolysaccharides OR Lipid A OR O Antigens OR LPS OR Glucose OR Insulin OR HOMA-IR OR Inflammation OR Cytokines OR Interleukins). Reviews, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews were omitted from the search strategy. The electronic search was supplemented by a manual review of the reference lists from eligible publications and relevant reviews.

Inclusion criteria for animal/human studies were as follows:

At least two authors (AM, KSZ, IŁ) independently extracted information from each study, including details on study characteristics (e.g., study design, treatment protocol, duration, number of subjects, outcome parameters, gut microbiota analysis technique), treatment characteristics (e.g., psychopharmacological agent, dosage, duration of treatment), and subject/patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities, metabolic outcomes). When abstracting data from figures, WebPlot digitizer software was used (https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/).

The significance of the analysed studies was arbitrarily assigned according to the following scheme: strong—germ-free study, faecal transplantation, statistical significance; middle—conflicting data, lack of relevance due to small group size, data difficult to explain; weak—only co-incidence.

Two authors (KSŻ and IŁ) independently assessed the risk of bias using the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) Risk of Bias tool for animal studies (Hooijmans et al. 2014), except for item 9 (selective outcome reporting), as this was not assessed in any of the surveyed studies. The STROBE assessment (Vandenbroucke et al. 2014) was used for studies in humans, except for item 16 (main results: unadjusted estimates, confounder-adjusted estimates, category boundaries, translating estimates of relative risk into absolute risk for a meaningful period), as it was not applicable. Outcomes were expressed as the percentage of low-risk judgements (i.e., by dividing the low-risk score by the total number of judgements). When the number was below 16 points (50%), we arbitrarily defined the quality as low. When the results represented up to 60% of the maximum number of points, we treated the study as of moderate quality. Results up to and over 75% were considered high or very high quality, respectively. When a discrepancy occurred, a third author (WM) was involved (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2).

The initial search yielded 2340 hits; 2315 articles were excluded as duplicates or after evaluation at the title or abstract level. Out of 25 full-text articles that were reviewed, 15 were excluded for not fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Reasons for exclusion were review (n = 4), no microbiota analysis (n = 6), medications other than SGAs (n = 1), and full-text unavailability (n = 4), resulting in 10 articles that included 15 experiments in the systematic review (Fig. 1).

Overall, seven articles (experiments = 11) comprising 282 rodents were included: four articles had conducted the experiments using mice (n = 198; C57BL/6J) and three using rats (n = 84; Sprague–Dawley rats). Rats were of both genders (Davey et al. 2012) or females only (Davey et al. 2013; Kao et al. 2018), aged 6–8 weeks and weighing approximately 200–250 g. Female mice were either 4–8 weeks (Morgan et al. 2014) or 6–7 weeks old (Bahr et al. 2015b), and no information regarding age and gender were found in the other two mouse articles (Grobe et al. 2015; Riedl et al. 2017). Agents tested were RIS (experiments = 6, n = 150 rodents) (Grobe et al. 2015; Bahr et al. 2015b; Riedl et al. 2017) and OLZ (experiments = 5, n = 132 rodents) (Davey et al. 2012, 2013; Morgan et al. 2014) administered orally (experiments = 7, n = 185 rodents) (Morgan et al. 2014; Grobe et al. 2015; Bahr et al. 2015b) or intraperitoneally (experiments = 3, n = 84 rodents) (Davey et al. 2012, 2013).

The influence of the microbiota on the metabolic outcome was analysed using the following experimental models: antibiotic usage (experiments = 2) (Davey et al. 2013; Bahr et al. 2015b), high-fat diet (HFD) (Morgan et al. 2014), germ-free model (Morgan et al. 2014), microbiota transfer (Grobe et al. 2015), or SGA treatment prior to cecectomy (Riedl et al. 2017) (one study each). Five rodent protocols were placebo-controlled (Davey et al. 2012, 2013; Grobe et al. 2015; Bahr et al. 2015b; Kao et al. 2018), including one with a faecal transfer trial (Grobe et al. 2015), one study had a cross-sectional design (Morgan et al. 2014), and one described SGA treatment prior to sham operation (Riedl et al. 2017) (for more details, see Table
1).

Overall, three observational studies in humans (experiments = 4; n = 232) including two cross-sectional groups and two longitudinal groups were included (Bahr et al. 2015a; Flowers et al. 2017; Yuan et al. 2018), all aiming to assess whether RIS (n = 74) (Bahr et al. 2015a; Yuan et al. 2018) or mixed SGAs (n = 117) (Flowers et al. 2017) would affect the microbiota composition and, consequently, metabolic indices. One article included 33 male children (mean age: cross-sectional group, 12.2 ± 2.5 years; longitudinal group, 11.7 ± 1.1 years; no treatment, 12.0 ± 1.8 years) (Bahr et al. 2015a). In addition to chronic RIS treatment, patients were also administered psychostimulants (100%), α-2 agonists (66%), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, 11%), whereas controls did not receive antipsychotics but were taking psychostimulants (70%), α-2 agonists (30%), and SSRIs (20%). Another study involved 117 adults (study group treated with SGAs, 34 females and 12 males aged 46 ± 12 years; control group, 48 females and 21 males aged 51.7 ± 13.5 years) (Flowers et al. 2017). Co-administration of antidepressants (53%), mood stabilizers (57%), lithium (22%), and benzodiazepines (39%) was identified in SGAs and the control group. The last study evaluated RIS-induced metabolic parameters such as antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in relations to microbiota composition between drug naïve 41 schizophrenia (SCZ) patients (18 females, 23 males; mean age 23.1 ± 8 years) and healthy controls (21 females, 20 males; mean age 24.7 ± 6.7 years) (Yuan et al. 2018). For more details, see Table
2.

An analysis of the overall risk of bias in rodent studies was limited by restricted information being provided. Results were heterogeneous with randomization in three articles (60%) (Davey et al. 2012, 2013; Bahr et al. 2015b), and no information regarding potential conflicts of interest was reported in one article (20%) (Morgan et al. 2014). Other key study quality indicators were poor, and an unclear risk for most types of SYRCLE’s bias was identified (Fig. S2). The reporting quality of the human studies was low (Bahr et al. 2015a) (score 13; 40.62%) and moderate (score 17; 53.12%) (Flowers et al. 2017), but a study by Yuan et al. (Yuan et al. 2018) was found to be of relatively high quality (score 20; 62.5%). For details, see Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2.

Bacteria in stool were tested in five studies [four OLZ (Davey et al. 2012, 2013; Morgan et al. 2014; Kao et al. 2018) and one RIS study (Bahr et al. 2015b)] using widely applied 16S rRNA sequencing methods. In two OLZ studies (Davey et al. 2012; Morgan et al. 2014) information was provided regarding microbiota diversity. In one RIS study (Bahr et al. 2015b), the number of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was reported. The abundance of bacterial phyla was analysed in two OLZ studies (Davey et al. 2012, 2013) and one RIS (Bahr et al. 2015b) study, whereas bacterial classes were studied in two OLZ studies (Morgan et al. 2014; Kao et al. 2018) and bacterial genera in one RIS study (Bahr et al. 2015b). Briefly, a skewed Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was the most frequent observation of our SR, secondary to OLZ (Davey et al. 2012, 2013) and RIS (Bahr et al. 2015b) treatment. Detailed data are presented in Table
1.

Although RIS was implemented in six rodent experiments (from three articles), a microbiota analysis was performed in only one of them. An increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes (32.6%) was found with a reciprocal decrease in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (− 22.40%) in drug-treated subjects (Bahr et al. 2015b). Alistipes spp. and Lactobacillus spp. were more prevalent in control-treated rodents, whereas the population of Allobaculum spp. increased (36.5%) in the RIS group (Bahr et al. 2015b). Furthermore, SGAs were shown to possess antibacterial properties in vitro; OLZ inhibited the growth of anaerobic bacteria (Bahr et al. 2015b), and diminished the growth of Escherichia coli NC101 but not Enterococcus faecalis OGIRF cultures (Morgan et al. 2014).

In two human studies (Bahr et al. 2015a; Flowers et al. 2017), the bacteria in stools were tested using 16S rRNA sequencing methods, while in a third study (Yuan et al. 2018), the copy numbers of five bacterial genera (Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium coccoides group, Lactobacillus spp., and Bacteroides spp.) were determined by means of qPCR analysis. The difference in microbial communities between observed groups was calculated using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). One study assessed Shannon diversity (all sample species) (Bahr et al. 2015a), and another focused on Simpson (dominant species) diversity (Flowers et al. 2017). The abundance of bacterial phyla was analysed in one study (Bahr et al. 2015a), whereas bacterial families were analysed in two human studies (Bahr et al. 2015a; Flowers et al. 2017) and bacterial genera in all human studies (Bahr et al. 2015a; Flowers et al. 2017; Yuan et al. 2018). The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was reported in only the RIS study (Bahr et al. 2015a).

In a study by Yuan et al. (2018), authors found that 24-week RIS treatment was associated with a significant overall increase in the copy numbers of faecal Bifidobacterium spp. (F(3,160) = 7.298, p < 0.001; week 0, 6.72 ± 1.35 l g copies/g; week 24, 7.24 ± 0.78 l g copies/g) and Escherichia coli (F(3,160) = 8.280, p < 0.001; week 0, 7.58 ± 0.68 l g copies/g; week 24, 8.03 ± 0.66 l g copies/g). Interestingly, the copy numbers of faecal Bacteroides spp. did not change over 24 weeks of RIS treatment (F(3,160) = 2.188, p = 0.092). They also noticed that after 6 weeks of treatment, the copy numbers of Bifidobacterium spp. (at 6 weeks p < 0.05, 12, 24 weeks p < 0.001) and Escherichia coli (at 6 weeks p < 0.05, 12 p < 0.01, 24 p < 0.001) elevated. Copy numbers of Clostridium coccoides group were lower after 6 weeks of treatment (at 6 and 12 weeks p < 0.01, 24 weeks p < 0.001), and Lactobacillus spp. was decreased at 12 and 24 weeks of RIS administration (p < 0.001).

The effect of OLZ administration on body weight was measured using different experimental models in four studies (experiments = 5) including C57BL/6J female mice (experiments = 2) (Morgan et al. 2014) or both genders of Sprague–Dawley rats (experiments = 3) (Davey et al. 2012, 2013; Kao et al. 2018). The impact of RIS on body weight was determined in three studies (experiments = 6); one study included C57BL/6J female mice (Bahr et al. 2015b), and two other studies (conference abstracts) did not report mouse gender (Grobe et al. 2015; Riedl et al. 2017). We did not conduct aggregated analysis concerning body weight, due to methodological differences and various ways of expressing measured values.

In general, administration of OLZ increased body weights in female rats (Davey et al. 2013; Kao et al. 2018) and female mice (Morgan et al. 2014). This effect was dose independent in two studies (Davey et al. 2012, 2013). In one study, OLZ administration caused increased adiposity (percentage of body fat), even after correction for weight gain (Morgan et al. 2014). The body weight increases induced by OLZ was counteracted by antibiotic administration (Davey et al. 2013) and lack of bacteria (germ-free mouse model), and potentiated by an HFD (Morgan et al. 2014). The increase in body weight induced by RIS administration was not affected by antibiotics (Bahr et al. 2015b). In rodents receiving RIS, the non-aerobic resting metabolic rate (RMR) was suppressed in mice in three studies (Grobe et al. 2015; Bahr et al. 2015b; Riedl et al. 2017). One study reported no direct information regarding body weight but identified that, in RIS-treated rodents, the suppression of tRMR was not affected by cecectomy (Riedl et al. 2017). Increased fat mass and free fatty acid release and elevated expression of lipogenic enzymes were observed in 12 female rats (Davey et al. 2013). Importantly, in six female rats, administration of SGAs resulted in elevated expression of macrophage marker CD68 in adipose tissue, indicating that body weight gains were associated with recruitment of macrophages into the fat mass (Davey et al. 2013).

In 18 male children chronically treated with RIS, the BMI Z-score increased by a mean 0.31 ± 1.11 points, and the BMI Z-score increased over 10 months of treatment (mean 0.28 ± 0.23 units) in a longitudinal study arm (Bahr et al. 2015a). Flowers et al. (2017) observed higher BMI in patients receiving SGAs (31 ± 7 vs 27.5 ± 6, p = 0.006; after correcting for age and gender, p = 0.04). Yuan et al. (2018) discovered that RIS treatment caused a significant increase in weight (F(3,160) = 4.331, p = 0.006), BMI (F(3,160) = 5.025, p = 0.002), fasting serum glucose levels (F(3,160) = 5.081, p = 0.002), triglycerides (F(3,160) = 3.428, p = 0.019), LDL (F(3,160) = 3.973, p = 0.009), and HOMA-IR (F(3,160) = 10.187, p < 0.001). At a week 6 of treatment, increases in BMI (week 0, 20.54 ± 4.87 kg/m2; week 6 21.96 ± 5.36 kg/m2; p < 0.05), glucose (week 0, 4.37 ± 1.03 mmol/l; week 6, 4.63 ± 0.81 mmol/l; < 0.01), HOMA-IR (week 0, 0.97 ± 0.67; week 6, 1.39 ± 1.17; p < 0.001), and LDL (week 0, 2.22 ± 1.25 mmol/l; week 6, 2.62 ± 1.53 mmol/l; p < 0.05) were observed. At 12 and 24 weeks, all metabolic parameters mentioned above were also significantly increased (BMI—week 12, 22.54 ± 5.7 kg/m2; p < 0.01; week 24, 22.88 ± 6.97 kg/m2; p < 0.001; LDL—week 12, 2.69 ± 1.36 mmol/l; p < 0.01; week 24, 2.63 ± 1.19 mmol/l; p < 0.01). Additionally, weight increased significantly (week 12, 63.49 ± 18.94 kg, p < 0.01; week 24, 62.85 ± 19.73, p < 0.01), as well as serum triglyceride level (week 0, 0.96 ± 1.33 mmol/l; week 12, 1.28 ± 0.97 mmol/l, p < 0.01; week 24, 1.37 ± 1.37 mmol/l; p < 0.001).

No other metabolic investigations were undertaken; however, Bahr et al. (2015a) performed Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analyses and found that bacterial orthologues enriched in chronic RIS patients compared to controls were responsible for environmental information processing pathways and cellular processes, including short-chain fatty acid and tryptophan metabolism. In persons free of psychiatric treatment, there were more orthologues involved in bacterial metabolic pathways, such as vitamin metabolism. Detailed data extracted from original papers included in our systematic review are provided in Table
2.

Most studies investigating this hypothesis have been performed in different experimental models. Morgan et al. (2014), in their germ-free experiment in gnotobiotic mice, showed that the microbiota is necessary to induce metabolic changes after OLZ treatment. One experiment assumed that the relative abundance of class Erysipelotrichi, which is increased by OLZ, is linked to rapid weight gain; every 1% increase in abundance resulted in a weight gain of 0.7%. The same pattern, though more pronounced, was identified relative to the class Actinobacteria (for which an OLZ effect was not observed); every 1% increase in abundance resulted in a weight gain of almost 5% (Morgan et al. 2014). In a study by Kao et al. (2018) 2-week intraperitoneal OLZ administration in female rodents elevated body weights, and prebiotic therapy attenuated this effect. The study indicated no OLZ-induced alterations of gut microbiota which means that B-GOS supplementation may prevent weight gain independently of its influence on gut microbiota. In a rodent RIS intervention (Bahr et al. 2015b), the medication caused a significant increase in weight (2.8 g) compared to control mice, and co-administration of antibiotics had no significant effect on the weight gain. When performing microbiota transfer from RIS-treated mice, recipients had a 16% reduction in total resting metabolic rate (tRMR) due to a reduction in non-aerobic RMR. tRMR states for the largest portion of total energy need thus is relevant to describe metabolic outcomes (Astrup et al. 1999) Similarly, transfer of the phageome from RIS mice resulted in a significant weight gain in recipients relative to the vehicle study arm (p < 0.05) (37). Two studies obtained indirect data on the metabolic influence of microbiota changes following RIS treatment (Grobe et al. 2015; Riedl et al. 2017). In the study by Grobe et al. (2015), faecal transplants from RIS-treated rodents resulted in elevated body mass through non-aerobic RMR suppression, which was found to be unaffected by cecectomy (Riedl et al. 2017). Study conclusions are shown in Table
3.

In humans, the data are less clear. Bahr et al. found increased BMI Z-scores in humans treated with RIS (mean 0.31 ± 1.11 points over the treatment course), whereas in controls, the scores seemed to be unchanged (Bahr et al. 2015a). Chronic treatment with RIS and a significant gain in BMI resulted in a lower Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio compared with the control group. Moreover, differences in bacterial composition were observed in RIS-treated children who had BMI gains compared to those who did not. Detailed data concerning the association of differences in microbiota abundance depending on body weight gain are presented in Table
2. In the initial phase of RIS treatment lasting 10 months, BMI Z-scores increased a mean 0.28 ± 0.23 units, which seemed to correlate with a decreased Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio starting 1–3 months after treatment initiation (the observed result was not significant, likely due to the small sample size).

In the last human study, the authors (Yuan et al. 2018) found that at baseline Bifidobacterium spp., counts negatively correlated with serum levels of LDL and Escherichia coli count was negatively correlated with serum levels of triglycerides and hs-CRP, even after controlling for age, gender, smoking status, and disease duration. Following the treatment, a decrease in Clostridium coccoides group (since 6 weeks) and Lactobacillus spp. (since 12 weeks) and elevations in numbers of Bifidobacterium spp. (since 6 weeks) and Escherichia coli (since 6 weeks), in comparison to baseline values, were reported. When they conducted hierarchical multiple linear regression, only the differences in faecal Bifidobacterium spp. count significantly correlated with the weight changes over 24 weeks of RIS treatment (Yuan et al. 2018). A summary of the evidence from human studies is provided in Table
4.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SR investigating the effect of SGAs on intestinal microbiota in relation to frequent metabolic adverse events associated with their use in clinical practice. This SR aimed to find answers to three questions: (1) do SGAs affect intestinal microbiota resulting in dysbiosis, (2) whether SGA-related metabolic disorders are associated with dysbiosis, and finally (3) to elucidate the mechanisms behind SGA treatment and dysbiosis leading to body weight and metabolic disturbances (Fig. 2) (Delzenne et al. 2011). Although numbers of existing rodent and human studies are limited, we found that dysbiosis secondary to SGA treatment can play a role in metabolic alterations, including weight gain.

In conclusion, this systematic review proves that alterations in the gut microbiota composition causing low-level inflammation and decreased energy expenditure can play a role in body weight gain during SGA treatment. Experimental research targeting the gastrointestinal microbiota to discover the exact mechanism of SGA action associated with poor metabolic outcomes and controlled prospective human studies should be initiated and followed. We truly believe that experimental and clinical studies should include an assessment of intestinal barrier integrity, markers of the generalized inflammatory process (e.g., LPS), and the effect of gut microbiota modifications (prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics) on metabolic side effects of SGAs. Lastly, studies in the field of metabolomics should also be the next step in such experiments to. Due to individual composition and function of gut microbiota, the content of the microbiome metabolites, e.g., SCFAs or secondary bile acids, which play an important role in metabolic and cardiovascular health, would comprehensively decipher the impact of SGA-induced dysbiosis on human metabolism (Alemán et al. 2018; Chambers et al. 2018).
