Tumor Colonization and Therapy by Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 Strain in Syngeneic Tumor-Bearing Mice Is Strongly Affected by the Gut Microbiome

Cancer is a leading cause of disease-related death in humans and in domestic animals. Despite recent progress in the diagnosis and treatment of advanced cancer, the overall patient treatment outcome did not substantially improve. Bacterium-mediated cancer therapy is one promising method of cancer treatment. The most important challenges for the successful clinical use of bacteria are ensuring their preferential tumor colonization and initiating functional tumor-specific immunity. In the current work, we describe the influence of the gut microbiome on Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) strain-mediated cancer therapy in a mouse tumor model. Here we demonstrate that gut microbiome modulation can be beneficial for colonization of EcN in tumor tissues and lead to improved survival of tumor-bearing mice treated with EcN.

In the past, different bacterial species have been tested for cancer therapy in preclinical and clinical studies. The success of bacterial cancer therapy is mainly dependent on the ability of the utilized bacteria to overcome the host immune defense system to colonize the tumors and to initiate tumor-specific immunity. In recent years, several groups have demonstrated that the gut microbiome plays an important role of modulation of the host immune response and has an impact on therapeutic responses in murine models and in cohorts of human cancer patients. Here we analyzed the impact of the gut microbiome on tumor colonization and tumor therapy by the Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) strain. This EcN strain is a promising cancer therapy candidate with probiotic properties. In our study, we observed significantly better tumor colonization by EcN after antibiotic-induced temporal depletion of the gut microbiome and after two intranasal applications of the EcN derivate (EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr) in 4T1 tumor-bearing syngeneic BALB/c mice. In addition, we demonstrated significant reduction in tumor growth and extended survival of the EcN-treated mice in contrast to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated tumor-bearing control animals. Multispectral imaging of immune cells revealed that depletion of the gut microbiome led to significantly lower infiltration of cytotoxic and helper T cells (CD4 and CD8 cells) in PBS tumors of mice pretreated with antibiotics in comparison with antibiotic untreated PBS—or EcN treated mice. These findings may help in the future advancement of cancer treatment strategies using E. coli Nissle 1917.

Several bacteria, including Salmonella spp. [1], Bifidobacterium longum [2], Eschericha coli [3], Listeria monocytogenes [4] and Clostridium spp. [5,6] have been tested as anticancer agents in preclinical studies [7,8,9]. Most of these tumor-targeting bacteria were genetically modified to increase the effectiveness of cancer therapy [9,10]. Unfortunately, only a few bacterial strains have been successfully tested in human clinical trials with cancer patients. At this point, a number of Listeria vaccine strains have shown the best outcomes in cancer therapy and are currently in phase II and III clinical trials [9,11,12].

Our findings demonstrate that antibiotic-induced, temporal depletion of the gut microbiome followed by intranasally applied bacterial treatment in 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice leads to increased tumor and gut colonization with EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr as well as to significant reduction in tumor growth compared to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated tumor-bearing control animals. In addition, this microbiome depletion leads to significantly lower infiltration of cytotoxic and helper T cells (CD4 and CD8 cells), as well as dendritic cells in tumors of antibiotic-pretreated 4T1 tumor-bearing mice in comparison with antibiotic untreated and/or EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr injected mice. These immunological studies were carried out with the help of CODEX-based multiplexed immunohistochemistry analysis [33,34], which allowed us localize over 10 surface markers in one tumor tissue section. These findings may become very important for the design of new approaches that involve modulation of the gut microbiome in order to improve cancer therapy with EcN.

The bacterial strain EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr [27] is a derivate of E. coli Nissle 1917 (Ardeypharm GmbH, Herdecke, Germany) carrying a kanamycin (Kn)-resistance cassette as well as a green fluorescent protein (gfp) gene. In these experimental settings, the strain EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr was grown in Luria Bertani (LB) Broth medium (Sigma-Aldrich-L3022, Schnelldorf, Germany) containing 30 µg/mL kanamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany). Bacteria were harvested and washed with endotoxin-free, sterile PBS (Dulbecco, Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany, cat. No.: TMS-012-A) prior to injection.

The 4T1 mammary cancer cells (ATCC: CRL-2539) were cultured in DMEM medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Schnelldorf, Germany, 11965092) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma- Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany, F4135) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotic solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany, P4333) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.

The prior identity of the bacterial strain EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr was determined by PCR analysis with EcN-specific primers, as already described [13,27]. For this purpose, 100 µL overnight cultures of EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr and wild-type EcN (control) were boiled for 10 min at 100 °C and 1 µL of each culture was used as a template for PCR reactions.

The strain EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr or the wild-type EcN (control) were grown in LB Broth medium (Sigma-Aldrich-L3022, Schnelldorf, Germany) with or without kanamycin. At different time points, the optical density of the cultures was measured at 600 nm with a BioPhotometer 6131 Spectrometer (Eppendorf, Germany). For detection of green fluorescent protein (GFP), 100 µL cultures of both strains were harvested and resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer. Samples were separated by 10% SDS-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman GmbH, Dassel, Germany). After blocking in 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA: Albumin Fraktion V, Article no. 8076.4; Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) in 1x Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS; Trizma base, Article no. T1503; Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany and sodium chloride, Article no. 73575; Fluka Analytical, Munich, Germany), the membrane was incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody against green fluorescent protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany, sc-8334), The primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, ab6721) secondary antibody, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection.

For gut microbiome depletion, mice received a cocktail of four antibiotics and one antimycotic [ampicillin 1 g/L (Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany, A9518), vancomycin 0.35 g/L (Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany, V2002), neomycin 1 g/L (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany, N1876), metronidazole 1 g/L (Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany, M1547) and amphotericin B 0.1 g/L (Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany, A2942)] in their drinking water, as described in previous reports [35,36]. Amphotericin B was added to prevent fungal overgrowth. The antibiotic cocktail was administered to BALB/c mice for a period of 7 days and was replaced every other day. At days 4 and 7 after antibiotic treatment (ABT), fecal samples of antibiotic-treated mice were collected and 100 mg of fecal samples (8–12 feces) were mechanically homogenized in 1 ml sterile PBS. The fecal suspensions were then plated on LB agar (Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany, L3022), Schaedler agar with sheep blood plus hemin and vitamin K (Thermo Scientific Oxoid, Wesel, Germany, PB5034A) and Sabouraud agar (Roth, Germany, AE22.1) in doubles with 100 µL suspension on each plate. LB and Schaedler agar plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h, whereas Sabouraud agar plates were incubated at 30 °C for 72 h. The Schaedler agar plates were stored under anaerobic conditions by use of the Anaerocult A reagent (Merck kGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, Cat. No. 1.32381.0001) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the protocol approved by the Government of Upper Franconia, Germany, according to the guidelines for the welfare and use of animals in cancer research (application No.: RUF-55.2.2.-2532-2-849).

The tumors were generated by implanting 1 × 105 mammary carcinoma 4T1 cells subcutaneously into the right dorsal flank regions of 5- to 6-week-old female BALB/c mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany). After tumor cell implantation, the mice were randomized and divided into four groups. Tumor growth was determined with a digital caliper at least two times per week. Tumor volume was calculated by use of the modified ellipsoid formula [(length × width2)/2]. When tumors reached 100–250 mm3, the mice (n  =  5 mice per group) were injected intranasally (i.n.) twice, either with EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr (1 × 107 CFU/15 µL PBS/ mice) or with PBS (control, 15 µL PBS/ mice) for a three-day interval. During this time, mice were monitored for changes in body weight as well as signs of toxicity. Mice that developed tumors with volumes greater than 1500 mm3 were euthanized as requested by the animal protocol.

Fecal samples were collected for 18 days after EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr injection. At different time points, about 8–12 feces (~100 mg) were mechanically homogenized in 1 mL sterile PBS. The fecal suspensions were then plated on LB agar plates supplemented with 30 µg/mL kanamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany, B5264) and analyzed for EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr presence.

To determine bacterial load in tumor tissues, mice were euthanized and the tumors were excised, weighed and homogenized in sterile PBS. The homogenates were serially diluted and plated on LB agar plates containing 30 µg/mL kanamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany, B5264). Resultant colonies were counted and the bacterial numbers were calculated as CFU per 1 g tumor tissue.

For histological studies of different treated 4T1 tumor-bearing syngeneic BALB/c mice, tumors were excised, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (Sakura Finetek Europe, Netherlands). Tissue samples were sectioned (7 µm thickness) with the cryostat CM3050 S (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). The tumor samples were first fixed and labeled/stained using anti-mouse CODEX barcode-conjugated antibodies (Table 1) and analyzed by the CODEX system (Akoya Biosciences, Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (CODEX User Manual, Chapter 5, page 42).

The fluorescence-labeled tissue samples were imaged using a BZ-X800 fluorescence microscope (Keyence, Osaka, Japan), equipped with the BZ-X800 Analyzer software (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Finally, the raw data were processed using the CODEX processor software (AKOYA Bioscience, Marlborough, MA, USA), and analyzed with the QuPath vo. 3.2 software (https://qupath.github.io/, accessed on 15 July 2022. The statistical analysis was done using Microsoft Excel software.

The significance of the results was calculated by Student’s t-test, and the Kaplan–Meier and log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests. The comparison of CFUs between different treated groups was statistically evaluated in R with the function “wilcox.test” (https://www.r-project.org/, accessed on 6 July 2021). Results are displayed as means ± standard deviation (SD), p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Asterisks indicate a significant difference between experimental groups (* indicates p < 0.05; ** indicates p < 0.01; *** indicates p < 0.001).

E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) carries two naturally occurring plasmids pMUT1 and pMUT2, which have no known function, but both plasmids are stable within these bacteria [37]. For the construction of EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr, the EcN strain was first cured of both plasmids pMUT1 and pMUT2 and then transformed with plasmid DNA pMUT2 carrying a Kn-resistance cassette as well as the gfp gene under the control of a constitutive promoter [27]. In the first step of our study, we validated the identity and the plasmid stability of the EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr strain in cultures grown with and without kanamycin selection by PCR and resistance to kanamycin (Figure 1A,B). The PCR analyses with EcN-specific primers (Table 2) showed the expected plasmid and chromosomal EcN patterns and the absence of the plasmid pMUT1 in the EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr strain compared to the wild-type EcN (Figure 1AII, line 1 vs. line 2). In addition, the plasmid pMUT-gfp Knr was stable in both overnight EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr cultures grown with and without kanamycin. Our analyses also demonstrated that less than 10% of EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr bacteria lost kanamycin resistance after 20 generations without antibiotic selection (Figure 1B).

Two independent fecal samples of 8–12 feces (approximately 100 mg) were collected at different time points. The number of microorganisms were analyzed as described in materials and methods (Section 2.3.); n.d.: not detected.

Further, the toxicity of the bacterial therapy and the survival efficiency were analyzed by monitoring the tumor volume and the weight of mice (Figure 2C,D). With the exception of the first three days of treatment, all four mice groups showed similar mean weights over the course of this study (Figure 2C). There were no signs of bacterial or antibiotic-mediated distress. All EcN-treated mice (i.e., antibiotic-treated and untreated) displayed significantly enhanced survival, compared to PBS-treated animals (Figure 2D). Moreover, no mice from bacterium-treated groups developed tumors with volumes greater than the maximum allowable volume (1500 mm3) at 18 days post-bacterium injection (dpbi). Therefore, we terminated the animal experiments at this time point in order to analyze the presence of EcN bacteria in mice and investigate the possible role of host immune responses.

In order to study the effects of antibiotic-induced gut microbiome depletion, we first compared bacterial colonization in the tumor tissues of mice without and with antibiotic pretreatment (ABT) at the last time point of EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr treatment (Table 4).

The data were determined by standard CFU assays on LB agar plates with 30 µg/mL kanamycin using aliquots of homogenized tumors. For each tumor, two aliquots of 100 µL were analyzed and the data were displayed as mean cfu ± standard deviation (SD) per 1 g tumor tissue. ABT—antibiotic-pretreated mouse; n.d.: not detected.

It seems to be that antibiotic pretreatment may prevent a rapid elimination of EcN from tumors and/or allow better bacterial delivery in tumor tissues. Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion has a positive effect on EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr replication and survival in tumor tissues.

The presence and persistence of EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr in fecal samples of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice was analyzed at different days during tumor treatment (Table 5).

Two independent fecal samples of 8–12 feces (approximately 100 mg) for each group of mice (n  =  5 mice per group), were homogenized in 1 mL sterile PBS at day 11 or day 18 post-bacterial injection (dpbi). Aliquots (100 µL) of each homogenized sample were plated on LB agar plates containing 30 µg/mL kanamycin. Resultant colonies were counted and the data displayed as mean cfu ± standard deviation (SD) per 100 mg feces. * ABT—antibiotic-pretreated mice group. n.d.: not detected.

Our data revealed that a temporal microbiome depletion leads to longer survival of the intranasally applied EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr bacteria in the gut as noted by analyses of the feces.

In contrast, significantly lower infiltration of DCs (population of CD45, CD11c and MHCII positive cells) was found in the tumors of antibiotic-pretreated PBS mice in comparison with antibiotic-untreated mice after EcN injections. (Figure 5). In addition, significantly lower infiltration of cytotoxic and helper T cells (CD4 and CD8 cells) was also associated with the antibiotic pretreatment (ABT PBS mice), but not in response to EcN. (Figure 6 and Figure 7). In these analyses we used the combination of CD3, CD4 and CD8 antibodies for staining and identification of subsets of T lymphocytes (Figure 7). However, the mechanism of how the number of DCs and T cells in the tumor tissue may have influenced E. coli Nissle-mediated antitumor therapeutic efficacy is currently unknown.

In this study, we investigated the impact of the gut microbiome on the anti-tumor activity of the E. coli Nissle 1917 derivative, EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr, in a 4T1 tumor-bearing syngeneic BALB/c mouse model. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated that cancer therapy can be enhanced and improved by modulation of the gut microbiome [31,39,40]. The gut microbiome has an influence on several important host functions, which include nutrient acquisition, organ development and immune modulation [41,42]. Here we significantly reduced the gut microorganisms by antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion with an antibiotic cocktail consisting of four antibiotics and one antimycotic compound for a period of at least 7 days. Throughout the intranasally delivered bacterial therapy, we compared the antitumor effects of the EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr strain with or without antibiotic pretreatment. In our experimental setting, we preferred the intranasal route of bacterial application. In that way, we hoped to avoid possible complications through oral bacterial application and oral antibiotic treatment as well as subsequent effects of microorganism’s lysis within the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, it is known that the intranasal route of administration of EcN is more efficient than the oral route and leads to the persistence of these E. coli bacteria in the gut of healthy mice [43]. Our data showed that, after temporal antibiotic-induced depletion of the gut microbiome, the presence of EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr bacteria in tumor tissues was significantly higher (about 50-fold) than in tumors of antibiotic-untreated mice (Table 4). One possible reason for this finding may be that microbiome depletion modulates the immune system and probably affects nutrient acquisition in tumor-bearing mice. Stritzker et al. already reported that the depletion of macrophages results in elevated EcN colonization in tumor tissue, while bacterial strains defective for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis show increased tumor specificity [23]. Therefore, to be sure that the host immune system is still functional after microbiome depletion, we analyzed major immune cell phenotypes including subsets of antigen presentig cells (mainly dendritic cells and macrophages), B and T lymphocytes in the tumor tissue on the last day of EcN or PBS treatment by multiplexed immunohistochemistry. Compared to FACS analysis, the method does not require cell isolation that may result in variable cell loss and retains the tumor structure allowing for spatial analysis of tumor [44]. Our data revealed that antibiotic pretreatment led to strongly reduction on the number of microorganisms in gut (Table 3) and significantly lower infiltration of T cells in the tumors of ABT PBS-treated mice in comparison with PBS or EcN-treated groups (Figure 6 and Figure 7). Interestingly, intranasal applications of EcN in antibiotic-pretreated and untreated mice led to significantly increased numbers of CD3+CD4+ T-cells (possible Th1 T helper cells) and CD3+CD8+ (cytotoxic T cells) in comparison with ABT PBS-treated mice. This could be evidence that E. coli Nissle infection stimulates T cell infiltration in the tumor tissue. Moreover, a Th1 response was observed in mice after E. coli Nissle infection [45] and such a Th1 response leads to tumor growth inhibition in the 4T1 mouse tumor model [46]. In addition, significantly lower DCs infiltration was found in the tumors of antibiotic-pretreated PBS mice in comparison with antibiotic-untreated mice after EcN injections only. However, until now, the mechanism of E. coli Nissle-mediated antitumor effects has not been fully understood. It is possible that the presence of EcN in tumor tissue may elicit the host immune response against the tumor and/or induce changes in the tumor microenvironment—leading to antitumor effects [22,26,47]. In this study, EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr treatment resulted in a statistically significant inhibition of tumor growth compared to PBS controls, but did not result in complete tumor regressions (Figure 2B). However, our findings demonstrate that temporary depletion of the gut microbiome may have a positive effect on EcN tumor colonization and replication. Here, the microbiome depletion led to the significantly extended survival of EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr in the tumor tissue and longer persistence in gut (Table 4 and Table 5). The mechanism for this phenomenon is still unknown, but antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion had no direct effect on EcN-mediated antitumor efficacy under these experimental conditions. On the other hand, enhanced tumor colonization or longer persistence of EcN in the host may be beneficial for targeted cancer therapies and the delivery of antitumor drugs [10,48].

Thus, the combination of EcN-mediated tumor therapy and microbiome modulation may be a fruitful, novel option for enhancing multiple forms of cancer therapy in general.

The significant incidence and mortality associated with cancers continue to challenge modern medicine to develop more reliable therapies. One of the most promising novel cancer therapies is bacterium-mediated cancer therapy. This method is mainly based on the capability of bacteria to preferentially target cancer tissue and to initiate tumor-specific immunity. Until now, several different bacterial species have been tested with convincing results in preclinical and clinical studies. In the current study, we demonstrated for the first time that microbiome modulation could be helpful for the extended survival of EcN/pMUT-gfp Knr in the tumor tissue and significantly improved survival of the EcN-treated, tumor-bearing mice. On the basis of these data, we propose that microbiome modulation may become a new option for enhancing bacterium-mediated cancer therapies.
