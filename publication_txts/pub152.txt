Recipe for a Healthy Gut: Intake of Unpasteurised Milk Is Associated with Increased Lactobacillus Abundance in the Human Gut Microbiome

Introduction: The gut microbiota plays a role in gut–brain communication and can influence psychological functioning. Diet is one of the major determinants of gut microbiota composition. The impact of unpasteurised dairy products on the microbiota is unknown. In this observational study, we investigated the effect of a dietary change involving intake of unpasteurised dairy on gut microbiome composition and psychological status in participants undertaking a residential 12-week cookery course on an organic farm. Methods: Twenty-four participants completed the study. The majority of food consumed during their stay originated from the organic farm itself and included unpasteurised milk and dairy products. At the beginning and end of the course, participants provided faecal samples and completed self-report questionnaires on a variety of parameters including mood, anxiety and sleep. Nutrient intake was monitored with a food frequency questionnaire. Gut microbiota analysis was performed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, faecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured. Results: Relative abundance of the genus Lactobacillus increased significantly between pre- and post-course time points. This increase was associated with participants intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products. An increase in the faecal SCFA, valerate, was observed along with an increase in the functional richness of the microbiome profile, as determined by measuring the predictive neuroactive potential using a gut–brain module approach. Conclusions: While concerns in relation to safety need to be considered, intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products appear to be associated with the growth of the probiotic bacterial genus, Lactobacillus, in the human gut. More research is needed on the effect of dietary changes on gut microbiome composition, in particular in relation to the promotion of bacterial genera, such as Lactobacillus, which are recognised as being beneficial for a range of physical and mental health outcomes.

A growing body of evidence over the past decade has demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiome in all aspects of physical and mental health. While it is still unclear what exactly constitutes a ‘healthy’ gut microbiome, certain bacterial groups have been strongly associated with better health outcomes. Lactobacillus is one of the foremost genera considered to have probiotic properties [1]. A probiotic is defined as a live microorganism which, when administered in adequate amounts, confers a health benefit on the host [2]. The word ‘psychobiotic’ is an expansion of this term and describes an organism that has been proven to be beneficial in relation to psychological functioning [3]. There have been a wide variety of studies undertaken in recent years that have demonstrated the benefit of a Lactobacillus probiotic, both mono- and multi-strain, for improving a range of health outcomes, including obesity [4], diabetes [5], liver disease [6], cardiovascular disease [7], gastrointestinal conditions [8] and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety and autism [9].

Despite food safety concerns, the consumption of unpasteurised milk appears to be growing in popularity [19,20]. To our knowledge, there are no studies exploring the impact of unpasteurised milk intake on the gut microbiome. In this observational study, we investigated the effect of a dietary change involving the intake of unpasteurised milk on gut microbiota composition, metabolites and psychological status in 24 participants undertaking a residential, farm-based, 12-week cookery course. Our centre had previously published a study [21] on the microbiota composition of unpasteurised milk taken from Irish cows, which would thus be representative of the expected microbiota composition of the raw milk that would be consumed by participants in our study. Given the reported high proportion of viable probiotic bacteria such as Lactobacillus (and other LAB such as Lactococcus and Leuconostoc), along with the fact that Lactobacillus are considered intrinsically resistant to gastric acid [22], we hypothesised that a dietary change involving raw milk consumption would alter the gut microbiome of participants with a potential differential increase in the relative abundance of these probiotic bacterial groups.

Ballymaloe Cookery School, Organic Farm and Gardens is located in East Cork, Ireland, and runs bi-annual 12-week residential courses where students live on-site, learn about organic farming methods and undertake intensive cookery classes. The majority of food consumed by participants during their stay originates from the organic farm itself or consists of high-quality, locally-sourced produce. The farm has a small herd of Jersey cows whose milk is used in its raw unpasteurised state for direct consumption, cooking and the production of other dairy products including cream, butter, cheese and yoghurt. There is an emphasis on eating, and cooking with, local seasonal fruit and vegetables, the vast majority of which is organic. Meat and fish are also locally sourced and, for the most part, organic.

Approval of the study protocol was granted by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals (Protocol number DOP001) and conducted following the ICH Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice, and the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before study procedures were conducted. Course participants were emailed in advance informing them of the study and a short talk on the gut microbiome was given at an introductory session prior to commencement of the course. In order to be eligible for the study, participants had to be between the age of 18–65 years and be generally healthy, with no chronic or current, physical or mental illness. Exclusion criteria included the use of medications that were likely to interfere with the objectives of the study (including any psychotropic medications) as well as intake of antibiotics, probiotics or prebiotics within the month prior to commencement of the study.

Demographic data was collected for each individual including information on age, sex and race. Weight and height were measured and used to calculate body mass index (BMI). Information in relation to medical and psychiatric history, along with medication use, was also obtained at interview. At the beginning and end of the 12-week course participants completed self-report questionnaires on a variety of parameters including mood, anxiety, sleep, exercise (PSS, HADS, PSQI, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)).

To monitor nutrient intake, participants completed the self-administered 152-item SLAN-06 (Survey of Lifestyle, Attitudes and Nutrition in Ireland) food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) [23], which is validated to be used in an Irish population. An additional eight food items as well as questions about type and frequency of milk, salt and fried food consumption were added. These items are included in the EPIC Norfolk questionnaire [24] from which the SLAN-06 FFQ was adapted. An extra section was added to the FFQ by the authors to quantify the intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products before and during the course, as this information would not otherwise have been captured. These extra questions followed the same response format as the other food items.

The 160 foods items were grouped into 29 food groups (e.g., fruits, vegetables, grains, sweets) using methods similar to those described in previous studies of dietary patterns [26]. To estimate the number of servings of any food group, each response was converted to the corresponding frequency factor and summed over all the food items to get the average servings of a specific food group per day. Intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products was analysed in a similar way.

Faecal samples were collected at the beginning and end of the 12-week period in disposable plastic containers with a Thermo Scientific™ Oxoid AnaeroGen 2.5 L Sachet in situ to generate anaerobic conditions within the container. Participants were instructed to keep the sample containers in a refrigerator at 4 °C. Samples were collected and transferred to a −80 °C freezer within 12 h.

DNA was extracted using the DNA Fast Stool DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilton, Germany) using the protocol for Gram positive bacteria and including an additional bead beating step at the beginning of the procedure. DNA was quantified using the Qubit High Sensitivity Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), standardised and then used as a template for PCR. 16S metagenomic libraries were prepared using primers to amplify the V3–V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, with Illumina adaptors incorporated as described in the Illumina 16S Metagenomic Library Preparation guide. Following index PCR and purification, the products were quantified using the Qubit high sensitivity DNA kit (Life Technologies) and pooled equimolarly. The pooled libraries were assessed using an Agilent high sensitivity DNA kit and examined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using the Kapa Quantification kit for Illumina (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Libraries were then diluted and denatured following Illumina guidelines and sequenced (2 × 300 bp) on the Illumina MiSeq platform.

Three hundred base pair paired-end reads were prefiltered based on a quality score threshold of >28 and trimmed, filtered for quality and chimaeras using the DADA2 library in R (version 3.6.3, Vienna, Austria) [27]. Taxonomy was assigned with DADA2 against the SILVA SSURef database release v132. Parameters as recommended in the DADA2 manual were adhered to unless mentioned otherwise. ASVs were cut off at genus level, those that were unknown on the genus level were not considered in downstream analysis, as were genera that were only detected as non-zero in five per cent or fewer of total samples.

The concentration of SCFAs, acetate, propionate, Iso-butyrate, butyrate, Iso-valerate, and valerate were analysed by gas chromatography flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) using a Varian 3800 GC system, fitted with a guard column (Restek) connected to an Agilent DB-FFAP column (30 mL × 0.3 m ID × 0.25 μm df) and a flame ionisation detector with a CP-8400 auto-sampler.

Statistical analysis for changes in dietary measures was performed using SPSS Statistical Packages version 25 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Normality of outcome measures were assessed using Shapiro Wilk’s test of normality. Differences in nutrient and food group intake pre- and post-course participation were analysed using Student’s t-test or the non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank sum test.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on centred-log ratio transformed (clr) values using the ALDEx2 library [29]. Number of permutations was always set to 1000. Aitchison distance was used as a distance metric for beta-diversity. Piphillin [30] was used for functional inference from 16S rRNA gene sequences of stool samples in the form of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologues. Gut–brain modules were calculated using the R version of the Gomixer tool [31]. Differential abundance of microbes between groups was assessed using the ALDEx2 library. As part of testing for correlations between microbial abundance and metadata, skadi, an implementation of jackknifing and Grubb’s test, was used to assess the reliability of the data and detect outliers (R scripts available online, https://github.com/thomazbastiaanssen/Tjazi; [32]). Correlation was assessed using Spearmans’s rank correlation coefficient. The relationship between categorical variables was assessed using Pearson’s Chi-squared test. For datasets in which the condition of normality was violated, the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test was used and post-hoc analysis was done using the Wilcoxon test. A p-value of <0.05 was deemed significant. To correct for multiple testing in tests correlating volatility and specific microbiota, KEGG orthologues or pathways, the Q-value post-hoc procedure was performed with a q-value of 0.1 as a cut-off [33].

A total of 62 participants who were completing the 12-week course between May and July 2018 were informed about the study. Twenty-eight participants volunteered and underwent screening. Two were excluded; one had a chronic gastrointestinal disorder and another had taken antibiotics in the previous month. Twenty-six participants were enrolled with 24 (13 females, 11 males) completing the study; 2 failed to provide faecal samples. Of note, subject metadata and faecal samples were collected within the first three days of the course and again at week 11. The final week of the course (week 12) involved several examinations for students, and thus, the associated increased stress during this week may have had the potential to influence findings. Baseline characteristics of participants, including age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, sleep quality and exercise levels are shown in Table 1.

Based on food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) analysis (Table 2 and Table 3), there was no change in total calorie intake during the course. In terms of macronutrient intake, protein and carbohydrate intake remained unchanged, and though total fat consumption increased, this change did not reach statistical significance (mean increase (g) from 94 ± 35 to 128 ± 66, p = 0.08). With regards to micronutrients, Vitamin A (µg) intake increased significantly (715 ± 577 to 1505 ± 975, p = 0.005) as did Vitamin B12 (µg) (7.8 ± 3.6 to 11 ± 5.8, p = 0.04). Although intake of fruit reduced slightly (2.02 ± 1.2 to 1.38 ± 0.84, p = 0.04), consumption of vegetables and wholegrains did not change, nor did intake of alcohol or unhealthy foods such as sweets or snacks.

Participants intake of milk and dairy products are summarised in Table 4. In relation to participants overall intake of milk, this did not change during the course (mean increase from 177 ± 120 mls to 192 ± 134 mls, p = 0.60). However, a switch to unpasteurised milk was evident for most participants. Only one of 24 (4%) participants reported consuming unpasteurised milk prior to commencing the residential course while 23 participants (96%) reported its consumption during the course (mean increase from 23 ± 116 mls to 239 ± 51 mls, p < 0.0001). Pre-course, 3 participants consumed skimmed milk, 7 semi-skimmed, 11 whole and 3 non-specific and post-course only one participant consumed semi-skimmed while the remaining participants consumed whole milk, consistent with unpasteurised milk intake. Total intake of dairy products (cream, yoghurt, dairy desserts, cheese; salad cream or mayonnaise, butter, cottage cheese) did increase slightly though not to a statistically significant level (mean increase from 2.24 ± 1.23 daily servings to 3.35 ± 3.16, p = 0.07). Two participants (8%) reported the intake of unpasteurised dairy products prior to the course whereas 21 (87.5%) consumed these products during the course (mean increase from 0.01 ± 0.04 servings per day to 1.2 ± 1.4, p < 0.0001).

We quantified the microbial diversity within each subject (
α
-diversity) before and after the course, and the difference between each subject’s pre-course and post-course gut microbiota (
β
-diversity). No significant differences were found in either
α
-diversity (Simpson; p = 0.41, Shannon; p = 0.26) or
β
-diversity (p = 0.998) (Figure 1B,C). No differences were found between males and females.

We directly tested for associations between changes in dietary components and changes in microbiome composition within each subject over time. We observed a positive correlation between Lactobacillus abundance and combined intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products (Spearman correlation, r = 0.618, p = 0.0000027). Upon closer inspection, Lactobacillus abundance appeared to fall into two groups based on the centred log-ratio (clr) transformation of relative abundance scores of >2.5 or <2.5, prompting us to dichotomise the data for Pearson’s Chi-squared test. We defined these groups as low versus high Lactobacillus abundance and found a positive association between these two groups and the change in intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products (combined score), binned into four groups based on the amount of portions consumed; 0–2, 3–4, 5–6 and 7–8. (Pearson’s Chi-squared, X-squared = 13.265, df = 3, p-value = 0.004096) (Figure 2). This association also held when looking at the relationship between Lactobacillus abundance and unpasteurised milk or unpasteurised dairy products individually. We analysed this Lactobacillus grouping against our other metadata (including age, sex, BMI, sleep, exercise and gastrointestinal parameters) but found no other factors associated with the high versus low split.

Functional analysis of our microbiome data was performed using Piphillin [30] and further extended by subjecting our metagenomic data to a module-based analytical framework, which targets microbial pathways involved in microbiota-gut-brain communication, thus generating a prediction of the neuroactive potential of a microbiome sample [34]. Within our sample, we observed 43 of the 56 gut-brain modules (GBMs) described previously by the authors. In addition, we observed an increase in the functional richness of the microbiome profile, as determined by the number of gut–brain modules (GBMs) present (Wilcoxon signed rank test; mean increase of 1.79, p = 0.00087) following the 12-week course (Figure 3A). On analysis of the individual GBMs, one consistently increased significantly; GBM026: Nitric oxide synthesis II (nitrite reductase) (p = 0.001; q = 0.061) (Figure 3B). Notably, GBM004: Kynurenine synthesis was never found in participants pre-course, but was detected in 6 out of 24 participants post-course at very high levels. This observation did not pass the post-hoc correction (p = 0.036, q = 0.361) (Figure 3C). Functional alpha diversity, measured here by calculating the alpha diversity of the floored KEGG Orthologue tables generated by Piphillin, did not differ between pre- and post-course time points (chao1; p = 0.14, Simpson; p = 0.19, Shannon; p = 0.85).

Analysis of faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) revealed a significant increase in Valerate (p = 0.049) over the 12 weeks. Propionate also increased, although not to a statistically significant level (p = 0.08) while no change was observed in butyrate, iso-butyrate, iso-valerate or acetate (Table 5).

p-values reaching statistical significance are in bold and accompanied by an asterisk. SD: Standard deviation.

There was no change in total scores on the Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)-total score, HADS-anxiety subscale, HADS-depression subscale or Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) sleep quality score between pre- and post-course time points. However, because our study involved a healthy population, baseline anxiety and stress scores were low and mood scores were within the normal range. (Table 6) Further analysis was considered taking into account baseline scores. The sample was dichotomised based on the median score of the above scales. Participants with higher baseline scores on the PSS showed a mean reduction of 4.42 points, whereas the rest of the participants reported a mean increase of 1 point (Mann–Whitney U test, p = 0.026) between pre-course and post course time points. Participants with higher anxiety scores than the median on the HADS-A also showed a statistically significant reduction compared to the rest of the participants (mean reduction of 2.11 vs. a mean increase of 2.25, Mann–Whitney U test, p = 0.004). We did not find any relationship between microbes and psychological scales. No differences were found between males and females.

In this observational study, we investigated the effect of a dietary change on the gut microbiome of participants who undertook a 12-week residential cookery course on an organic farm, where the majority of food consumed and used for cooking, was locally-sourced, seasonal and produced using organic methods. Of particular interest was the use of unpasteurised milk and dairy products obtained from a small herd of Jersey cows on the farm. Most participants had not been using any unpasteurised dairy prior to the course and all used these products to some degree throughout their stay. We found that the main change in terms of microbiome composition was a dramatic increase in the participants’ Lactobacilli between pre-course and post-course faecal samples. This increase was strongly associated with the participants’ intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products. In addition, a positive change was noted in relation to microbiome metabolites with an increase in valerate and, to a lesser extent not quite reaching statistical significance, propionate.

There are several limitations to our study. Firstly, this was an observational study. While of course an RCT would be preferable, there are many challenges inherent in designing RCTs involving dietary interventions. It can be difficult to define appropriate control groups and effective blinding of participants and investigators is often extremely difficult [88]. In particular, it can be challenging to accomplish a high level of adherence with whole food, or dietary pattern, interventions. A major strength of our study in this regard was that our participants were based on-site for the entire duration of the study making it possible to ensure a consistency across individual diets, which would be difficult to achieve outside a residential setting. The potential confounding effect of the farm environment as an independent modulator of microbiome composition is addressed earlier in the discussion. Secondly, our sample size was quite small. However, previously published studies investigating the diet–microbiome relationship have involved participant numbers of ten or less [43,89] and have generally been of much shorter duration [11]. Another factor that may limit the generalizability of our study was that participants undertaking this course were interested in food and cooking. Thus, they were likely to have good nutritional knowledge and possibly healthier than average diets at baseline. A specific limitation in this regard was an absence of any information on the use of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS). These are being increasingly used due to the concern about the negative health impact of high-sugar diets and have been shown to significantly, and generally negatively, impact the gut microbiome [90]. Finally, given the limitations of 16S rRNA gene sequencing we were unable to characterise organisms beyond the genus level. More accurate taxonomic classification would have been useful had shotgun metagenomic sequencing been performed. Despite these limitations, this is, to our knowledge, the first study to report on the potential impact of unpasteurised milk and dairy products on the human gut microbiome.

While there are understandable concerns in relation to potential contamination and safety when it comes to unpasteurised milk, it is a rich source of probiotic bacteria. Abundances of Lactobacilli increased significantly following a 12-week dietary change, which involved the consumption of unpasteurised milk and dairy products by participants. Lactococcus abundance also increased, although to a lesser extent. These changes in microbiome composition were reflected by an increase in levels of the SCFA, valerate with an observed trend towards an increase of propionate, along with an increase in the predicted functional richness of the microbiome. While there was no overall change in psychological measures, stress and anxiety scores did decrease in those with higher baseline scores. Given the growing appreciation of the importance of a healthy gut microbiome and the limitations of commercial probiotic products, there is a need for further research into the effect of different dietary changes on the microbiome and subsequent mental health. In particular, the consumption of raw milk and other probiotic-rich fermented foods is growing in popularity and it is important that the effect of such products on the gut microbiome are investigated.
