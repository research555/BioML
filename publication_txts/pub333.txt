Lack of Effect of Gluten Challenge on Fecal Microbiome in Patients With Celiac Disease and Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity

Celiac disease (CD) may be associated with gut microbial dysbiosis. Whether discrete gluten exposure in subjects with well-controlled disease on a gluten-free diet impacts the gut microbiome is unknown and may have implications for understanding disease activity and symptoms. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the impact of gluten exposure on the gut microbiome in patients with CD and nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS).

Subjects with CD (n = 9) and NCGS (n = 8) previously on a gluten-free diet were administered a 14-day gluten challenge (5 g of gluten per day) and compared with controls (n = 8) on a usual gluten-containing diet. Stool was collected for fecal microbiome analysis using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing before, during, and after the gluten challenge. Symptoms were assessed using 2 validated clinical scales.

Among subjects with CD and NCGS, there were no significant fecal microbial changes in response to gluten challenge. Gut microbiome composition differed among controls, subjects with CD, and subjects with NCGS at baseline, and these differences persisted despite gluten exposure. Gastrointestinal and general health symptoms reported by subjects with CD and NCGS were worst in the middle of gluten challenge and lessened by its end, with no consistent associations with gut microbiome composition.

Pre-existing fecal microbiome diversity was unaffected by gluten challenge in adult subjects with CD and NCGS. These findings suggest that current microbiome status is unrelated to current disease activity and disease severity.

Celiac disease (CD) is a multisystem autoimmune disease triggered by ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals and is treated by avoidance of dietary gluten (1). Another condition, nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), describes patients who develop symptoms—such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, or nausea—in response to gluten intake, but do not carry serologic or histologic markers of CD (2). In patients with CD and NCGS observing a gluten-free diet, there is wide variation in symptoms and, in CD, degree of biomarker recurrence that develops in response to gluten exposure, ranging from negligible to severe.

In this study, we investigated the impact of gluten exposure on gut microbiome composition among a clinic-based cohort of patients with CD and NCGS compared with controls. We hypothesized that a 14-day gluten challenge would alter gut microbiome composition in subjects with CD and NCGS and that symptom severity in response to gluten challenge would be associated with microbiome composition.

We performed a prospective study in which patients with CD and NCGS maintaining a long-term gluten-free diet were given a 14-day gluten challenge in parallel with controls, who remained on a nonrestrictive, gluten-containing diet (Figure
1). Stool sample collection for gut microbiome analysis and symptom assessments were performed before, during, and after the gluten challenge or corresponding period for the controls. We characterized baseline differences, stability over time, and response to gluten challenge of the gut microbiome and correlation of the gut microbiome with clinical symptoms in patients with CD and NCGS.

Adult subjects 18 years and older were included in the study. All subjects with CD (n = 9) and subjects with NCGS (n = 8) were recruited by their physicians at the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University, New York, New York, and control subjects (n = 8) were recruited through fliers posted at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Four other study participants with CD were enrolled but did not complete the study because of severe symptoms at the outset of gluten challenge (n = 2) or loss to follow-up (n = 2). CD diagnosis was based on intestinal biopsy performed as standard care before study screening. NCGS was defined by the presence of gastrointestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms that improved on cessation of gluten ingestion, with negative genetic, serologic, or duodenal histologic testing for celiac disease while on a gluten-containing diet. Controls had no clinical history of gluten intolerance or intestinal disease. Exclusion criteria included a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, hospitalization in the 2 months before study enrollment, history of severe symptomatic response to gluten exposure, or use of antibiotics, corticosteroids, or probiotics (at least once per week) in the 3 months before study enrollment. Baseline clinical characteristics were compared among the 3 study groups using ANOVA for continuous variables and the χ2 test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables.

This study was approved by the Columbia University Irving Medical Center Institutional Review Board.

The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS; AstraZeneca, East Hartford, CT) is a validated clinical rating scale for describing patient-reported gastrointestinal symptoms across 5 symptom dimensions, with higher score indicating more severe symptoms. The RAND 36-Item Health Survey 1.0 short-form survey (SF-36; RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA) is a validated questionnaire assessing patient-reported outcomes in 8 health domains, with lower score indicating more severe symptoms (10). At timepoints 2, 3, and 4, the total number of symptom dimensions (GSRS) or health domains (SF-36) indicating worsening, improving, or unchanged severity compared with timepoint 1 was assessed, with each of the symptom complexes weighted equally. Subjects were considered to have high (more severe) overall symptoms for a given timepoint if the number of worsened symptom complexes exceeded the number of symptom complexes that improved and/or were unchanged compared with baseline timepoint 1 and considered to have low overall symptoms otherwise.

Symptom severity within each study group at timepoints 2, 3, and 4 was compared with timepoint 1 using t tests with P value adjusted for multiple comparisons.

Study subjects collected stool specimens at each of the prespecified timepoints. Stool was submitted within 24 hours of collection and stored as unprocessed aliquots at –80oC.

DNA was extracted from thawed stool samples using the Qiagen MagAttract PowerSoil Kit. The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was polymerase chain reaction amplified using standard primers with overhang for Nextera XT index adapters (Illumina, San Diego CA) (11). Final libraries were quantitated using Quant-iT Broad Range dsDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and were sequenced on the MiSeq platform to achieve 300-bp paired-ended reads, yielding an average of 37,890 reads per sample. Analysis was performed using Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm version 2 (DADA2) v1.10.1 and R version 3.6.1 (12). DADA2 was used for quality filtering, trimming, error correction, chimeric sequence removal, and generation of the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) table. Each ASV was classified using the Greengenes 97% reference database. ASVs composing on average less than 0.05% of relative abundance were removed. Alpha diversity (Shannon index) and beta diversity (unweighted UniFrac, weighted UniFrac, and Bray-Curtis) were determined using the phyloseq v1.30.0 package in R (13). Differences in alpha diversity were compared across disease group and across timepoints using a pairwise Kruskal-Wallis test. Beta diversity was visualized using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), with differences tested using permutational analysis of variance (PERMONVA) using the R package, vegan v2.5.6 (14). Differentially abundant taxa were identified using DESeq2 after false discovery rate adjustment for multiple comparisons of the P values (15). Bacterial DNA sequences are publicly available in the NCBI Sequencing Read Archive (SRA) (Accession number PRJNA778253).

The same extracted DNA was used to create shotgun metagenomics libraries on select samples using the Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep kit (Illumina) according to the standard protocol while using the minimum number of cycles for polymerase chain reaction amplification. Samples from subjects with CD and NCGS at timepoints 1 and 3, immediately before and after gluten challenge, were selected because these were expected to best demonstrate changes to the gut microbiome in response to gluten exposure. Libraries were quantitated using Quant-iT Broad Range dsDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and fragment length was validated using the 2,100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with a High-Sensitivity DNA Chip. Sequencing was performed on the NextSeq platform to generate 150-bp single-ended reads. Raw reads were filtered to remove low-quality reads and adapters using Trim Galore version 0.6.4. After quality control filtering, the average read count per sample was approximately 4.4 million reads with no samples reaching below 2.5 million reads. Use of shotgun metagenomics sequenced at a shallow read depth, beginning with 0.5 million reads, has recently been validated for beginning to investigate species-level taxonomic and functional microbiome data (16). Kraken2 version 2.0.8 was used for taxonomic classification using the available bacterial genome information available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (17). The taxonomic read count table was normalized using reads per million raw reads (RPKM) to control for bias introduced by variable genome size. RPKM was then used to determine the relative abundance of each taxon. Functional analysis of gene and pathway abundance was performed using HUMAnN2 version 2.8.1 with default settings using the UniRef 50 database (18). Identified functional pathway differences and the associated taxonomic drivers were presented using Functional Shifts Taxonomic Contributors (FishTaco) analysis version 1.1.1 (19).

Baseline clinical characteristics of the study population are shown in Table
1. There were no significant differences in demographics among the 3 groups or in previous dietary exposures between the CD and NCGS groups. Study design is shown in Figure

To assess baseline consistency of the gut microbiome composition within each group, samples were collected at a validation timepoint, 14 days before timepoint 1. Between the validation timepoint and timepoint 1, microbiome composition was stable within each study group, with few differences in relative abundance of specific taxa and no differences in alpha or beta diversity (Figure
2).

There were no significant changes in gut microbiome composition during or after gluten challenge in either the CD or NCGS group. Between start and end of gluten challenge (timepoint 1 vs timepoint 3), there were no differences in alpha diversity, beta diversity, or differential abundance of specific taxa within either group (Figure
2; see supplementary Figure 1A, Supplementary Digital Content 1A, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A734, see supplementary Figure 2A , Supplementary Digital Content 2A, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A734).

Baseline gut microbiome composition differed among the 3 study groups, and these differences persisted after gluten challenge (Figure
3A). Although alpha diversity did not differ among the 3 study groups over time (Figure
2A), beta diversity was significantly different among the 3 study groups at all timepoints (Figure
2B; see supplementary Figure 1B, Supplementary Digital Content 1B, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A734, see supplementary Figure 2B, Supplementary Digital Content 2B, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A734). Based on 16S rRNA analyses, multiple specific taxa were differentially abundant in CD and NCGS groups compared with controls at timepoints 1, 2, 3, and 4 (see supplementary Figures 4-6, Supplementary Digital Content 4-6, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A734). Akkermansia muciniphila was enriched in subjects with CD compared with the control group at all timepoints and in NCGS compared with the control group at timepoint 2 only.

Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on CD and NCGS groups at baseline (timepoint 1) and end of gluten challenge (timepoint 3). Using this method, there remained no significant differences in alpha diversity, beta diversity, or differential abundance of any specific taxon between the 2 timepoints within either group. The metagenome-based and taxa-based functional capacity of the microbiome was evaluated using Functional Shifts Taxonomic Contributors (FishTaco) analysis (19); comparing timepoints 1 and 3, there were no significant differences in functional pathways within either group.

The CD and NCGS groups had more severe symptoms than controls at all timepoints (see supplementary Figures 7 and 8, Supplementary Digital Content 7 and 8, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A734), with nonsignificant trend toward worsening of some symptoms over the course of the study. One question in the GSRS specifically evaluated nausea and vomiting; this symptom was most severe in the NCGS group throughout the study, but rose in subjects with CD after gluten exposure. The number of patients with high (more severe) or low (less severe) composite overall symptoms during and after gluten challenge relative to baseline is shown in supplementary Figure 9, Supplementary Digital Content 9, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A734.

When comparing subjects with high vs low diarrhea symptoms after gluten challenge, there were no differences in alpha or beta diversity within either the CD or NCGS group. Differentially abundant specific taxa based on high or low diarrhea symptom in the CD and NCGS groups are shown in supplementary Figure 11, Supplementary Digital Content 11, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A734.

In this prospective study of subjects with CD and NCGS undergoing a 14-day gluten challenge, we found that baseline fecal microbiome composition differed among subjects with CD, subjects with NCGS, and controls, but that within the CD and NCGS groups, gluten challenge led to no significant changes in gut microbiome composition or functional capacity over time. In addition, we found no differences in alpha and beta diversity between subjects with more vs less severe symptoms after gluten challenge and inconsistent differences in differential abundance of specific taxa. These findings provide strong evidence that periodic gluten exposure does not meaningfully disrupt the gut microbiome in people with CD and NCGS observing a gluten-free diet.

In conclusion, in this study of subjects with CD and NCGS previously on a long-term gluten-free diet, we found that a 14-day gluten challenge resulted in no significant changes to fecal microbiome composition in either group. Controls, subjects with CD, and subjects with NCGS had distinct microbiome composition at baseline, and differences persisted regardless of gluten exposure. When patients were stratified based on more severe or less severe symptoms in response to gluten challenge, there were no consistent patterns in gut microbial dysbiosis. Our findings indicate that in people with CD and NCGS on a long-term gluten-free diet, short-term gluten consumption does not alter gut microbiome composition. Gut microbial dysbiosis in patients with established CD or NCGS is unlikely to meaningfully impact disease activity and symptom severity in patients with these conditions.
