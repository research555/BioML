Editorial: Human Microbiome: Symbiosis to Pathogenesis

Researchers have come a long way in microorganism research since the first discovery of microbes as seen through an ingenious hand-held microscope over 300 years ago. In late 1600, the father of microbiology, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, came up with his microscope design and observed tiny moving objects. He named the tiny objects animalcules (Leeuwenhoek, 1963; Smit and Heniger, 1975; Gest, 2004). Since then, the number of studies on microbes began to increase, opening up for a new horizon for research—the roles of microbes living not just in the environment but also throughout the human body.

In this Research Topic, the Human Microbiome: Symbiosis to Pathogenesis, a total of 27 articles have been published, covering several exciting aspects that highlight the role of microbiota in humans, how microbes interact with the host, and how they subsequently contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases as well as metabolic disorders. Based on the gathered information, some research groups have also presented the potential of exploiting these data to design effective preventive and therapeutic options targeting specific bacterial communities.

On top of its current affordable pricing, next-generation sequencing speeds up the bacterial identification processes (by bypassing the need for culturing process) while providing enormous valuable information when combined with big data from other analytical techniques such as flow cytometry and gas or liquid chromatographic methods (Lagier et al., 2012; Escobar-Zepeda et al., 2015; Fouhy et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Jovel et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2019; Osman et al.). A recent study has proposed a new, revised estimated ratio of 1:1 bacterial to human cells after studying the human microbiome thoroughly a few years ago (Sender et al., 2016). Specifically, the colon contains ~10 trillion cells, or 33% of the total bacterial cells in the human body, making it a site with the most microbes compared to other gastrointestinal system sites. Interestingly, Dong et al. shared their findings in this Research Topic, where they observed specific site-preferable bacterial signatures in the oral cavity and other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. These findings are significant in serving as a form of “baseline” to improving the understanding of the microbiome in human health.

Till now, the relationship between humans and microbes appears to be rather complicated; one may even refer to it as a dramatic love-hate relationship as some can cause deadly infections while a portion of them improves the health of the host (Rosenstiel, 2013; Tomkovich and Jobin, 2016; Postler and Ghosh, 2017). As hosts, humans provide a habitat for microbes. In exchange, most microbes return the “favor” in a different form(s), including providing nutrients for the host by breaking down specific substrates (i.e., supporting the host's metabolism) and defending the host against harmful, opportunistic pathogens via habitat colonization and immunomodulatory responses (Iacob et al., Laville et al., Rodionov et al., Sharma et al., Shin et al.). Iacob et al. discussed the importance of the intestinal microbiome in maintaining barrier integrity while promoting and preserving immune homeostasis during intestinal infections. Whether or not the infant's gut is sterile or without microorganisms at birth remains a hot debate among the scientific community. The infant's gut microbiota begins to flourish within hours after birth and starts to stabilize upon reaching 2 years of age (Backhed et al., 2015; Bokulich et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016; Chong et al., 2018; Mohammadkhah et al., 2018). Several factors lead to the microbiome's differences, including delivery mode, breastfeeding history, and drug use (e.g., direct antibiotic use, or mother antenatally). For example, infants delivered via cesarean delivery who lack exposure to the vaginal microbiome have a higher risk of developing asthma, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic diseases. Thus, it is now widely recognized that exposure to the vaginal microbiome of the mother or “vaginal seeding” assist in the formation of a healthy gut microbiome and “priming” the immune system of the infant (Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010; Ferretti et al., 2018; Stinson et al., 2018; Zhu et al.). Zhu et al. challenged the idea of a “sterile” healthy uterine cavity for pregnancy and discussed that bacterial colonization does occur during pregnancy. Even though a metagenomic study based on the 16S rRNA gene revealed certain bacterial groups, these microbes were either non-viable or rarely culturable. On the contrary, the team managed to recover, culture, and identify bacteria from the placenta, which led to the speculation that the bacteria recovered from amniotic fluid might spread through other locations (e.g., blood or placenta). Be that as it may, findings from Liu et al. further supported the notion that the delivery mode affects more than just the infant's microbiome. The team observed a rather peculiar change in the maternal urinary microbiome after cesarean delivery: many beneficial bacteria (including those affiliated with the phylum Firmicutes) dramatically reduced with an increment of potentially pathogenic bacterial populations such as Pseudomonas spp. (under the phylum Proteobacteria and family Pseudomonadaceae). These results suggest these microbial populations' potential, which may serve as risk markers for clinicians to consider protecting these mothers from infectious diseases.

Besides supporting the host's metabolism, microbes produce a wide array of beneficial compounds, including antibiotics and certain SCFAs that can function as “signaling molecules” and modulate the host's immune response (Ganapathy et al., 2013). Zuo and Ng published a review under this Research Topic, emphasizing the role of the gut microbiome in IBD. They indicated that a low intake of dietary fiber and low levels of SCFAs were associated with the development of IBD. Aside from that, the gut microbiome's stability and composition can be influenced by the host's dietary intake and dietary supplements like probiotics and prebiotics, emphasizing the importance of changing the host's eating behavior to restore health by boosting the balance in microbial composition.

Microbes within us could be the answer to identifying and resolving a plethora of health conditions. Instead of using invasive methods such as blood drawing or endoscopy examination, some teams have advocated the idea of screening fecal microbiome to identify specific bacterial signatures that may be used as a biomarker or even prognostic marker. Lu et al. discussed the unique gut microbial characteristics of liver recipients with abnormal and normal liver functions. The study described the fecal microbiome index measuring specific alterations of Staphylococcus and Prevotella spp. that could be used to distinguish liver recipients with abnormal and normal liver function. These findings could then help clinicians make subsequent decisions to ensure the swift recovery of liver function and restore the intestinal microbiota in patients after transplantation.

Other than the gut microbiomes, there is potentially increasing attention placed on studying the microbiomes of organs other than the gastrointestinal system for humanity's benefits, especially for the development of biomarkers. Under this Research Topic, there are a total of six articles exploring the microbiome of other organs such as the nasal, vaginal, urinary, and prostate microbiomes (Balan et al., Zhu et al., Liu et al., Gliniewicz et al., Ma et al., Camelo-Castillo et al.). Ma et al. compared the microbiome profiles of prostatic fluid samples from prostate cancer patients with healthy controls. Typically, detection of prostate cancer is performed using invasive procedures like biopsies and the measurement of prostate-specific antigen, which frequently leads to misdiagnosis due to its high sensitivity and low specificity (Etzioni et al., 2002; Welch and Albertsen, 2009; Kasivisvanathan et al., 2018). This pilot study presented by Ma et al. demonstrated a lower microbial diversity in the prostate fluid of prostate cancer patients compared to healthy controls. Camelo-Castillo et al. compared the nasopharyngeal microbiota of children with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) to matched controls by performing a principal coordinate analysis. While pointing out that specific microbiota profiles should be studied thoroughly as potential biomarkers for IPD or asymptomatic colonization, the study emphasized that identifying beneficial bacteria through this type of study could help fight against pneumococcal infections, possibly by integrating these microorganisms in a probiotic formula. Having that said, these studies serve as an essential steppingstone in identifying specific bacterial species as novel diagnostic biomarkers. They offer an exciting perspective to consider capitalizing on their roles in different diseases to formulate better therapeutic and prevention strategies in the nearest future.

With the increasing ability to understand microbial metabolic and functional capabilities, the microbiome's contribution to human health and various diseases is becoming more evident. Researchers are attempting to untangle the complicated relationships between microbes and humans as the host. More work is needed to move toward personalized medicine by restoring balance in the gut microbiome, regardless of population replacement via FMT or introduction of prebiotics or probiotics. Just as insinuated by Bodkhe et al., it might be worthwhile to investigate the microbiome of close relatives of patients suffering heritable diseases such as celiac disease. The investigation may give a better overview of alterations in the microbiome during disease progression or transition. Given the complexity of interactions between host-microbe and microbe-microbe, defining the “baseline” for a healthy gut microbiome seems like the next hurdle for everyone in microbiome research. Nonetheless, the Research Topic's findings strengthen the current opinion on dysbiosis and human health and suggest the importance of seeking an association between different microbiomes in the human body. Understanding the symbiotic relationships between the human host and microbiome will guarantee success in the restoration of the microbiome for disease prevention, management, and treatment.
