The colorectal cancer-associated faecal microbiome of developing countries resembles that of developed countries

The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing in developing countries, yet limited research on the CRC- associated microbiota has been conducted in these areas, in part due to scarce resources, facilities, and the difficulty of fresh or frozen stool storage/transport. Here, we aimed (1) to establish a broad representation of diverse developing countries (Argentina, Chile, India, and Vietnam); (2) to validate a ‘resource-light’ sample-collection protocol translatable in these settings using guaiac faecal occult blood test (gFOBT) cards stored and, importantly, shipped internationally at room temperature; (3) to perform initial profiling of the collective CRC-associated microbiome of these developing countries; and (4) to compare this quantitatively with established CRC biomarkers from developed countries.

We assessed the effect of international storage and transport at room temperature by replicating gFOBT from five UK volunteers, storing two in the UK, and sending replicates to institutes in the four countries. Next, to determine the effect of prolonged UK storage, DNA extraction replicates for a subset of samples were performed up to 252 days apart. To profile the CRC-associated microbiome of developing countries, gFOBT were collected from 41 treatment-naïve CRC patients and 40 non-CRC controls from across the four institutes, and V4 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed. Finally, we constructed a random forest (RF) model that was trained and tested against existing datasets from developed countries.

The microbiome was stably assayed when samples were stored/transported at room temperature and after prolonged UK storage. Large-scale microbiome structure was separated by country and continent, with a smaller effect from CRC. Importantly, the RF model performed similarly to models trained using external datasets and identified similar taxa of importance (Parvimonas, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, Alistipes, and Escherichia).

This study demonstrates that gFOBT, stored and transported at room temperature, represents a suitable method of faecal sample collection for amplicon-based microbiome biomarkers in developing countries and suggests a CRC-faecal microbiome association that is consistent between developed and developing countries.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth commonest cause of global cancer-related deaths. Incidence rates have traditionally been highest in developed countries, but are increasing in developing countries, many of which are ill-equipped to respond to this new burden of disease [1]. There is growing evidence of an association between CRC and an altered faecal microbiome, with the potential to develop novel screening, prognostic or therapeutic markers. Certain bacteria have been proposed as putative oncomicrobes and specific genetic elements such as toxins have been implicated [2]. However, the majority of CRC-microbiome research has profiled developed cohorts. Of the limited number of studies conducted in developing countries, most have been small pilot studies [3–7]. It cannot be assumed that results from developed countries will be generalisable to developing populations, as the health-associated microbiome of developed and developing populations has been shown to differ taxonomically and functionally [8].

To improve the field’s ability to conduct low-cost gut microbiome profiling for CRC screening in developing countries, and to provide a pilot assessment of the global CRC-linked microbiome, we established a network comprising researchers from the continents of South America (Argentina and Chile, Development Assistance Committee (DAC)-listed upper-middle income countries at the time of the study), South East Asia (India and Vietnam, DAC-listed lower-middle income countries), and Europe (UK) as a control. These countries represent a range of increasing CRC incidence rates (Age Standardised World Rate in 2018 per 100,000 person-years: India 4.4; Vietnam 13.4; Chile 20.7; Argentina 25.0; UK 32.1) [18–22]. With the exception of the UK, limited microbiome research, in particular CRC-microbiome profiling, has been conducted in these countries [6, 23, 24] We sought to address these current limitations by assessing whether gFOBT cards collected both in the country of interest and from UK volunteers, then stored/transported at ambient temperatures, could assess CRC-associated microbes comparably around the globe. After establishing the efficacy of our methodology, we compared the faecal microbiomes of ten CRC patients and ten non-CRC controls each from India, Vietnam, Chile, and Argentina, using a standardised methodology to mitigate technical biases, and found the resulting CRC-associated amplicon profiles to be comparable with those from existing CRC-associated metagenomes from developed countries.

Replicate gFOBT samples were created to investigate the effect of international transport and storage (Fig. 1a). A convenience group of five healthy UK volunteers (relatives of a member of the UK research team) was used; each volunteer donated a stool. Volunteers were aged between 28 and 66, had no history of colonoscopy or antibiotic use within the preceding 6 months, and had no comorbidities. Each stool was used to make ten gFOBT (Hema Screen, Immunostics, Inc). gFOBT were stored at room temperature for 24 h. Developer solution (Hema Screen, Immunostics, Inc) was then applied and gFOBT were left to dry. gFOBT were stored in individual sealed bags at room temperature prior to transit (115–171 days).

To assess the effect of the storage conditions which the CRC/non-CRC control samples had been subject to, a second set of gFOBT was stored in India, Vietnam, Chile, and Argentina at room temperature for the duration of CRC/non-CRC control sample collection (Vietnam 29 days, Argentina 76 days, India 115 days, and Chile 196 days). The recorded laboratory temperatures were as follows: UK (mean monthly temperature 20–23 °C, maximum 27 °C), Vietnam (mean not available, maximum 25 °C), Argentina (mean 15 °C, maximum 20 °C), Chile (mean 20 °C, maximum 22 °C), and India (mean 24 °C, maximum 27 °C). Samples were returned at ambient temperature with the CRC/non-CRC control samples (transit time 5–10 days), and DNA extraction was performed upon receipt.

gFOBT and clinical data were collected from ten CRC patients and ten non-CRC controls each from Vietnam (Can Tho University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Can Tho, April–June 2018), Argentina (Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, June–August 2018), India (Cancer Institute (WIA) Chennai, July–October 2018), and Chile (Universidad de los Andes Santiago, October 2018–February 2019, samples collected in fact from 11 CRC patients and ten non-CRC controls), to give a total cohort of 81 individuals (Fig.
1a). Non-CRC controls comprised either people with a normal bowel at colonoscopy (Vietnam and Argentina) or asymptomatic individuals working in the affiliated University (Chile and India). Both control groups (colonoscopy-normal controls or asymptomatic controls) are variously used in microbiome studies; we offered flexibility as the institutes in Chile and India had limited access to colonoscopy-normal controls (colonoscopy is less readily available in some developing countries). Colonoscopies were carried out a minimum of 2 weeks prior to sample collection (during which time the majority of taxa return to baseline). CRC patients were treatment-naïve. Study participants were aged over 18. Exclusion criteria included the following: antibiotic use within the preceding 6 months; foreign travel within the preceding 2 weeks; colonoscopy within the preceding 2 weeks; related to another study participant; colostomy; history of previous CRC/adenoma, colorectal surgery, pelvic radiation, or chemotherapy; known CRC syndrome or family history of hereditary CRC; and coexistent IBD or infectious bowel disease.

To limit batch effects, samples from CRC patients and non-CRC controls were collected as far as possible alternately and were transported and processed as a single batch. Participants provided a stool which was used to prepare a gFOBT. Developer solution was applied the same day in the majority of instances (occasionally the following day), and gFOBT were left to dry. gFOBT were stored in individual sealed bags at room temperature. Once collection was complete, samples were returned to the UK at ambient temperature.

To assess the effect of prolonged UK storage at room temperature, DNA extraction replicates were created from a subset of the CRC/non-CRC control samples (n = 21 pairs), by extracting DNA from three squares of faecally loaded card at baseline (details below) and subsequently from the three remaining squares after prolonged UK storage (Fig.
1a). Time between DNA extraction of replicate pairs was as follows: Chilean samples 27 days, Indian samples 140 days, Argentinian samples 211 days, and Vietnamese samples 252 days.

Sample processing was performed at the University of Leeds. The QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) was used until its discontinuation in August 2018, whereupon the equivalent QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and Buffer ASL (Qiagen, Germany) were used.

From each gFOBT, three squares of faecally loaded card were dissected and processed as a single combined sample. The rationale of this approach is that it subsamples a larger volume of stool, ensuring adequate biomass even from thinly smeared gFOBT (the volume of stool per gFOBT can be very variable when prepared by study participants), and leaves three squares remaining for alternative analysis or DNA extraction replicates. Next, 800 μl of Buffer ASL was added and samples were incubated at 23 °C on a Thermomixer Comfort (Eppendorf UK) at 850 rpm for 1 h. Samples were briefly centrifuged and supernatant transferred to pathogen lysis tubes (S) (Qiagen, Germany). Samples were agitated (Vibrax VXR, IKA, UK) at a motor setting of 1800–2200 for 10 min followed by incubation at 95 °C on the Thermomixer at 850 rpm for 15 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 18625g for 1 min, and supernatant was transferred to a tube containing 173 μl of 10 M ammonium acetate. We then vortexed the samples and placed them on ice for 5 min, then centrifuged at 18625g for 5 min. Supernatant was transferred to a tube containing 725 μl of propan-2-ol, vortexed, and placed on ice for 30 min. Then, samples were centrifuged at 18625g for 10 min, supernatant was discarded, and 1 ml of 70% ethanol was added. Samples were centrifuged at 18625g for 5 min, supernatant discarded, and 500 μl 70% ethanol was added. Samples were centrifuged at 18625g for 3 min, supernatant discarded, and the samples left for 10 min to evaporate residual ethanol. Two hundred microliters of tris-EDTA was added, and after 10 min, samples were vortexed and added to tubes containing 200 μl of Buffer AL (QIAamp DNA Mini Kit). Fifteen microliters of Proteinase K (QIAamp DNA Mini Kit) was added; the samples were vortexed and incubated at 70 °C on the Thermomixer at 650 rpm for 10 min. The QIAamp DNA Mini Kit protocol was then followed. To elute DNA, 100 μl of UV-irradiated molecular biology grade water was added to samples for 5 min before centrifuging at 18625g for 1 min.

The Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) 16S Illumina Amplicon library preparation methodology was followed [25], with Illumina 16S V4 primer constructs 515F (Parada)-806R (Apprill) [26, 27]. Single (rather than triplicate) PCR reactions were performed per sample, each with a starting amount of 20 ng DNA. One hundred fifty-two samples were sequenced as part of a total pool of 996 samples from other projects, on one lane of an Illumina HiSeq 3000, for 2x150bp sequencing, with a 10 bp index read.

Reads were stripped of adaptors using cutadapt [28]. Further processing was carried out in QIIME2 (version 2019.4) [29]. Reads were trimmed to a maximum of 145 bp, pairs merged, denoised, and representative sequences chosen using DADA2 [30].

In total, we profiled 16S rRNA gene amplicons from stool representing the gut microbiomes of 41 CRC participants and 40 non-CRC controls, spanning Argentina, Chile, India, and Vietnam (Fig.
1, Table 1). The majority of tumours were located in the caecum/ascending colon or sigmoid/rectum and were stage pT3 or pT4 (Table 2).

Age is, of course, a substantial contributor to CRC development, although it is not generally a major driver of microbiome variation within the range studied here (e.g. associated with ~ 5% of taxonomic variation, see below). The median age of non-CRC controls from Argentina, Chile, and India was substantially younger than the corresponding CRC patients, and the median age of CRC patients from India and Vietnam was younger than that of CRC patients from Chile and Argentina (Table
1). While this did not substantially affect subsequent analyses when tested, we note it both here and in our initial profiles of microbiome composition below. Non-CRC controls from Chile and India were asymptomatic individuals working in the affiliated Universities. Non-CRC controls from Vietnam and Argentina underwent colonoscopy, yielding descriptions of ‘macroscopically normal bowel’ (n = 14), diverticulosis (n = 4), or ‘macroscopically normal bowel with haemorrhoids’ (n = 2), which are grouped together in subsequent analyses as non-CRC control (it should be noted that these are common colonoscopy findings in older populations and have not been associated with a distinct microbiome profile) [49] . The total reads/sample (CRC patients, non-CRC controls and UK volunteers) were 51,000–167,000 (median 117,000).

To first investigate the effect of international transport and storage, 50 replicate gFOBT were created using stool from a subset of the total population, comprising five UK volunteers (ten replicate gFOBT/volunteer). Two gFOBT from each volunteer remained in the UK. Two gFOBT from each volunteer were transported to institutes in Argentina, Chile, India, and Vietnam; of these, one from each volunteer was stored for a short duration, and one was stored for the duration of CRC/non-CRC control sample collection (Fig.
1a).

To determine whether the microbiome would remain stable if samples were stored for a prolonged period at room temperature in the UK pending DNA extraction, extraction replicates were created from a subset of the CRC/non-CRC control samples (Fig.
1a). DNA extraction was performed upon sample receipt, by dissecting three squares of faecally loaded card, and extraction replicates were created by dissecting the alternate three squares after a period of storage at room temperature. Pairs of replicate samples had similar microbiome structures and taxonomic profiles (average inter-individual replicate Bray-Curtis dissimilarity = 0.17) (Additional file 1: Fig. S2A-C). No significant taxonomic differences were detected by LEfSe between the groups of baseline and replicate samples.

Aside from inter-individual differences, the greatest determinant of microbiome structure was country of origin (Fig.
2a). PERMANOVA quantified this based on Bray-Curtis distances (R2 = 14%) (p = 0.001), with ‘disease status’ (CRC or non-CRC control) contributing far less (R2 = 2%) (p = 0.019) (Fig.
2b, c, Additional file 1: Table S1). A significant difference in alpha diversity (Shannon) was likewise detected between countries (Kruskal Wallis p = 4 × 10−5). Specifically, the alpha diversities of Vietnamese and Indian samples were significantly lower than those of the Argentinian and Chilean samples, and those of the Indian samples were lower than the Vietnamese (Fig.
2d). No significant difference in Shannon diversity index was detected between overall CRC and non-CRC control samples (Kruskal Wallis p = 0.28).

In addition to country of origin, continent was itself a driver of microbiome structure, with the majority of the Asian samples (India and Vietnam) distinct from the majority of the South American samples (Chile and Argentina) (Fig.
2e). In our study, similar to previous reports, Asian samples had a significantly higher relative abundance of Prevotella (LDA score 5.173, p = 2.79 × 10−6) and lower relative abundance of Bacteroides (LDA score 4.841, p = 2.32 × 10−6) compared with South American samples (Additional file 1: Fig. S3A-C).

To determine the potential of the microbiome to discriminate between CRC and non-CRC control samples, a RF model was built using the combined total dataset of CRC and non-CRC controls (AUC 0.77 (CI 0.67–0.87)). Given the age-imbalance within our dataset, we compared the result with an age-adjusted RF model; the age-adjusted RF model performed equivalently (AUC 0.80 (CI 0.69–0.89)), confirming that age does not account for the discriminatory performance of the RF model.

These results together indicate that the CRC-associated microbiome is substantially consistent, and can be consistently measured, across multiple very different international populations. This was true across cohorts and sample handling within this study and surprisingly also proved to hold when comparing these diverse populations to external CRC cohorts. In general, control-associated taxa were of lesser importance to the RF models than CRC-associated taxa. This is likely due to the heterogeneous nature of the current study’s control group and of different “healthy” populations’ gut microbiomes generally. It suggests that the commonality of some CRC-associated microbiome shifts may be particularly important, either causally or in response to cancer-induced changes in the intestinal microenvironment.

To date, limited microbiome research has been conducted in developing countries, leaving a gap in our knowledge of gut microbial relationships with chronic disease in global populations. We sought to address this in CRC by establishing a network of researchers and participants from Argentina, Chile, India, and Vietnam. First, we demonstrated that gFOBT, stored at room temperature and, importantly, also transported at ambient temperature, were suitable for genus-level faecal microbial taxonomic profiling in a translational setting across these multinational cohorts. This also remained true for gFOBT samples with prolonged storage periods at room temperature in the UK. This allowed us to further profile the faecal microbiomes of CRC patients and non-CRC controls from Argentina, Chile, India, and Vietnam, and, through comparison with external datasets, to demonstrate that the CRC-associated microbiome of these developing countries resembles that of developed countries.

Continuing to explore the global effects of the microbiome on CRC has the potential to improve both the disease’s management worldwide and our understanding of the underlying basic biology. It will be important to expand the cohort by sampling a larger number of participants with more rigorous age and gender matching, in addition to expanding the number of countries profiled, as well as the geographical catchment within countries, many of which show great intra-country diversity. Importantly, microbiome profiling may provide valuable insight into the rising incidence of CRC within these countries, and the shared CRC-associated microbiome raises the potential of a generalisable microbiome-based CRC screening test. To this end, we have demonstrated that gFOBT is a suitable method of faecal sample collection for 16S rRNA gene research in developing countries (Argentina, Chile, India, and Vietnam) and that their CRC-associated microbiome shares many features with that of developed countries. We encourage other researchers to investigate the CRC microbiome in greater depth and in additional populations, with the goal of preventing or treating the disease around the globe.

Limited CRC-microbiome research has been conducted in developing countries, yet CRC incidence is increasing in these areas. One of the impediments to creating and applying CRC-microbiome biomarkers is the collection of frozen stool samples. Here, we investigated the efficacy of stool-based biomarkers using bowel cancer screening cards (gFOBT), stored and, importantly, transported at room temperature. We then used this technique to investigate the microbiome of CRC patients and controls from four developing countries (Argentina, Chile, India, and Vietnam). Remarkably, we show that the CRC-associated microbiome of these developing countries resembles that of developed countries, even when using limited, field-appropriate, and scalable sampling methods.
