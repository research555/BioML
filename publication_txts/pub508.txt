Gut Microbiome Changes Associated With HIV Infection and Sexual Orientation



Background: Many studies have explored changes in the gut microbiome associated with HIV infection, but the consistent pattern of changes has not been clarified. Men who have sex with men (MSM) are very likely to be an independent influencing factor of the gut microbiome, but relevant research is still lacking.

Conclusions: This study shows that the changes in the gut microbiome are related to HIV and MSM status. Importantly, MSM status may have a far greater impact on the gut microbiome than HIV status.

Early studies have shown that the intestinal mucosa is the primary site of early HIV-1 reproduction, irrespective of the way in which HIV-1 invades the body, whether by sexual contact or blood transfusion (Mehandru et al., 2004). HIV-1, which enters the intestinal mucosa at the very early stages of infection, can cause the Th17 CD4+T cells of the intestine to be destroyed and depleted and the integrity of the intestinal mucosa to be impaired (Epple et al., 2010; Hirao et al., 2014). In addition, gut microbiome translocation can occur, and the gut microbiome and its products can enter the systemic blood circulation (Balagopal et al., 2008), eventually leading to activation of the immune system and spread of the HIV-1 infection (Brenchley et al., 2006).

To clarify the diversity of the gut microbiome related to HIV infection, to determine whether MSM status is an independent factor influencing the gut microbiome, and to explore the consistent change in the gut microbiome and functional pathways in HIV+ individuals and MSM, we screened 12 published studies of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the gut microbiome related to HIV/AIDS (six of these studies contain data that is relevant and available to MSM) from NCBI and EBI databases. The alpha diversity indexes, beta diversity indexes, genera, species, and KEGG functional pathways related to the gut microbiome were calculated. Finally, the overall trend in the above indicators was evaluated.

Studies of human fecal flora related to HIV/AIDS by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing before October 2019 were retrieved from the NCBI and EBI databases. Studies were screened according to the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: (1) cross-sectional studies, (2) each sample should give the HIV status of the corresponding subject, (3) the sample types of the sequences should be stool or rectal swabs, and (4) the sequencing method should be 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Studies with sample sizes of HIV+ or HIV– individuals of <5 were excluded. The technical route of the study is shown in Figure 1.

The raw sequences were processed using QIIME version 1.9 (Caporaso et al., 2010), and the general process included FLASH software (Magoc and Salzberg, 2011) used for splicing paired-end 16S rRNA gene reads. After splicing, Cutadapt was used for removing primers from the sequences, and low-quality sequences were removed. Based on the chimera database of UCHIME (Edgar et al., 2011), Usearch version 6.1.554 was used to identify and remove chimeras in the sequences, and open reference operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking was performed with UCLUST (Edgar, 2010) against the Greengenes database (DeSantis et al., 2006), version 13.8, with a similarity of at least 97% (Rideout et al., 2014). The analysis after clustering used the platforms of MicrobiomeAnalyst (Dhariwal et al., 2017), R 3.5.1, Galaxy (Goecks et al., 2013), and REVMAN 5.3.

Data filtering is done to remove low quality or uninformative features to improve downstream statistical analysis. The minimum count and prevalence in the samples (%) were filtered according to the characteristics of each dataset, which may be caused by sequencing errors or low levels of contamination in the sample. At the same time, for the features that were close to constant throughout the experiment, which are conditions that are not likely to be associated with the conditions under study, we used the interquartile range (IQR) to detect their variances and filters.

To address the variability in the sampling depth and the sparsity of the data in order to enable more biologically meaningful comparisons, we used total sum scaling (TSS) to bring all samples to the same scale by dividing the samples by a scaling factor.

At the OTU level, to assess alpha diversity, richness (Observed, Chao1, and ACE) and diversity (Shannon, Simpson, Fisher, and Invsimpson) indexes were calculated. Differences between two groups were analyzed via the Student's t-test and the Mann–Whitney U-test. For principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), distance matrices were calculated using the Bray–Curtis, Jensen–Shannon divergence, and Jaccard ecological dissimilarity indexes. The permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) test was performed on this distance matrix.

REVMAN 5.3 software was used to build the forest plots based on the alpha diversity indexes, and Chi2 and I2 were used for heterogeneity testing for each study. If p > 0.1 or I2 < 50%, the constructed model is not heterogeneous. Sensitivity analysis removes the study with the largest sample size and non-European/non-U.S. studies and converts the fixed effects model (FEM) to the random effects model (REM). All p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons through the false discovery rate (FDR) technique. All tests were two-sided, and an FDR p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A total of 36 studies related to HIV infection were retrieved from the NCBI and EBI databases. Twelve studies were finally selected for subsequent analysis. The total number of samples included in the overall analysis was 1,288 (HIV+ individuals, n = 744; HIV– individuals, n = 544). Six of the 12 studies contain data that is relevant and available to MSM status, including 632 samples (MSM, n = 328; non-MSM, n = 304). The metadata variables were HIV status, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), MSM status, ART use, CD4+T cell count, and HIV viral load (VL). A summary of the included studies is presented in Table 1. The unfiltered sequencing quality results are presented in Supplementary Table 1.

The calculation results of the alpha diversity indexes of the OTU level of 12 studies are shown in Table 2. Before controlling for other confounding factors, the alpha diversity of the HIV+ individuals was significantly lower than that of the HIV– individuals, including the ACE (Z = 2.92, FDR p = 0.009), Shannon (Z = 3.44, FDR p = 0.004), Simpson (Z = 2.37, FDR p = 0.028), and Insimpson indexes (Z = 2.85, FDR p = 0.009) of the FEM. The results after the sensitivity analysis remained consistent. The forest maps (Figure 2a, Supplementary Figure 1) and boxplots (Figure 3) of the 12 studies included also showed this trend.

The subgroup analysis controlled for gender, including 472 men and 175 women. In men, there was no significant difference in alpha diversity between HIV+ and HIV– individuals (Supplementary Figure 2). Among women, HIV+ status was associated with a significant decrease in alpha diversity, including Observed (Z = 2.78, FDR p = 0.035) and ACE (Z = 2.52, FDR p = 0.035) (Figure 2b, Supplementary Figure 3). In MSM (n = 316), there was no significant difference in alpha diversity between HIV+ and HIV– individuals (Supplementary Figure 4). In non-MSM (n = 288), HIV+ status was associated with a significant decrease in alpha diversity, including Observed (Z = 3.32, FDR p = 0.006), Chao1 (Z = 2.69, FDR p = 0.010), ACE (Z = 2.89, FDR p = 0.010), Shannon (Z = 2.89, FDR p = 0.010), and Simpson (Z = 2.81, FDR p = 0.009) (Figure 2c, Supplementary Figure 5). When age (age <45 years, n = 409; age ≥45 years, n = 288) and BMI (BMI = 18.5–23.9, n = 206; BMI = 24–27.9, n = 201; BMI > 28, n = 133) (Supplementary Figures 6–10) were controlled, there was no significant difference in alpha diversity between HIV+ and HIV– individuals. The results after the sensitivity analysis remained consistent.

The subgroup analysis controlled for the CD4+T cell count, including 146 HIV+ individuals with a CD4+T cell count of <500, 272 HIV+ individuals with a CD4+T cell count of ≥500, and 217 HIV– individuals. HIV+ individuals with a CD4+T cell count of <500 have significantly lower alpha diversity than HIV– individuals (Shannon [Z = 2.78, FDR p = 0.035]). However, there is no significant difference in the alpha diversity of HIV+ individuals with a CD4+T cell count of ≥500 compared to HIV– individuals (Figure 2d, Supplementary Figures 11, 12). When controlled for the ART, including 188 HIV+ non-ART users, 240 HIV+ ART users, and 294 HIV– individuals. The results showed that the alpha diversity of HIV+ non-ART users was significantly lower than that of HIV– individuals (Shannon [Z = 2.91, FDR p = 0.021]), and the difference was not found in HIV+ ART users and HIV– individuals (Figure 2e, Supplementary Figures 13, 14). In the stratified analyses examining the HIV VL (VL ≤ 200, n = 244; VL > 200, n = 174; and HIV– individuals, n = 217) was not significantly associated with alpha diversity (Supplementary Figures 15, 16). The results after the sensitivity analysis remained consistent.

The calculation results of the alpha diversity indexes of the OTU level of six studies are shown in Table 3. Before controlling for other confounding factors, the alpha diversity of the MSM individuals was significantly lower than that of the non-MSM individuals, including the Simpson (Z = 3.32, FDR p = 0.001) and Invsimpson (Z = 3.49, FDR p = 0.001) of the FEM. The forest maps (Figure 4a, Supplementary Figure 17) and boxplots (Figure 5) of the six studies included also show this trend. The analysis was restricted to HIV status (HIV+ individuals, n = 406; HIV– individuals, n = 210), age (age <45 years, n = 334; age ≥45 years, n = 230), and BMI (BMI = 18.5–23.9, n = 164; BMI = 24–27.9, n = 161; BMI > 28, n = 96). In the HIV+ (Fisher [Z = 6.01, FDR p < 0.000]), age ≥45 years (Fisher [Z = 6, FDR p < 0.000]), and BMI = 24–27.9 (Fisher [Z = 3.84, FDR p = 0.001]) (Figures 4b,e,f, Supplementary Figures 18, 21–24) individuals, MSM status was associated with increasing alpha diversity. Among HIV– (Invsimpson [Z = 4.61, FDR p < 0.000]) and age <45 years individuals (Invsimpson [Z = 3.05, FDR p = 0.005]), MSM status was associated with a significant decrease in alpha diversity (Figures 4c,d, Supplementary Figures 19, 20). The results after the sensitivity analysis remained consistent.

We explored the potential influence of HIV and MSM status on the composition of the gut microbiome, according to the PERMANOVA test of ecological distances. PCoA ordination plots of Bray–Curtis showed that samples from works by Lozupone et al. (2013) (R2 = 0.154, FDR p < 0.001), Dubourg et al. (2016) (R2 = 0.080, FDR p < 0.001), and Armstrong et al. (2018) (R2 = 0.059, FDR p < 0.001) were significantly clustered according to HIV status (Figure 6, Table 4). The samples from works by Noguera-Julian et al. (2016) (R2 = 0.122, FDR p < 0.001), Vesterbacka et al. (2017) (R2 = 0.081, FDR p < 0.001), Armstrong et al. (2018) (R2 = 0.090, FDR p < 0.001), and Li et al. (2019) (R2 = 0.115, FDR p < 0.001) showed better clustering according to MSM status rather than HIV status (Figure 7, Table 5).

We identified the genus and species that cause changes in the composition of the gut microbiome of HIV+ individuals and MSM. In at least three studies, the genus of Bacteroides, Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium, and SMB53 and the species of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bacteroides caccae, Coprococcus catus, Parabacteroides distasonis, Akkermansia muciniphila, Blautia obeum, Bacteroides ovatus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Bacteroides uniformis were significantly reduced in HIV+ individuals. The species of Prevotella stercorea was significantly increased in HIV+ individuals (Figure 8). In MSM, the genus of Catenibacterium, Eubacterium, Mitsuokella, Phascolarctobacterium, Prevotella, and Slackia and the species of Eubacterium biforme, Prevotella copri, and Prevotella stercorea were significantly increased, and the genus of Adlercreutzia, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Bilophila, Holdemania, Odoribacter, Parabacteroides and the species of Bacteroides caccae, Parabacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides ovatus, Ruminococcus torques, and Bacteroides uniformis were significantly reduced (Figure 9).

We analyzed the differential functional pathways of KEGG related to HIV and MSM status. For HIV status, there were 91 differential KEGG III functional pathways that co-exist in multiple studies (≥3 studies). For MSM status, there were 97 differential KEGG functional pathways that co-exist in multiple studies (≥3 studies). Among HIV+ individuals and MSM, most of the KEGG III pathways under metabolism were downregulated, and most of the KEGG III pathways under genetic information processing were downregulated (Figures 10,
11). For example, in HIV+ individuals and MSM, carbohydrate-metabolism-related pathways of galactose metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, and the pentose phosphate pathway, were downregulated; amino-acid-metabolism-related pathways of histidine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis, were downregulated; and lipid-metabolism-related pathways of linoleic acid metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and secondary bile acid biosynthesis, were downregulated. The prediction accuracy of different PICRUSt studies related to HIV and MSM status are shown in Supplementary Table 2 and Table 3.

In this study, we collected 12 studies to evaluate the relationship between the gut microbiome and the HIV and MSM status. In the overall assessment of 12 datasets and by restricting the analysis to woman and non-MSM individuals, HIV+ status was associated with decreased alpha diversity, consistent with the results of a recent meta-analysis (Tuddenham et al., 2020). Importantly, when controlling for a CD4+T cell count of <500 and non-ART, HIV+ status was also significantly associated with decreased alpha diversity. The assessment of the overall effect of six datasets related to MSM status showed that MSM status was associated with decreased alpha diversity, but the results of the subgroup analysis (restricting the analysis to HIV status, age <45 years, age ≥45 years, BMI = 24–27.9) were inconsistent. The analysis of the microbiome composition showed that in multiple studies the sample clustered in different areas of the PCoA coordinate axis according to HIV and MSM status. This clustering phenomenon is more significant between MSM and non-MSM. We also found that HIV+ and MSM status were related to consistent changes in the specific genera, species, and KEGG functional pathways.

In conclusion, our results clarified that HIV+ status is associated with decreased alpha diversity of the gut microbiome. MSM status was an important factor affecting the study of HIV-related gut microbiomes; that is, MSM was associated with alpha diversity changes in the gut microbiome regardless of HIV infection, and the change in gut microbiome composition of MSM was more significant than that of HIV+ individuals. There was a consistent change in B. caccae, B. ovatus, B. uniformis, and P. stercorea, in HIV+ individuals and MSM. The differential expression of the gut microbiome was also accompanied by changes in functional pathways, such as carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism, These findings might help to elucidate the effects of HIV+ and MSM status on the gut microbiome in humans.
