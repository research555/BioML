(Dis)Trust your gut: the gut microbiome in age-related inflammation, health, and disease



Chronic inflammation represents one of the most consistent biologic features of aging. However, the precise etiology of persistent low-grade increases in inflammation remains unclear. Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiome may play a key role in age-related inflammation. Indeed, several studies have indicated that older adults display an altered composition of the gut microbiota, and early evidence indicates that this dysbiosis is associated with the presence of several key circulating inflammatory analytes. The present review summarizes knowledge on age-related inflammation and discusses how potential relationships with gut dysbiosis may lead to novel treatment strategies in the future.

“The pattern of disease is an expression of the response of man to his total environment (physical, biological, and social); this response is, therefore, determined by anything that affects man himself or his environment.” – Rene Dubos, 1961

In humans, aging is a continual and progressive process that results in decreased physiologic function across all organ systems [1]. These physiologic decrements result in an increased vulnerability to infection and disease that dramatically elevates mortality risk [2, 3]. Compared to persons 25–44 years of age, mortality risk among older adults is elevated by 100-fold for stroke and chronic lung disease, roughly 90-fold for heart disease, pneumonia, and influenza, and over 40-fold for cancer [2]. Given the rapid increase in life expectancy and increasing proportion of older adults within the population [4], an increased understanding of the biologic mechanisms which underlie age-related increases in disease prevalence are warranted.

Though the etiologies of age-related diseases are quite diverse, significant evidence implicates chronic, low-grade inflammation as one of the most consistent biologic features of both chronological aging and various age-related diseases/disorders [5–8]. In fact, a recent PubMed search for the terms “aging and inflammation” revealed nearly 10000 publications in this area (Fig. 1) with this pair of risk factors implicated in the pathobiology of a wide variety of diseases and disorders across nearly every organ system (Fig. 2a).

Very recently, however, emerging evidence has suggested that the gut microbiome may play an integral role in these age-related inflammatory changes. Recent evidence indicates that advanced age is associated with changes in microbiota composition characterized by a loss of diversity in the core taxa [40]. Moreover, these age-related changes in the microbiome have also been recently associated with key geriatric syndromes including physical frailty [41] and dementia [42]. Therefore, the objective of this review is to discuss the available evidence related to gut microbiome and aging, with particular emphasis on age-related inflammation and associated diseases/conditions.

The human intestinal tract (i.e., “gut”) is inhabited by over 100 trillion microorganisms; including over 1000 species of known bacteria.[43] These organisms have co-evolved with humans over millennia to live together for mutual benefit [44, 45]. Though commonly overlooked in considerations of human health and disease treatment (hence the nickname the “forgotten organ” [46]), gut microorganisms encode >150 times more genes than the human genome and are highly involved in numerous metabolic reactions which influence normal host physiology and metabolism [47, 48]. In fact, an enormous portion of the body’s constitutive immune function is dedicated to maintaining homeostasis with the microbiota, as evidenced by the fact that 70% of the body’s lymphocytes reside in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue [49].

In line with known interactions of the microbiome with the systemic circulation and distal tissues, gut dysbiosis—commonly defined as a disturbance of or change in the density and/or composition of gut microbiota—has been linked to a wide variety of diseases and health conditions (Fig. 2b). These conditions include cystic fibrosis [57], inflammatory bowel conditions (irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, and colon cancer [58–60], neurological diseases (Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and multiple sclerosis)) [61–63], metabolic diseases (obesity and diabetes) [64, 65], as well as musculoskeletal conditions (frailty, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout) [41, 66–68]. Notably, as evidenced by the remarkable similarity between Fig. 2a, b, the majority of these conditions exhibit age-related increases in incidence. Accordingly, it seems relevant to explore the possibility that age-related inflammation may stem at least partially from changes to the gut microbiome.

As noted above, the human ageing process is associated with gradual declines in function across virtually every bodily organ. In contrast, however, the bacterial organisms in the gut do not age per se and thus might be unexpected to follow the typical trajectory of physiological decline seen elsewhere in the body [69]. And yet, as pointed out by O’Toole and Jeffery [69], older individuals often experience gut-associated comorbidities, changes in diet and physical activity patterns, and other gut-related physiologic changes which may influence gut bacteria. Thus, questions persist regarding how such changes may interact with gut bacteria to influence microbiome composition and function.

Similarly, early findings now suggest that gut dysbiosis may contribute to age-related declines in cognitive function. Cattaneo et al. recently reported that brain amyloidosis and peripheral inflammation among cognitively impaired elders was associated with the abundance of pro- and anti-inflammatory gut microbiota [42]. Indeed, brain amyloid content and circulating inflammatory analytes were positively associated with the inflammatory bacteria taxon Escherichia/Shigella and negatively associated with the anti-inflammatory E. rectale taxon. To my knowledge, these are the first data directly linking the gut microbiota to age-related cognitive decline, though numerous studies in other models (e.g., Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, animal models of Alzheimer’s disease) exist to indicate a well-defined gut-brain axis which could contribute to age-related dementias [62, 75, 76]. Given the dramatic public health implications of understanding and intervening upon age-related dementias, continued research in this area seems highly warranted.

The precise etiologic explanation for these age-related changes remains incomplete. Across the age-spectrum, dramatic increases in the use of antibiotics and increasing pervasiveness of a high-saturated fat and high-sugar “western” diet are proposed to directly contribute to the depletion of important beneficial components of the microbiome [50, 77]. In turn, these changes contribute to chronic activation of the immune system and a dramatic rise in the prevalence of chronic inflammatory disorders. These two factors also represent key modifiable health factors which may contribute to exacerbated dysbiosis among older adults.

Though somewhat speculative at present, it is possible that the leaky gut is a primary source of inflammation long-observed within the circulation. Studies in Drosophila have reported that age-related changes in the microbiome increase intestinal permeability [89] and drive chronic inflammation [90]. More recently, Thevaranjan et al. [91] were the first to our knowledge to publish work from mammals directly supporting this hypothesis. Using germ-free and conventionally raised mice, this group reported that the germ-free animals did not display an age-related increase in systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, co-housing germ-free with old—but not young—conventionally raised mice increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines [91]. Anti-TNF therapy also reversed age-related microbial changes. These data are the strongest to date suggesting the critical role of gut changes in driving age-related inflammation and provide a solid backdrop for continued investigation in this area.

Though additional research is certainly needed in this area, the aforementioned data do suggest that interventions designed to target the gut microbiome may be capable of producing beneficial effects on age-related inflammation and overall health. To date, research on such interventions is as limited as that on the aging microbiome in general. Still, within this small evidence base are some intriguing and promising findings that support the concept of intervening upon the microbiome.

More research is also needed regarding the ability to utilize probiotics as a vehicle to deliver other therapeutic compounds. Indeed, genetically modified probiotics have been purported as highly promising treatment strategies [123–125] as they offer a potentially efficacious method to deliver drugs or other therapeutic proteins with precision and a higher degree of site specificity than conventional drug regimens [126]. For instance, Steidler et al. previously reported on the utility of Lactococcus lactis as a vehicle for delivering IL-10 for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [127]. Elsewhere this strategy has been proposed as a potential method of delivering antihypertensive therapeutics [128, 129]. Given the relative infancy of this field, however, the overall body of literature in this area is sparse. Future studies are certainly warranted on the potential utility of genetically modified probiotics in the treatment of age-related inflammation and associated diseases.

As the population ages across developed nations worldwide, the need for healthcare solutions to ease the burden of age-related diseases grows. Treatments for chronic inflammation represent a particularly promising strategy given the observation of inflammation in “healthy aging” as well as nearly every age-related disorder or disease. Growing evidence indicates that the gut microbiome may represent a novel site of intervention for the prevention and/or treatment of late-life inflammation. A variety of biologic, medical, and lifestyle factors appear to contribute to gut dysbiosis in late-life, and interventions specifically designed to target these factors may be useful in restoring microbial balance and attenuating inflammation (Fig. 3). Still, much remains to be unraveled as it relates to the influence of the gut microbiome on age-related inflammation—particularly as it relates to the potential efficacy of gut-directed interventions. Thus, this field appears to offer great opportunities for aging-related research. I look forward to continued investigation in this area as it has the potential to yield tremendous breakthroughs for improving the health and quality of life of older persons.
