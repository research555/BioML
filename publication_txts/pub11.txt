Anti-inflammatory Gut Microbial Pathways Are Decreased During Crohn’s Disease Exacerbations

Crohn’s disease [CD] is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract characterised by alternating periods of exacerbation and remission. We hypothesised that changes in the gut microbiome are associated with CD exacerbations, and therefore aimed to correlate multiple gut microbiome features to CD disease activity.

Faecal microbiome data generated using whole-genome metagenomic shotgun sequencing of 196 CD patients were of obtained from the 1000IBD cohort [one sample per patient]. Patient disease activity status at time of sampling was determined by re-assessing clinical records 3 years after faecal sample production. Faecal samples were designated as taken ‘in an exacerbation’ or ‘in remission’. Samples taken ‘in remission’ were further categorised as ‘before the next exacerbation’ or ‘after the last exacerbation’, based on the exacerbation closest in time to the faecal production date. CD activity was correlated with gut microbial composition and predicted functional pathways via logistic regressions using MaAsLin software.

In total, 105 bacterial pathways were decreased during CD exacerbation (false-discovery rate [FDR] <0.1) in comparison with the gut microbiome of patients both before and after an exacerbation. Most of these decreased pathways exert anti-inflammatory properties facilitating the biosynthesis and fermentation of various amino acids [tryptophan, methionine, and arginine], vitamins [riboflavin and thiamine], and short-chain fatty acids [SCFAs].

CD exacerbations are associated with a decrease in microbial genes involved in the biosynthesis of the anti-inflammatory mediators riboflavin, thiamine, and folate, and SCFAs, suggesting that increasing the intestinal abundances of these mediators might provide new treatment opportunities. These results were generated using bioinformatic analyses of cross-sectional data and need to be replicated using time-series and wet lab experiments.

Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal [GI] tract that is characterised by alternating periods of exacerbation [active disease] and remission [quiescent disease].1,2 IBD comprises ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn’s disease [CD]; in UC, inflammation is confined to the mucosal layer of the colon, whereas in CD, inflammation can pervade every layer at any site of the GI tract.1,2 Although the factors that cause the development and onset of IBD are increasingly understood,1–4 the factors that influence the dynamics of disease activity have yet to be elucidated. A growing body of evidence, however, suggests that changes in the gut microbiome could be associated with an exacerbation of IBD.5–8 The identification of gut microbiome features associated with disease activity could thus provide novel targets for early phase intervention aimed at preventing the development of full-blown active disease or at maintaining IBD patients in a quiescent phase.

In this study, we aimed to better understand the role of the gut microbiome in disease activity in CD by analysing many different aspects of the gut microbiome, including microbial diversity, composition, the presence of genes involved in bacterial virulence, bacterial growth rates and microbial metabolic pathways in 196 CD patients, and comparing the results between patients with active and quiescent disease. Only one microbiome profile was available per patient, but because these patients were all clinically followed for several years after faecal sample production, we were able to calculate the number of days between stool sampling and nearest onset of disease activity. This allowed us to create a single virtual timeline of CD activity and to group patients into ‘before’, ‘during’, and ‘after’ exacerbation categories, which in turn allowed us to discover microbial features associated with CD activity.

The 1000IBD cohort consists of more than 1000 IBD patients. The cohort has been described previously19 and originates from the specialised IBD Center of the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology of the University Medical Center Groningen [UMCG] in Groningen, The Netherlands. The 196 CD patients included in this study, and their corresponding metagenomic sequenced stool samples, all met study inclusion criteria [Supplementary material 1, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online]. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the UMCG [IRB number 2008.338].4 More information on the 1000IBD cohort can be found at [https://1000IBD.org].

Extensive clinical phenotypes were documented for each CD patient in the study, including disease location, medication use at time of sampling, presence of perianal disease, previous surgery, stricturing phenotype, disease duration [indicated by the number of years since the Crohn’s disease diagnosis], CRP levels, and calprotectin levels. All these factors were measured around the time of faecal sampling. In addition, each patient filled in a Food Frequency Questionnaire [FFQ]19 at the time of faecal sampling, which recorded their food intake in the previous month. The FFQ answers were then transformed to grams/day in 25 food groups.

Electronic health records containing prospectively collected data on study participants were reviewed to determine disease activity status. Defining whether a patient with CD has an exacerbation can be difficult because individual clinical disease activity scores and biomarkers often do not correctly capture CD activity.20–27 Subjective disease activity scores rely heavily upon an increase in defaecation frequency and subjective abdominal complaints to determine disease activity. Biomarkers like faecal calprotectin [FC] show a highest sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of 0.82 in inflammatory bowel disease [cut-off 250 µg/g],24 but FC does not detect ileal inflammation very well and is therefore less reliable in Crohn’s disease than in ulcerative colitis.28 Other biomarkers like CRP can also increase due to other causes, such as Clostridium difficile infections.29–31 To determine whether there is an exacerbation, a gastroenterologist will often take all these measures into account, as well as the outcome of a colonoscopy [if performed], the patient’s medical history, and the results of tests to exclude infectious enteritis. Therefore, in this study, a CD exacerbation was defined based on a combination of the following criteria:

The dates of onset and recovery from recorded CD exacerbations were determined relative to the faecal sample production date. Faecal samples were thereby classified as taken ‘in an exacerbation’ or ‘in remission’. Samples ‘in remission’ were further categorised as ‘before the next exacerbation’ or ‘after the last exacerbation’. In addition, time to nearest disease exacerbation was recorded for all samples, defined as ‘days until next exacerbation’ or ‘days since last exacerbation’. When there were multiple recorded exacerbations, the closest exacerbation relative to the faecal production date was used to determine the disease activity.

Gut microbiome taxonomic compositions and functional profiles, bacterial growth rates, and abundances of virulence factor genes were determined as previously described.18

Patients produced and froze [-20°C] a stool sample at home. Frozen samples were then transported on dry ice to the UMCG and stored at -80°C. Microbial DNA was extracted from faecal samples using the Qiagen Allprep DNA/RNA Mini Kit [cat # 380204] with the addition of mechanical lysis.

Metagenomic shotgun sequencing of microbial DNA was performed at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT in Cambridge, MA, USA, using the HiSeq platform. For genomic library preparation, the Nextera XT Library preparation Kit was used.

Trimmomatic [v.0.32]32 was used to remove adapters and trim the ends of metagenomic reads, and samples with a read depth below 10 million reads were removed. Cleaned metagenomic reads were processed using a previously published pipeline.18 In brief: a. taxonomic compositions were determined by aligning reads to the reference database RefSeq NCBI database33 [accession date: June 3, 2016] using the software tools Kraken34 and Bracken35; b. functional pathways were determined using HUMAnN2 [v.0.4.0] [http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann2] and families were grouped into pathways using multi-organism database MetaCyc36; c. abundances of genes encoding virulence factors were determined by aligning reads to the Virulence Factor Database37 using DIAMOND [version 0.8.2.]38; and d. bacterial growth rates were estimated using a previously described peak-to-trough ratio algorithm.39 Microbiome features present in at least 25% of samples were tested.

We tested if the clinical characteristics, dietary patterns, Shannon Index and gene richness, and BrayCurtis distances [i.e., the inter-individual diversity or β-diversities] [Supplementary material 2, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online] differed significantly between patient groups [‘in remission’ vs ‘in an exacerbation’ and ‘before the next exacerbation’ vs ‘in exacerbation’ vs ‘after the last exacerbation’]. The chi square test was used for binary phenotypes and the WilcoxonMannWhitney U test was used for continuous phenotypes. The BenjaminiHochberg method was used to calculate the false-discovery rate [FDR] for multiple testing. An FDR <0.1 was considered statistically significant. The proportion of explained variance on β-diversity was calculated for each clinical characteristic using the ADONIS function in R [Table S2, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online].

Models were constructed considering the covariates: age, sex, read depth, body mass index [BMI], disease location, use of PPI, and use of antibiotics 3 months before sampling, all of which are known to influence the gut microbiome. The dietary covariate ‘pre-prepared meals’ differed significantly between groups [Table 1] and was added to the models. The use of steroids differed significantly between groups [p = 0.000, chi square test], but was also correlated with disease activity [rho = 0.47, p = 0.000]. Since the correlation between independent variables—collinearity—is hard to take into account into the model, we did not take steroid use into account in the linear models. However, for transparency, we have added analyses with a correction for steroid use.

Using the statistical software MaAsLin,8 we compared gut microbial features [relative abundances of species and functional pathways, abundances of virulence factors, and growth rate ratios] between: i. patients in an exacerbation versus patients in remission; ii. patients before versus in an exacerbation; and iii. patients in versus after an exacerbation. The MaAslin boosting step was turned off to ensure all independent variables were taken into account. Taxonomy and pathway relative abundances were arcsine square-root transformed. Zero inflation was considered in all tests except for growth rates. An FDR of 0.1 was used as a cut-off value for statistical significance. The function intersect in R [‘base’-package] was used to find microbiome features that were either both significantly decreased or increased before and after an exacerbation, as compared with during an exacerbation.

To test whether the microbiome can be used to monitor CD disease activity, features were linearly associated to the time to the temporally closest CD exacerbation in days. We hypothesised that if microbiota have pathogenic significance in CD, microbiome changes precede changes in disease activity. For this, an arbitrarily chosen period of 6 months was used. This meant that patients who had an exacerbation within 6 months of sampling were included in these analyses. Associations were performed using general linear models in MaAsLin, with the parameters specified above. The R function intersect was used to identify microbiome features that, in an inverse direction, shifted in the days preceding the onset of and restored quiescent balance after an exacerbation. Scripts used to perform data analyses are available at: [https://github.com/WeersmaLabIBD/Microbiome/blob/master/Protocol_ActivityCD_Marjolein_Klaassen.md].

Our cohort consisted of 196 CD patients from whom a single stool sample was collected between 2012 and 2014. At time of sampling, 24 patients [12%] were having an exacerbation, 15 patients [8%] would have their next exacerbation within 6 months, and 19 patients [10%] had had their last exacerbation less than 6 months previously. In addition, 19 patients [10%] would have their next exacerbation more than 6 months after sampling, and 119 patients [70%] had had their last exacerbation more than 6 months before sampling [Table S1, available as Supplementary data as ECCO-JCC online]. The clinical characteristics, medication use, and dietary patterns of the different groups are presented in Table 1. Only PPI use, steroid use, and pre-prepared meals differed between groups, and these features were added to the models [see Methods section].

We performed several analyses to check whether the stool samples could be grouped into ‘before’, ‘during’, and ‘after’ an exacerbation; ‘in exacerbation’ or ‘in remission’ and ‘6 months to the next exacerbation’; and ‘6 months since the last exacerbation’, without creating bias.

We therefore concluded that the patients before an exacerbation, after an exacerbation, and in remission can be grouped as single groups based on their similarities in gut microbiome composition, regardless of the days until an exacerbation.

The gut microbiome of patients during an exacerbation had a similar overall species composition compared with the gut microbiome of patients before [PCoA1 p = 0.3, PCoA2 p = 0.09, Wilcoxon test] and after an exacerbation [PCoA1 p = 0.1, PCoA2 p = 0.8, Wilcoxon test]. There were no significant differences in taxonomic diversity between patients in an exacerbation and in remission [p = 0.88, Wilcoxon test], nor in patients before, in, or after an exacerbation [p = 0.46 and p = 0.68, respectively, Wilcoxon test].

Disease activity could explain part of the variance in the gut microbiome function [R2 = 0.021, FDR = 0.007], but not of the gut microbiome taxonomical composition [R2 = 0.007, FDR = 0.007] [Table S2]. The gene richness of active patients was greater than the gene richness of patients with quiescent disease [p <0.01, Wilcoxon test] [before vs during exacerbation p = 0.03, during v. after exacerbation p = 0.01, respectively, Wilcoxon test].

Relative abundances of 169 functional pathway genes were significantly different in CD patients in an exacerbation compared with patients in remission [FDR <0.1, logistic regression test]. The highest statistical significance was found for microbial pathways involved in the biosynthesis of all-trans-farnesol [PWY_6859, FDR = 0.007], L-methionine [PWY_5345, FDR = 0.008], and polyisoprenoid [POLYISOPRENSYN_PWY, FDR = 0.008], and these were all decreased during an exacerbation [Table S3].

We also investigated the differential abundance of genes encoding for virulence factors and the predicted growth dynamics, but found no significant differences between patients in a CD exacerbation and patients in remission, nor in patients before, in, and after an exacerbation [Tables S5–S7, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online].

We next investigated whether the microbial features associated with an exacerbation also showed a linear correlation with the time [specified in days] before and after an exacerbation. Analyses were confined to patients who experienced an exacerbation in the 6 months before [n = 15] or after [n = 19] their faecal sample was collected.

The proportion of explained variance in both the taxonomic and functional composition of the variable ‘days to exacerbation’ was not significant [R = 0.004, FDR = 0.749 and R = 0.004, FDR = 0.749, respectively] [Table S2]. Therefore, correlations between proximity to an exacerbation and changes in the abundance of microbiome features were considered less reliable [Tables S8–S11, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online].

In this cohort of CD patients, we compared the gut microbiome composition of patients in an exacerbation with the microbiome of patients before and patients after an exacerbation. In previous analyses of this cohort,4,18 few pathways were associated with the established individual parameters used to define disease activity [faecal calprotectin levels >200 mg/kg faeces or HBI >4].18 In this study, we were not able to link all of these pathways to active disease, which could potentially be explained by the fact that the use of different criteria to define active disease leads to a different grouping of patients with CD based on this disease activity. Furthermore, the effect sizes of the identified pathways could be relatively small. These differences indicate the importance of well defining active disease in the context of CD.

In conclusion, we identified pro-inflammatory differences in gut microbiome function during CD disease activity. This work identified roles for several compounds in ameliorating disease activity, including vitamins and amino acids that are already available as dietary supplements at the local drugstore and could thus easily be tested. Our results could therefore be used as novel targets for translational studies trying to modulate the function of the gut microbiome in an anti-inflammatory manner.
