Does the Gut Microbiome Play a Role in Obesity in Type 1 Diabetes? Unanswered Questions and Review of the Literature

Evidence suggests that type 1 diabetes (T1D) risk and progression are associated with gut bacterial imbalances. Children with either T1D or islet antibody positivity exhibit gut dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) characterized by lower gram-positive to gram-negative gut bacterial ratios compared to healthy individuals, leading to a pro-inflammatory milieu. In addition, specific gut microbiome changes, including increased virulence factors, elevated phage, prophage, and motility genes, and higher amplitude stress responses, have been identified in individuals who have or are progressing towards T1D. Additionally, gut microbiome differences are associated with and thought to contribute to obesity, a comorbidity that is increasingly prevalent among persons with T1D. Obesity in T1D is problematic because individuals with obesity progress faster to T1D, have reduced insulin sensitivity compared to their lean counterparts, and have higher risk of complications. Animal and human studies suggest higher relative abundance of bacterial taxa associated with changes in bile acid and short chain fatty acid biosynthesis in obesity. However, it is unknown to what extent the gut microbiome plays a role in obesity in T1D and these worse outcomes. In this review, we aim to evaluate potential gut microbiome changes and associations in individuals with T1D who are obese, highlighting the specific gut microbiome changes associated with obesity and with T1D development. We will identify commonalities and differences in microbiome changes and examine potential microbiota-host interactions and the metabolic pathways involved. Finally, we will explore interventions that may be of benefit to this population, in order to modify disease and improve outcomes.

Type 1 diabetes is associated with long-term complications including cardiovascular disease and is the leading cause of kidney failure and retinopathy (Varma et al., 2016; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Obesity in type 1 diabetes (T1D) is problematic because it further increases the risk for complications and mortality (Conway et al., 2009). There is increasing evidence suggesting that type 1 diabetes (T1D) risk and progression are associated with gut microbial imbalance (Brugman et al., 2006; de Kort et al., 2011; Brown et al., 2011; Giongo et al., 2011; de Goffau et al., 2013; Murri et al., 2013; de Goffau et al., 2014; Mejía-León et al., 2014; Kostic et al., 2015; O'Callaghan and van Sinderen, 2016; Zheng et al., 2018). Separately, gut bacterial imbalances are associated also with obesity (Musso et al., 2010). The development of both obesity and T1D are complex processes that include the interaction between genetic susceptibility, immune system activation or inflammation, and environmental factors, all of which are poorly understood. The gut microbiome is becoming increasingly recognized in each condition as an important link connecting genes to the environment and immune system activation.

Obesity is now prevalent (up to 46.1% in some populations) and increasing among children and adults with T1D (Nathan et al., 2009; Conway et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010; Redondo et al., 2016; Minges et al., 2017; Corbin et al., 2018) ( Table 1 ). This trend is especially problematic, as obesity is associated with worse T1D outcomes, including higher risk for short term complications, such as hypoglycemia and long-term complications, such as cardiovascular disease (Redondo et al., 2012; Redondo et al., 2016; Ferrara et al., 2017; Corbin et al., 2018). However, it is unknown to what extent the gut microbiome plays a role in obesity in T1D and associated adverse outcomes. Whether and how the gut microbiome influences obesity trends in T1D similar to what has been shown in the general population is an important area to investigate. In this review, we will explore the gut microbial compositions associated with T1D and obesity and discuss how the gut microbiome may be contributing to the rising rate of obesity in T1D by reviewing the current literature. We will then summarize the literature focused on potential therapeutic effects of intestinal microbiome manipulation.

The rates of obesity worldwide have tripled since 1975 (WHO, 2018). Over 1.9 billion adults are overweight and at least 650 million of those are obese. Similarly, about 39 million children under the age of 5 years and 340 million children and adolescents between 5-19 years of age globally are either overweight or obese (WHO, 2018). Gut microbiome differences and dysbioses have been associated with overweight, obesity and insulin resistance in non-diabetic children and adults (Cani et al., 2007; Turnbaugh et al., 2009; Musso et al., 2010; Del Chierico et al., 2018; Peters et al., 2018).

Other metabolic effects of the gut microbiome on obesity have been described. For example, some studies suggest that a bile acid (BA)-gut microbiome axis contributes to insulin sensitivity and obesity (Sun et al., 2018). Consistent with this idea, the gut microbiome plays a major role in BA metabolism (Hullar et al., 2014; Ridlon et al., 2014) and evidence suggests that BAs are involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (Kars et al., 2010; Haeusler et al., 2013; Kuipers et al., 2014; Wewalka et al., 2014). It is thought that BAs can impact insulin sensitivity via effects on the nuclear farsenoid X receptor (FXR) and the membrane-bound G-protein coupled receptor, TGR5 (Kuipers et al., 2014). Therefore, the gut microbial composition can alter insulin sensitivity by changing the amount and type of secondary BAs formed, thereby affecting FXR and TGR5 signaling. Indeed, one human study showed that the use of oral vancomycin altered the gut microbiome and caused a decrease in secondary BAs that were associated with worsened insulin sensitivity (Vrieze et al., 2014). Another study showed that oral metformin altered the gut microbiome composition in obese adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) which was associated with secondary BA and FXR changes, resulting in improved insulin sensitivity (Sun et al., 2018).

Type 1 Diabetes Exchange clinic registry data between the years of 2010 and 2012 indicate that the prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile for age and sex) was 13.5% overall in adolescents with established T1D and was higher in black/African American (17.9%) and Hispanic/Latinx (15.9%) children (Minges et al., 2017). Epidemiological studies have also shown increased prevalence of obesity among adults with T1D (Nathan et al., 2009; Conway et al., 2010). Further, some data show an increasing rate of obesity among people with T1D compared to general population trends (DuBose et al., 2015). Obese children progress faster to T1D and display differences in endogenous insulin secretion compared to their lean counterparts (Redondo et al., 2012; Ferrara et al., 2017). Obesity also reduces insulin sensitivity (Redondo et al., 2012; Ferrara et al., 2017), which is associated with higher exogenous insulin needs, chronic inflammation, and higher risk for hypoglycemia, dyslipidemia, and increased risk of long-term complications (Redondo et al., 2016; Corbin et al., 2018).

It appears that gut microbiome changes are associated either with T1D development (Brugman et al., 2006; de Kort et al., 2011; Brown et al., 2011; Giongo et al., 2011; de Goffau et al., 2013; Murri et al., 2013; de Goffau et al., 2014; Mejía-León et al., 2014; Kostic et al., 2015; O'Callaghan and van Sinderen, 2016; Zheng et al., 2018) or with obesity in non-diabetic cohorts (Cani et al., 2007; Turnbaugh et al., 2009; Musso et al., 2010; Del Chierico et al., 2018; Peters et al., 2018). However, the gut microbiomes of lean and obese individuals with T1D have never been compared. Further, it is not known whether metabolic differences seen in obese individuals with T1D compared to lean individuals with T1D are associate with gut microbiome and metabolite differences. Notably, there is little information concerning SCFA and BA levels in T1D individuals who are obese despite the known mechanistic roles of these molecules in the pathophysiology of other gut microbiome dysbioses and conditions. A study by our group is currently underway aiming to address the lack of knowledge concerning the composition and potential role of the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites in lean and obese T1D individuals and potential associations with metabolic health. Data from this study could yield mechanistic insights that can be translated into novel therapeutic modalities.

Several interventions to modulate the gut microbiome and disease state have shown promising results in either T1D or obesity and might be worth considering in an obese T1D population. Yet questions remain as to whether modulation of the microbiome could have beneficial effects in a population of individuals with T1D and obesity. Here, we highlight a few potential options ( Figure 1 ).

First, one must consider lifestyle interventions as an easy and safe intervention. Nutrition and exercise are important therapeutic approaches to improve glycemic control and manage body weight. There are consensus guidelines on the management of obesity and T2D (American Diabetes Association, 2020) but these guidelines are lacking when addressing obesity in a T1D population. Restoration of the gut microbiome balance has been shown to be influenced by or associated with a healthy BMI and increased physical activity levels in a population of adults with T1D (Stewart et al., 2017). Therefore, increased physical activity levels and a healthy diet along with the associated improvements in body composition and glycemic control could be an easy target to restore the dysbiosis that is likely present in T1D individuals with obesity. However, as the response to these interventions can vary from one individual to another (Zeevi et al., 2015), an important first step would be to understand the role of the gut microbiome in driving host energy metabolism and macronutrient balance (the balance between dietary energy harvest and expenditure) in this population in order to provide a more personalized lifestyle approach. It is postulated that there is a microbe-mediated increase in energy uptake that has been estimated to account for 10% of the energy intake among those consuming a western diet (McNeil, 1984).

Probiotics are viable microorganisms that have health promoting effects on the host when administered in adequate amounts as food ingredients (Rastall et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2013; Davis, 2016). Studies have shown an effect for probiotics containing Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, or Saccharomyces on weight loss and/or fat deposition in overweight adults (Rastall et al., 2005; Crovesy et al., 2017). In addition, multi-species probiotics restore gut microbiota profiles and promote epithelial tight junction integrity and reduce inflammation (Carvalho and Abdalla Saad, 2013; Chibbar et al., 2017), thereby preventing fat accumulation and weight gain (Everard et al., 2013; Davis, 2016). Multi-strain probiotics are available as a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacilli (L. casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus); bifidobacteria (B. longum, B. breve, and B. infantis); and Streptococcus (S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus) (Shen et al., 2013; Chibbar et al., 2017). Multi-strain probiotics have been also studied in T1D. An Italian study showed that supplementation with Lactobacillaceae-enriched multi-strain probiotics, given alone or along with retinoic acid, decreased the risk of developing diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice (Dolpady et al., 2016). In humans, multi-strain probiotics have also been studied in the modulation of the immune system in 25 unaffected siblings of T1D patients who are considered at risk for T1D development. Results show that the probiotic was safe and well tolerated and that systemic inflammation was modestly reduced in response to the probiotic intake (Cabrera et al., 2022). In this study, markers of inflammation were significantly reduced after 6-weeks of probiotic supplementation (p = 0.017). For example, probiotic-associated decrease in the ratio of memory: naïve CD4+ cells were demonstrated, consistent with lowering of systemic inflammation. They also noted a post-supplement enrichment of the family Lachnospiraceae, producers of the anti-inflammatory butyrate. Therefore, this multi-strain probiotic ‘mixture’ of lactobacilli might also have potential use in an obese T1D population.

Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients capable of selectively stimulating growth and/or activity of fermenters and high SCFA producers, thereby providing health-promoting effects on host energy balance (Lim et al., 2005; Roberfroid et al., 2010). Prebiotics can, therefore, modify the gut microbiota to mitigate the risk of dysbiosis and associated gut and systemic pathologies.

Another prebiotic of interest is inulin. Inulin is a prebiotic that has been studied in both T1D and obesity separately and that targets gut microbiota and thereby influences microbial composition and activity. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of 14 healthy, overweight to obese men, inulin promoted SCFA production with significantly higher plasma acetate after ingestion compared to placebo (van der Beek et al., 2018). A randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 38 children aged 8 to 17 years old with T1D using either placebo or a prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin for 12 weeks showed that C-peptide was significantly higher (P=0.029) in the prebiotic group, along with a modest improvement in intestinal permeability (P=0.076) (Ho et al., 2019). Although the authors did not look at microbial metabolites and metabolic pathways, they reported a significant increase in the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium (a known bacterial fermenter) in the prebiotic group.

The effect of metformin on the microbiome has also been studied. Metformin is a first-line drug used to treat T2D, as it improves insulin sensitivity and inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis. In adolescents with T1D, metformin use, in addition to insulin therapy, reduced total daily insulin doses (Libman et al., 2015). In another study, metformin improved whole-body and peripheral insulin sensitivity in T1D adolescents who were overweight and obese (Cree-Green et al., 2019). Results of preclinical animal studies suggest that metformin changes gut microbiome composition (Lee and Ko, 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). More recently, it has been shown that the therapeutic benefit of metformin may be due, in part, to alterations in the gut microbiome that modulate host energy metabolism (Ridlon et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2021). Several studies of different ethnic populations with T2D and healthy individuals have demonstrated that metformin alters gut microbiome composition and is associated with changes in SCFA, BA, and C-peptide levels (Lee et al., 2021). A study in humans by Sun et al. (Ridlon et al., 2014) showed that exposure to metformin for 3 days in adults with newly diagnosed T2D (who were treatment naïve) markedly reduced Baceteroides abundance in fecal samples, with the most striking decrease seen in Bacteroides (B.) fragilis. Metformin treatment also increased levels of the secondary BA glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) in the gut through decreasing the abundance of B. fragilis and its bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in the intestines (Ridlon et al., 2014). In turn, GUDCA functioned as an FXR antagonist in the gut to improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control (Ridlon et al., 2014). Elevated tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) levels were also observed. These findings suggest a key role for microbiota-derived changes in GUDCA and the FXR axis as a mediator of metformin’s actions.

Metformin also promotes colonization by SCFA-producing bacteria such as Akkermansia (Utzschneider et al., 2016; de la Cuesta-Zuluaga et al., 2017). SCFAs in turn can regulate the secretion of GLP-1, which has been shown to enhance the metabolic effects of BAs that signal through another receptor (the Takeda G-protein coupled receptor 5, or TGR5) (Thomas et al., 2009), indicating synergy between metformin’s effects on SCFAs and its effects on BAs. These therapeutically relevant insights into the emerging field of altered gut microbiota-mediated BA and SCFA signaling and T2D pathophysiology provide the rationale for considering metformin use to modify the gut microbiome in T1D individuals with obesity.

Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) is a procedure in which fecal matter is collected from a healthy donor and placed into the gastrointestinal tract of a patient. Recent studies have explored the use of FMT in T1D as well as in obesity. For example, in a double-blind randomized placebo control pilot study (Allegretti et al., 2021) using FMT in 22 obese adults, significant improvements were seen in glucose area under the curve (AUC) at 12 weeks compared to baseline, and in the insulin AUC at 6 weeks compared to baseline in the FMT group compared to placebo. These findings suggest that FMTs may have a potential role in preventing the development of metabolic syndrome in patients with obesity. However, the same group (Allegretti et al., 2020) had shown earlier that although FMTs were safe and tolerable in this group of participants, it did not reduce BMI. They did show, however, that FMTs led to sustained changes in the intestinal microbiome and BA profiles that were similar to those of the lean donor.

However, the FDA recently issued a warning against FMTs (US Food and Drug Administration, 2022), commonly used to treat chronic Clostridium Difficile infections, given that two immunocompromised individuals developed severe life-threatening infections from an antibiotic resistant strain of E. coli present in the donor stool, resulting in one of the two dying. FMT donors are screened for chronic and serious transmissible infections, such as HIV and hepatitis, but their samples are not tested for drug resistant strains. Yet, with more awareness and understanding of this procedure and its safety, FMTs may hold some promise in treatment of obese T1D individuals due to a potentially longer sustained effect on recipient colonic colonization (or decolonization of pathogenic strains) compared to the use of probiotics, for example, that tend to produce a more short-term change in the gut microbiome composition.

Obesity is a concerning and increasing health problem among individuals with T1D, and it is important to consider the potential role of the gut microbiome in obesity in these individuals (Musso et al., 2010). As the obesity epidemic can be viewed as an extension of the hygiene hypothesis, which stipulates that improved sanitation, widespread antibiotic use, and dietary habits in developed countries may predispose to metabolic diseases, the deviant gut microbiota may mediate these associations. In this case, this population of individuals with T1D and obesity should be viewed as facing a ‘double whammy’ given the hygiene hypothesis has been speculated to contribute to autoimmune disease development, hence targeting the gut microbiome is even more compelling. Several questions remain unanswered. Does the gut microbiome of obese individuals with T1D mimic that of obese non-diabetic individuals or that of T1D individuals or a combination of both? Are the microbiome-metabolite-metabolic pathways similarly involved in obese T1D individuals? Can we ascertain causality between the gut microbiome and obesity in T1D? And finally, do lifestyle changes, certain supplements and medications, or FMTs produce similar effects in this population and who would be a good candidate for each intervention?

Importantly, future studies should examine the gut microbiome of individuals with T1D and obesity and ascertain the nature of the relationship, focusing on the gut microbial functional capacity in this population to better understand the hormonal, immunomodulatory, and metabolic mechanisms underlying the microbiome-host interactions. This would allow for a more targeted intervention aimed at deficient metabolic pathways and restoration of the functional capacity of the disrupted microbiome. It will be essential to design future clinical trials to assess the health benefits derived from microbiome modulating interventions on the treatment of obesity in individuals with T1D and assess the long-term safety of gut microbiota manipulation.
