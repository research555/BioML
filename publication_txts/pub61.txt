The role of the gut microbiome and exercise in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

In recent years, the human gut microbiome has been found to influence a multitude of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome, with its components type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. It is recognized to be mainly influenced by environmental factors, such as lifestyle, but also genetics may play a role. The interaction of gut microbiota and obesity has been widely studied, but in regard to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as a manifestation of obesity and insulin resistance, the causal role of the gut microbiome has not been fully established. The mechanisms by which the gut microbiome influences lipid accumulation, inflammatory responses, and occurrence of fibrosis in the liver are a topic of active research.

In addition, the influence of exercise on gut microbiome composition is also being investigated. In clinical trials, exercise reduced hepatic steatosis independently of weight reduction. Other studies indicate that exercise may modulate the gut microbiome. This puts forward the question whether exercise could mediate its beneficial effects on NAFLD via changes in gut microbiome. Yet, the specific mechanisms underlying this potential connection are largely unknown. Thus, associative evidence from clinical trials, as well as mechanistic studies in vivo are called for to elucidate the relationship between exercise and the gut microbiome in NAFLD. Here, we review the current literature on exercise and the gut microbiome in NAFLD.

Obesity has been on the rise since several decades and it is a major contributor to mortality across the globe.1 Globally, approximately 38% of adults are estimated will be overweight [Body Mass Index (BMI) above 25 kg/m2] by 2030. In parallel, obesity-associated disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), metabolic syndrome, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are increasingly prevalent, as well. NAFLD can be regarded as the liver component of the metabolic syndrome and it is defined as at least 5% of fat deposit in hepatocytes. Driven by insulin resistance, it typically develops in a subset of obese patients. Currently, it is estimated that 25% of the global population has some degree of NAFLD and this number is expected to increase further with the increase of obesity and T2DM.2,3 The first stage of the NAFLD disease spectrum, simple steatosis, is generally believed to be rather benign in terms of liver and cardiovascular prognosis. Yet, a subset of patients develop progressive NAFLD stages, that is, inflammation [non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)] and liver fibrosis. These progressive stages are associated with an increase in mortality and morbidity, both directly in regards to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as cardiovascular and overall mortality.4–6 Since NAFLD and its advanced stages are caused by a set of metabolic dysfunctions, metabolic-dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is now suggested as a new definition for the condition.7 In this review, the term NAFLD is still used.

Although various studies have found that the gut microbiome can influence NAFLD, there is still debate on the mechanisms. It is suggested that either the bacteria themselves or metabolites produced by intestinal bacteria are transported over the intestinal lumen and reach the liver via the portal vein, where they affect hepatic metabolic and/or inflammatory pathways. Among the metabolites suggested to influence NAFLD are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, that may protect from steatohepatitis, whereas other metabolites, such as endogenous alcohol, may promote steatohepatitis.21,22 However, there is conflicting evidence in regards to the specific bacterial species involved in the different disease etiologies and there is a lack of causal evidence of their effect on the diseases mentioned.23–26

There have been multiple efforts to identify a signature change in the gut microbiome of patients with NAFLD compared with healthy controls. Although the results of these studies cannot be compared side by side, it is evident that the microbiome associated with NAFLD has lower richness, but the relative difference in bacterial composition between NAFLD patients and healthy controls is not yet clear. For instance, while some studies found that the gut microbiome of NAFLD patients has an increased abundance of Fusobacteria and reduced amounts of Oscillospira and Ruminococcus,27 children with NAFLD have been shown to have more Ruminococcus and Oscillospira than healthy children.28 It is clear that further research is needed to determine what differentiates the gut microbiome in patients with NAFLD from that of healthy subjects. Therefore, it is also not known what drives the differences in the gut microbiome compositions between patients with NAFLD and healthy controls, and how this affects disease state or progression. It has been proposed that the gut microbiome can increase energy uptake and initiate inflammation, two factors contributing a dysfunctional metabolism,20,26,29,30 but the microbiome might also affect other processes associated with NAFLD such as insulin resistance, and metabolism of bile acids and choline.31

In the last few years, several studies focusing on microbiome and metabolome data have made it evident that many factors are involved in the association of hepatic lipid content and the gut microbiome. These factors include the direct effects of the microbes themselves, such as by facilitating energy harvest and their metabolic mechanisms, as well as their secreted metabolites that, via the portal vein, affect hepatic metabolic pathways. Among these factors are the SCFAs, LPS, and ethanol. In the remainder of this review, we will discuss several roles of the intestinal microbiome in influencing hepatic lipid metabolism.

A direct link between the gut microbiome and the hepatic lipid content is provided by the fact that certain microbiota can facilitate energy harvest. In various studies that have mainly been performed in mice, the effect of the microbiome on obesity was shown to be mediated via an enhanced energy harvest, and some of these studies have also shown an effect on NAFLD/hepatic lipid accumulation.

Taken together, there is mounting evidence from mouse studies indicating the importance of diet composition and the gut microbiome on weight gain, and this likely also holds true for humans as well. Yet, the mechanistic insights here are sparse and might be pointing towards an effect on (hepatic) fatty-acid oxidation. Also, increased energy harvest by the gut microbiome is likely a major driving force in NAFLD.

SCFAs such as butyric, acetic, and propionic acid are produced by bacterial fermentation of nutritional fibers and other macronutrients in the gut.20 SCFAs function as energy substrates but they can also modulate energy metabolism, for instance, by suppression of adipocyte leptin secretion, resulting in induced satiety and hence reduced food intake.53 Thus, SCFAs can link microbiome and host metabolism in intricate ways.

Thus, SCFAs may hold promise in their effect on human energy metabolism, though the effect may be limited in the obese population and their effect in patients with NAFLD is still to be studied. Interestingly, certain SCFAs can inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs), and several HDACs are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.66,67 Altogether, there lays a great potential in further elucidating the mechanisms of SCFAs in energy metabolism in NAFLD subjects.

The liver is connected to the intestine through the portal vein, and approximately 70–75% of the blood that reaches the liver is drawn from veins surrounding the gut and transported through the portal vein.68 This means that bacterial components and metabolites can readily be directed from the gut to the liver. It has been estimated that more than 300 volatile organic compounds are produced by the gut that reach the liver where they might affect metabolic processes.69 Thus, the permeability of the gut might be crucial in controlling the amount of bacterial compounds that can directly reach the liver. Currently, there is no causal evidence of a ‘leaky gut,’ but we will cover some of the small murine and human studies that have been reported.

A hypothesis that is based on this liver connection suggests that due to increased gut permeability, microbe-derived substances can reach the liver, to a higher degree. These substances include the abovementioned SCFAs, but also metabolic compounds such as choline, ethanol, bile acids, and small bacterial components such as LPS or flagellins. An increased gut permeability was seen in mice fed a high-fat diet.70 Even more interestingly, the degree of liver steatosis correlated with gut permeability in a study of patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. However, the presence of NASH was not linked to gut permeability. This is an interesting finding, and the evidence seems quite robust considering the study size (35 subjects with NAFLD, compared with 27 with celiac disease, and 24 healthy subjects).71 In contrast, a more recent review showed that less than half the patients with NAFLD had increased gut permeability.72 Thus, even though the translocation of molecules due to a ‘leaky gut’ may exacerbate the disease in a subset of subjects, it is not the only driving force in NAFLD. It is still of major interest to elucidate which patients with NAFLD have leaky gut and which do not, as this may seem to be an important initiating factor in the pathogenesis of NAFLD for many patients. Finally, an increased gut permeability seems to be one of the first mechanisms that allow for further injury by microbial produced compounds, thus it may be a key factor in the connection of the gut microbiome with NAFLD. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on how to assess gut permeability, and causal evidence is severely lacking. Potentially, a combination of several assays is the best way forward.73

Bile acids have diverse functions that originally were thought only to be the emulsification of lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins in the gut to facilitate intestinal uptake, as well as the secretion of endogenous metabolites in the hepatobiliary system. Nowadays it is acknowledged that bile acids also have an important role in regulating lipid, carbohydrate, and cholesterol metabolism, and signaling pathways.74 Bile acids can be categorized into primary and secondary bile acids. Primary bile acids are conjugated products from the liver bile acid pool, while secondary bile acids have been deconjugated by the gut microbiome. A change in their metabolism and composition can lead to damaging effects on the liver.27,74 It is also thought that farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear transcription factor of which bile acids are endogenous ligands, might play a role in NAFLD due to its impact on the oxidation of lipids and affect the metabolism of cholesterol and carbohydrates.74 Furthermore, deletion of FXR leads to an increased inflammation in the liver in a WTD mice model75 and development of HCC markers induced by a bile acid (cholic acid),76 which indicates its pivotal role on the bile acid metabolism and the liver.

There is some evidence of the relation between bile acids, the microbiome and NAFLD in humans. Several microbial pathways related to bile acid biosynthesis were detected in high abundance in subjects with NAFLD compared with controls. Furthermore, subjects with NAFLD and particularly NASH have been shown to have an elevated secondary bile acid production. However, it appears that subjects with cirrhosis have less fecal bile acids, which can be seen as a proxy for the decrease of the conversion of primary to secondary bile acids. The effects on the bile acid pool may thus be another pathway for further injury to the liver, and according to some studies may contribute to the persistence of NAFLD.27

Ethanol is an important contributor of alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) which can ultimately lead to similar endpoints as NAFLD, namely fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver failure.77 It has been demonstrated that the gut microbiota can produce both ethanol and methanol, and since patients with NAFLD have similar histopathology compared with AFLD subjects, a hypothesis evolved that the endogenous alcohol production by the gut microbiota may be a major factor in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.78–80 This hypothesis is supported by a study that found genetically obese mice had an increased intestinal ethanol production compared with lean mice.81

Despite these convincing studies with the K. pneumoniae strain, it has been suggested that increased ethanol levels in patients with NAFLD may be due to insulin-dependent impairments of the alcohol dehydrogenase pathway rather than an increase in endogenous alcohol production from the gut.85 Thus, endogenous ethanol production by gut microbiota seems very likely to be one of the major culprits in the development of liver steatosis in some, but surely not all NAFLD patients.

The term ‘metabolic endotoxemia’ is used to describe an increase in LPS-containing bacteria in the gut and an increased LPS concentration in plasma, this was found in mice fed a high-fat diet.62 There are multiple studies suggesting that endotoxemia is a part of the pathophysiology of obesity; however, studies specific to NAFLD are lacking. In addition to this, the assays for LPS in plasma can be unreliable.86 There is a need for more rigorous analyses of the assays used in these studies to improve the hypotheses and research on endotoxemia.

Choline is a compound that for decades has been implicated with fatty liver. Rats fed a choline-deficient diet develop steatosis due to dysfunctional hepatic lipoprotein metabolism.87 Since phosphatidylcholine is a major component of lipoproteins, choline deficiency leads to improper formation of lipoproteins. Choline deficiency also leads to a hepatic uptake of free fatty acids and therefore triglyceride build-up in the liver, but this can be reversed shortly after returning choline to the diet.88 Providing mice with antibiotics upon a phosphatidylcholine challenge affects choline metabolism by suppression of conversion of phosphatidylcholine into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) by the gut microbiota, suggesting that some effects of choline on NAFLD may be regulated via the gut microbiome.89 Indeed, a small study of 15 subjects placed on a choline-deficient diet detected specific microbiota markers of NAFLD in their feces.90 Other supporting evidence comes from patients with parenteral nutrition who suffer from choline deficiency and therefore had significantly increased liver enzymes and liver steatosis.91,92 To conclude, the evidence of the effects of choline deficiency on NAFLD are quite robust, and it seems likely that they are regulated by the gut microbiome; however, the specific pathways and microbes responsible for this effect remain to be identified.

Recent rodent studies investigating the effects of exercise on NAFLD indicate that exercise improves liver status through mechanisms that include hepatic or peripheral lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and inflammatory responses in the liver. These effects of exercise on the liver can be mediated via connections with other organs, including adipose and muscle tissues. As with many of the previous aspects discussed in this review, verification of the role of exercise on hepatic fat content in humans is warranted.93 Next, we review the evidence on these mechanisms in order to facilitate the understanding of the connection between the gut microbiome, exercise, and NAFLD further on in this review.

Various randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported a beneficial effect of exercise on hepatic steatosis.94–99 A recent meta-analysis of 17 such RCTs in NAFLD patients revealed a significant decrease in intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content independently of weight reduction, upon exercise. On average, a 3.31% decrease in IHTG content was measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) or by liver biopsy.14 Since there is a big variation in the type, duration, and frequency of exercise, it is still unclear what kind of exercise is the most beneficial. However, the latest literature suggests that low-intensity training, and especially resistance training (RT), is not sufficiently effective to reduce IHTG content.100 It is obvious that there is a need for more studies to further conclude which is the most beneficial type and frequency of exercise in the management of NAFLD. Additionally, the absolute decrease in IHTG content that is seen in most studies is clinically rather irrelevant due to small effect size, but it can open future insights to the pathophysiology of NAFLD and its progressive stages.

Exercise regulated lipid metabolism in parallel with an improvement in NAFLD, as was shown in a study in which rats with NAFLD received 6 weeks of training.18 After these 6 weeks of training, the improved liver histology was accompanied by reductions in the hepatic mRNA expression of gene-encoding enzymes involved in lipogenesis, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (Srebp1c), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (Cebpa) and the fatty-acid transporter (Cd36). In another study, 20 male C57BL/6J ApoE-KO mice that were fed a high-fat diet underwent a swimming exercise for 12 weeks. This exercise resulted in improvements in insulin sensitivity, and in reductions in lipid concentrations in plasma, as well as in liver.106 Exercise increased the relative protein expression of enzymes involved in hepatic fatty-acid oxidation, such as PPAR-γ, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1). In the ApoE-KO mouse model, the exercise results in more fatty-acid oxidation. This suggests that exercise enhances hepatic fatty-acid oxidation resulting in a reduced liver lipid content and increased insulin sensitivity.

Exercise likely improves hepatic as well as peripheral insulin sensitivity of obese insulin-resistant subjects. Improved insulin sensitivity will likely cause an increased glucose uptake in muscles and liver for glycogen synthesis, but also the inhibition of glucose secretion and stimulation of DNL by insulin is likely to be increased through the improvement of insulin sensitivity.98,107 As seen with the exercised ApoE-KO mice mentioned above, exercise might stimulate the hepatic oxidation of fatty acids, affecting not only the hepatic fat content, but also, as a consequence, hepatic insulin sensitivity. Importantly, exercise might result in a decreased lipolysis, as a reflection of improved insulin sensitivity in adipose and other tissues; hence, reduced flux of fatty acids from tissues to the liver and thereby reduced accumulation of triglycerides. Moreover, after a high-intensity exercise training for 4 weeks, postprandial circulating lipid peroxidation levels were reduced,101 suggesting hepatic oxidative stress was reduced by aerobic exercise.108 This, altogether, would indicate improvements of liver status. However, the evidence of impact of different types of exercise on insulin sensitivity is controversial; sprint–interval training did not have significant impact on either peripheral or hepatic insulin sensitivity, but other types of aerobic exercise improved peripheral insulin sensitivity.98,107

Inflammation is the hallmark of the advanced stages of NAFLD which eventually led to fibrosis in the liver. Oh et al.103 studied the effect of high-intensity interval aerobic training (HIAT), RT or moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on liver fat, as well as liver stiffness as assessed by vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), a validated non-invasive parameter of NAFLD-related fibrosis.109 Hepatic fat was reduced in both HIAT and MICT groups, but reduction of hepatic fat stiffness was only found in the HIAT group. These differences could be due to differences in intensity of exercise. Another study did not find any significant improvements in liver fibrosis assessed by VCTE when comparing baseline and endpoint upon exercise.110 On the other hand, promising results were presented from a 12-week aerobic-exercise intervention with significantly reduced fibrosis at endpoint biopsies, as well as improved liver stiffness scores measured with VCTE, and improved steatosis measured with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP).111

With respect to the effect of exercise on inflammation and hepatic stiffness, it has been suggested that exercise restores the phagocytic function of damaged Kupffer cells, hepatic macrophages that play a central role in the pathophysiology of hepatic inflammation,112 which may in turn decrease inflammation and fibrosis.103 However, the effect of exercise on more progressive forms of NAFLD such as steatohepatitis and fibrosis, has been shown to be quite modest; though, exercise may be less efficient in this group of patients because they may exhibit a decreased maximal workload capacity compared with patients with liver steatosis due to increased diastolic dysfunction.113 In a mouse model after an intense 8-week exercise intervention, high-fat induced NASH mice showed histological improvements in liver injury and also in the structure and enzyme activities of hepatic mitochondria.114 Altogether, more insights into the effect of exercise specifically on non-alcoholic-related liver outcomes are called for.

Exercise has not only been reported to affect body weight and hepatic fat content in various animal models, as well as in some human studies, it also has profound effects on the gut microbiome. The effects can be detected either on the compositional level or the metabolites produced by the gut microbiome. However, the exact role of the gut microbiome in controlling or mediating the effects of exercise in (obese) subjects is still under investigation. Table 6 summarizes the studies on the effect of exercise on the gut microbiome in obese populations. We will highlight some of these studies.

Studies on exercise in rodent NAFLD models investigating the gut microbiome and its metabolites are not so numerous. Among the few is one that shows that high-intensity exercise training for 6 weeks improved gut microbiome diversity but not body weight of C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet.117 More specifically, the training increased alpha diversity and the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio. In contrast, another study with the same mice model showed a significant decrease in the ratio of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes midway of a voluntary 12-week exercise intervention, while after the whole voluntary exercise period, the ratio was slightly increased, albeit its statistical significance. The body weight was also affected by exercise.118 Interestingly, low or moderate training had only minimal impact in modulating the gut microbiome in mice fed high-fat diet after 8 weeks of treadmill training.119 The abundance of Proteus and Vagococcus were changed upon exercise. However, the body composition was changed by the exercise. In diabetic rats, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) improved metabolic health without reshaping the gut microbiota.120

To the best of our knowledge, the impact of exercise specifically on the gut microbiome and its subsequent effects on NAFLD has not been studied in humans. Thus, when researchers suggest that exercise might affect NAFLD (in part) due to modulation of the intestinal microbiome, this is attributed to effects seen on obesity, an important contributor to NAFLD. Interestingly, there is only one rodent study addressing the modulatory effect of exercise on NAFLD through gut microbiome.18 In this study, the effect of a controlled exercise program was comprehensively investigated on the gut–liver axis in juvenile rats fed a high-fat diet with promising results, when the mice were introduced on an exercise program with aerobic and RT for 5 weeks after the development of features for obesity and NAFLD, which were induced by a 6-week high-fat diet before the start of the exercise program.

Altogether, proper knowledge about the mechanisms involved in the effects of exercise on NAFLD in humans is lacking. However, extrapolating the very few rodent studies to the human situation, one can speculate that exercise might have a potential beneficial effect on the gut microbiome and hence gut microbiome might produce metabolites that affect NAFLD and obesity. Figure 1 illustrates the main mechanisms via which exercise and the gut microbiome may affect NAFLD. To address the exact mechanisms of exercise and gut microbiome in NAFLD, more studies, both clinical and preclinical, should be employed.

There are multiple mechanisms through which exercise can affect NAFLD, and the gut microbiome is likely a connector in some.

In conclusion, exercise may affect NAFLD both directly and indirectly via effects on the gut microbiome. More causal evidence is needed to further elucidate whether some of the abovementioned mechanisms on the gut–liver axis work in unison, or affect each other. It is paramount that more studies should focus specifically on the mechanisms in NAFLD rather than in obesity. In general, there is a lack of studies which investigate the mechanistic effects of exercise on the gut microbiome, and whether this may influence NAFLD and its progressive stages.
