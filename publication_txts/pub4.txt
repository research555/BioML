The gut microbiome and antibiotic resistome of chronic diarrhea rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and its similarity to the human gut microbiome

Chronic diarrhea is a common disease causing morbidity and mortality of captive rhesus macaques (RMs, Macaca mulatta). Chronic diarrhea in RMs is typically characterized by long-term diarrhea and a weak response to antibiotic treatment. Diarrhea is also a common disease in humans and can cause death. However, the etiology of about half of diarrheal cases of humans is still unclear. Therefore, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing to characterize the differences in the gut microbiome and resistome of chronic diarrhea RMs and asymptomatic individuals.

Our results showed Lactobacillus spp. (mainly L. johnsonii, L. reuteri and L. amylovorus) were significantly depleted in chronic diarrhea RM guts compared to asymptomatic individuals (5.2 vs 42.4%). Functional annotation of genes suggested these Lactobacillus spp. carried genes involved in the adhesion of intestinal epithelial cells and production of bacteriocin. Chronic diarrhea RM guts also had a significantly greater abundance of many other gut bacteria, including mucin-degrading bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. The metabolic pathways of chronic diarrhea RM gut microbiome were enriched in aerobactin biosynthesis, while the metabolic pathways of asymptomatic RM gut microbiome were enriched in the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Chronic diarrhea RM guts had a significantly greater abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), such as ermF, aph(3’)-IIIa, ermB, and floR. The strains isolated from feces and tissue fluid of chronic diarrhea RMs had higher resistance rates to the majority of tested antibiotics, but not cephamycin and carbapenem antibiotics. Gut microbial composition comparisons showed that several captive nonhuman primate (NHP) guts were more similar to the guts of humans with a non-westernized diet than humans with a westernized diet. Chronic diarrhea RM gut microbiome was strikingly similar to rural-living humans with diarrhea and humans with a non-westernized diet than asymptomatic RMs.

Our results suggested chronic diarrhea significantly altered the composition and metabolic pathways of the RM gut microbiome. The frequent use of antibiotics caused antibiotic resistance in chronic diarrhea RM gut microbiome with serious consequences for individual treatment and survival. The findings of this study will help us to improve the effective prevention and treatment of diarrhea in RMs.

Chronic diarrhea is a common disease of captive rhesus macaques (RMs, Macaca mulatta) [1, 2]. Chronic diarrhea in RMs is often manifested by chronic inflammatory response of the colon, and long-term and recurrent diarrhea, yet there has been no specific pathogen identified and antibiotics treatment is frequently ineffective [3]. Chronic diarrhea in RMs can cause dehydration, malnutrition, growth retardation, weight loss, weak immune response, and even death, resulting in great losses of captive RM breeding potential [2, 4]. This diarrheal disease of humans is also one of the most widespread diseases across the world, which threatens human health and is a particular threat for children who experience higher morbidity and mortality [5–7]. Compared to developed countries, the incidence rate of diarrhea is higher in developing countries due to poor hygiene and sanitation [7, 8]. However, the etiology of about half of human diarrheal cases cannot be clearly defined [9, 10].

Consequently, in this study, we used fecal metagenomes to comprehensively characterize gut microbial compositions and metabolic pathways of chronic diarrhea RMs, to quantify the resistome of RM gut microbiome, and to compare the gut microbial compositions between NHPs and humans. Our results indicated that Lactobacillus was considerably reduced in the gut of chronic diarrhea RMs. There was enrichment of aerobactin biosynthesis by Escherichia coli and reduced production of SCFAs in the gut microbiome of chronic diarrhea RMs. We found significant antibiotic resistance in the gut of chronic diarrhea RMs, including more abundant antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and higher resistance rates to antibiotics. Our results also showed that the gut microbiome of NHPs was more similar to humans with a non-westernized diet. These results can enhance understanding of the RM gut microbiome and antibiotic resistome to improve the diagnosis and therapy of chronic diarrhea.

The captive RMs in this study were from a breeding base in Meishan City of Sichuan Province, China. Although some RMs initially appeared mildly diarrheal symptoms, the diarrheal symptoms of most RMs disappeared after the first treatment of antibiotics. However, some RMs were still repeatedly diarrheal after repeated treatment with antibiotics and then developed chronic diarrhea. These chronic diarrhea RMs were characterized by long-term and recurrent diarrhea and no response to antibiotic treatment.

In this study, we collected 11 fresh feces of chronic diarrhea RMs and 18 fresh feces of asymptomatic RMs (control). All asymptomatic RMs and chronic diarrhea RMs lived in a similar environment and received the same diet. The chronic diarrhea RMs had been frequently treated using antibiotics including levofloxacin, metronidazole, gentamycin, cephalosporin, and florfenicol. Neither the asymptomatic nor the chronic diarrhea RMs had received antibiotic treatment for 30 days prior to sample collection. These fresh feces were collected using sterile instruments and then stored in sterile sampling tubes with ice packs to transfer to the laboratory. All samples used for shotgun metagenomic sequencing were finally stored at – 80 °C until processing. No RMs were hurt during the collection of feces, and our research had no impact on the health and welfare of RMs. The studied RMs continued their captive existence after the completion of our sample collection. Information of all studied RMs is summarized in Table S1.

The total DNA of RM feces was extracted using Tiangen DNA Stool Mini Kit (TIANGEN Biotech Co., Ltd. China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The extracted DNA was quantified by the NanoDrop. DNA samples with concentration > 10 ng/μl and A260/A280 > 1.6 were used for library preparation. The concentration of the final library was > 5 ng/μl in a volume of 50 μl. After we completed Illumina sequencing (Novogene Co., Ltd. China), adapters and low-quality reads in raw data were removed by Trimmomatic [37] and RM’s potential sequences were removed by Bowtie2 [38] based on the RM reference genome (assembly Mmul_10).

The assembly of the metagenome was performed using MEGAHIT [39] with the option “--min-contig-len 300.” The gene was predicted using Prodigal [40] with the option “-p meta.” The non-redundant gene set was constructed using CD-HIT [41] with the option “-c 0.95 -aS 0.90.” The non-redundant genes were further translated into amino acid sequences. These amino acid sequences were aligned using DIAMOND [42] to the Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database [43]. The amino acid sequences were also aligned to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database using KAAS [44] using the default parameter and the UniProt database [45] using DIAMOND to predict function. The quantification of these non-redundant genes in each metagenome was performed using Salmon [46] with the option “--meta.” The total abundance of each gene type consisted of the total abundance of all genes mapped to the same gene type. The abundances of gene families and microbial metabolic pathways were assessed using HUMAnN2 [47] based on the ChocoPhlAn database and UniRef90 EC filtered database [48] and were normalized by CPM (count per million).

The taxonomic labels of metagenomic sequences were assigned using kraken2 [49] with the option “--use-mpa-style.” The abundances of taxa were normalized by relative abundance. Differences in abundances of taxa, functional genes, and metabolic pathways were identified using LEfSe [50]. PCoA significance testing was performed using adonis. Differential abundance was detected using Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test with p < 0.05. Adonis significance testing and Bray-Curtis distances were analyzed using the vegan package of R.

To quantify the abundance of ARGs in gut microbiome, ARGs were quantified using ShortBRED [51]. The shortbred_identify.py script of ShortBRED produced a FASTA file of markers, using ARG sets from the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database (CARD) [52] as proteins of interest and UniRef90 sequences as reference proteins. The shortbred_quantify.py script of ShortBRED quantified the abundance of ARGs in metagenomes. The network between abundances of ARGs and gut microbiome was drawn using Cytoscape [53].

We isolated the bacteria from feces and tissue fluid, analyzing their resistant phenotype to confirm the antibiotic resistance of the gut microbiome. The suspension liquid of fresh feces of asymptomatic and chronic diarrhea RMs and suspension liquid of tissue fluid of a dead diarrheal RM were cultured on MacConkey agar medium at 37 °C for 24 h. The bacterial colonies were selected and further cultured on tryptic soy agar (TSA) medium at 37 °C for 24 h. These isolates were identified by the 16S rRNA gene. All isolates were tested for resistant phenotypes to 12 antibiotics using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion. The 12 antibiotics were cefotaxime (CTX), gentamycin (CN), florfenicol (FFC), tetracycline (TE), kanamycin (K), imipenem (IPM), ciprofloxacin (CIP), cefazolin (KZ), ofloxacin (OFX), cefoxitin (FOX), streptomycin (S), and ampicillin (AMP). The antibiotic susceptibility of isolates was interpreted by Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (CLSI) (M100-S30). The Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 served as a quality control strain.

We analyzed the fecal metagenomes of humans and five species of NHPs to compare the gut microbiome of NHPs and humans. We downloaded the fecal metagenomes of captive Macaca fascicularis (n = 20) [54], Pan troglodytes (n = 18), Gorilla gorilla gorilla (n = 15) [55] and 80 healthy humans (41 individuals with a non-westernized diet and 39 with a westernized diet [56–62]) from public databases. NHPs samples were supplemented by six fecal metagenomes of captive or semi-captive Macaca thibetana that had been sequenced in our previous study. We also downloaded 67 fecal metagenomes of humans with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), encompassing 46 samples with Crohn’s disease (CD, a type of IBD) and 21 samples with ulcerative colitis (UC, a type of IBD) [63]. We then downloaded 11 fecal metagenomes from humans living rurally with acute diarrhea and 37 fecal metagenomes from urban humans with acute diarrhea from public databases [64]. These metagenomes were filtered using Trimmomatic and Bowtie2 to remove low-quality reads and hosts’ sequences. The taxonomic labels of these metagenomic sequences were assigned using kraken2. The abundances of taxa were normalized by relative abundance.

We compared the gut microbiomes of asymptomatic RMs and chronic diarrhea RMs to characterize differences in gut microbial composition. There were seven dominant phyla whose relative abundances were more than 1% in at least one sample, namely Firmicutes (17.9–87.0%), Bacteroidetes (3.1–36.0%), Proteobacteria (2.8–76.2%), Actinobacteria (1.2–24.9%), Spirochaetes (0.1–12.8%), Verrucomicrobia (0.03–15.65%) and Tenericutes (0.08–1.91%) (Fig. S1a). The relative abundances of Firmicutes and Spirochaetes in the guts of asymptomatic RMs were significantly greater than in chronic diarrhea RMs (Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test, p < 0.01). The relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria in the guts of chronic diarrhea RMs were significantly greater than asymptomatic RMs (Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test, p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively) (Fig. S1b and c).

Due to mucin degradation likely leading to diarrhea, we also compared the relative abundance of mucin-degrading bacteria [65] in the guts of RMs. The relative abundances of these mucin-degrading bacteria including Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breve, and Ruminococcus gnavus in the guts of chronic diarrhea RMs were significantly greater than in asymptomatic RM guts (Fig. S1h).

Due to the greater abundance of Lactobacillus in asymptomatic RM guts, the potential contigs of Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus amylovorus were screened out and annotated. Lactobacillus johnsonii harbored probiotic genes encoding lactate dehydrogenases, mucus-binding proteins (MUB), bile salt hydrolase (BSH), and bile salt transporter (BST). Similarly, these genes encoding lactate dehydrogenases, bacteriocin, bacteriocin ABC transporter, MUB, and BSH were identified in contigs of Lactobacillus reuteri. The genes encoding lactate dehydrogenases, MUB, and bacteriocin were also identified in contigs of Lactobacillus amylovorus.

Due to the high abundance of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism in the guts of RMs, we predicted carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) of the gut microbiome based on the CAZy database to further understand the activity of CAZymes of the gut microbiome. These CAZymes were identified from six classes of enzymes, namely glycoside hydrolase (GH), glycosyltransferase (GT), carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), carbohydrate esterase (CE), polysaccharide lyase (PL), and auxiliary activity (AA). Total genes of CAZymes in the asymptomatic RM gut microbiome were significantly more abundant than in chronic diarrhea RM gut microbiome (Fig.
2d). Notably, the genes encoding CBMs, GHs, and PLs were significantly more abundant in the gut microbiome of asymptomatic RMs (Fig.
2e). We found that GH13 was the most prevalent GH family in the guts of asymptomatic and chronic diarrhea RMs (Fig.
2f and Fig. S2b). However, a relative abundance of GH13 was significantly greater in the asymptomatic RM gut microbiome than in the chronic diarrheal RM gut microbiome. Additionally, most GH families, such as GH1, GH43, GH3, GH23, and GH25, were significantly more abundant in the asymptomatic RM gut microbiome.

We compared the gut microbial composition of asymptomatic RMs, captive Macaca thibetana, captive M. fascicularis, captive Pan troglodytes, captive Gorilla gorilla, humans with a non-westernized diet, and humans with a westernized diet. Lactobacillus was prevalent in the guts of all NHPs but was scarce in the guts of humans (Fig.
3a and Fig. S3a). The PCoA plot based on Bray-Curtis distance of genus-level relative abundance profiles exhibited that almost all samples of NHPs (particularly M. fascicularis, P. troglodytes, and G. gorilla gorilla) were spatially close to the samples of humans with a non-westernized diet (Fig.
3b). Differences in Bray-Curtis distances showed that the gut microbiome of captive P. troglodytes were more similar to both humans with a non-westernized diet and a westernized diet (Fig. S3b). Meanwhile, the gut microbiome of each captive NHP was more similar to humans with a non-westernized diet than humans with a westernized diet (Fig.
3c).

We then compared the gut microbiomes of asymptomatic RMs, chronic diarrhea RMs, humans with IBD (i.e., CD and UC, with a westernized diet), acute diarrheal humans (from rural and urban populations), and healthy humans (i.e., non-westernized and westernized diet). The PCoA plot based on Bray-Curtis distances of genus-level relative abundance profiles indicated that these samples of humans were largely clustered by diet rather than disease (Fig.
3d). Furthermore, the samples of rural acute diarrhea humans and urban acute diarrhea humans were distant in the PCoA plot. The samples of chronic diarrhea RMs were closer to the samples of rural diarrhea humans and humans with a non-westernized diet (Fig.
3d and Fig. S3c).

The ARGs in the RM gut microbiome were identified and quantified using ShortBRED based on created unique markers. The total abundance of ARGs (measured by RPKM) in chronic diarrhea RM guts were significantly greater than in asymptomatic RM guts based on Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test (p = 0.00019) (Fig.
4a). The PCoA plot based on ARGs abundance showed that almost all of the samples of asymptomatic RMs and chronic diarrhea RMs were spatially separated (Fig.
4b). The tetQ gene encoding tetracycline antibiotic resistance was most prevalent in the gut microbiomes of asymptomatic RMs and chronic diarrhea RMs (Fig.
4c and Fig. S4a). The tetO and tet(40) encoding tetracycline antibiotic resistance; ermF, ermB, and mel encoding macrolide antibiotic resistance; aph(3’)-IIIa, aph(2”)-If, aac(6’)-Ib7, and aad(6) encoding aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance; OXA-347 encoding β-lactam antibiotic resistance; floR encoding phenicol antibiotic resistance; sul1 encoding sulfonamide antibiotic resistance; and SAT-4 encoding nucleoside antibiotic resistance were significantly more abundant in the gut microbiome of chronic diarrhea RMs than asymptomatic RMs. These main classes of ARGs were tetracycline, lincosamide/macrolide/streptogramin antibiotics, aminoglycoside antibiotics, cephamycin, and phenicol antibiotics in the gut microbiome of RMs (Fig.
4d).

To further verify antibiotic resistance, we tested resistant phenotypes of isolates from feces and tissue fluid of captive RMs. A total of 31 Escherichia coli isolates, 29 Klebsiella pneumonia isolates, 16 Proteus mirabilis isolates, 2 Klebsiella aerogenes isolates, and 2 Klebsiella quasipneumoniae isolates were isolated from feces of chronic diarrhea RMs, feces of asymptomatic RMs, and tissue fluid of a dead diarrheal RM (Table S2). Almost all of the isolates from feces and tissue fluid of chronic diarrhea RMs were resistant to FFC (49/51), TE (48/49), K (48/51), CIP (55/58), KZ (54/58), OFX (55/58), and AMP (57/58) (Fig.
4e). However, the majority of these isolates were susceptible to IPM (57/58) and FOX (54/58). The isolates from feces of asymptomatic RMs had the highest resistance rate to AMP (16/22), followed by TE (12/18) and S (10/22). Similarly, almost all of these isolates were susceptible to IPM (22/22) and FOX (21/22).

In this study, we observed a distinct difference between the gut microbiome of chronic diarrhea RMs compared to asymptomatic individuals. Age and gender did not significantly influence the gut microbiome of these captive RMs, which had the same diet and similar living environment. Therefore, the gut microbial composition of these RMs was significantly influenced by diarrheal disease rather than age or gender. Here, we revealed the significant differences in the composition, metabolic pathways, and resistome of the gut microbiome between chronic diarrhea RMs and asymptomatic individuals.

The testing of resistant phenotypes of isolates further demonstrated serious antibiotic resistance of chronic diarrhea RMs gut microbiome. Not only was there a high abundance of ARG in the gut microbiome of chronic diarrhea RMs, but these RM guts also had high antibiotic resistance rates within isolates. These isolates from chronic diarrhea RMs generally had higher antibiotic resistance rates to florfenicol, tetracycline, aminoglycoside, quinolone, and cephalosporin antibiotics according to our susceptibility testing. Most of these antibiotics were used in previous treatments of diarrhea. Therefore, a directed use of antibiotics in the treatment of diarrheal RMs is necessary to avoid more serious antibiotic resistance. It is worth noting that almost all isolates were susceptible to imipenem and cefoxitin. Due to a stronger stabilization compared to other cephalosporins, bacteria usually had low resistance rates to cefoxitin (a type of cephamycin antibiotics) and imipenem (a type of carbapenem antibiotics) [107, 108]. Therefore, cephamycin and carbapenem antibiotics may be effective to treat diarrhea in RMs and provide new treatment protocols. Nonetheless, the use of cephamycin and carbapenem antibiotics still needs to be treated with caution to avoid novel antibiotic resistance. It is also necessary to monitor resistance phenotype(s) of common antibiotic resistance bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, in RM guts and the captive environment. These measures could effectively decrease the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance in captive RMs.

In conclusion, our results indicated that individuals with chronic diarrhea had significantly different gut microbiomes compared with asymptomatic individuals. We also identified that frequent use of antibiotics caused antibiotic resistance in RM guts, with serious consequences for the treatment of chronic diarrhea. According to our results, beneficial strains of Lactobacillus from RM guts could be regarded as a potential probiotic to prevent or relieve RM diarrhea in future research and treatment. It was necessary to monitor antibiotic resistance of bacteria in RMs’ environments to reduce the propagative risks from ARGs and multidrug-resistant bacteria. Our results also revealed a greater similarity in gut microbial compositions between captive NHPs including RMs and humans with a non-westernized diet. This result suggests that diarrheal RM could be considered a suitable model to research diarrhea in humans with a non-westernized diet. Overall, our results provided a clearer understanding of the gut microbiome and antibiotic resistome of chronic diarrhea RMs.
