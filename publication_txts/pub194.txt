The gut of the finch: uniqueness of the gut microbiome of the Galápagos vampire finch



Darwin’s finches are a clade of 19 species of passerine birds native to the Galápagos Islands, whose biogeography, specialized beak morphologies, and dietary choices—ranging from seeds to blood—make them a classic example of adaptive radiation. While these iconic birds have been intensely studied, the composition of their gut microbiome and the factors influencing it, including host species, diet, and biogeography, has not yet been explored.

We characterized the microbial community associated with 12 species of Darwin’s finches using high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples from 114 individuals across nine islands, including the unusual blood-feeding vampire finch (Geospiza septentrionalis) from Darwin and Wolf Islands. The phylum-level core gut microbiome for Darwin’s finches included the Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, with members of the Bacteroidetes at conspicuously low abundance. The gut microbiome was surprisingly well conserved across the diversity of finch species, with one exception—the vampire finch—which harbored bacteria that were either absent or extremely rare in other finches, including Fusobacterium, Cetobacterium, Ureaplasma, Mucispirillum, Campylobacter, and various members of the Clostridia—bacteria known from the guts of carnivorous birds and reptiles. Complementary stable isotope analysis of feathers revealed exceptionally high δ15N isotope values in the vampire finch, resembling top marine predators. The Galápagos archipelago is also known for extreme wet and dry seasons, and we observed a significant seasonal shift in the gut microbial community of five additional finch species sampled during both seasons.

This study demonstrates the overall conservatism of the finch gut microbiome over short (< 1 Ma) divergence timescales, except in the most extreme case of dietary specialization, and elevates the evolutionary importance of seasonal shifts in driving not only species adaptation, but also gut microbiome composition.

First introduced to science by Charles Darwin in his diaries from the voyage of the HMS Beagle [1], Darwin’s finches are a classic example of adaptive radiation, the phenomenon by which species diverge from a common ancestor as they adapt to different ecological niches. Divergence of Darwin’s finches from relatives in South America has taken place in the last ~ 1.5 My, when ancestral finches first colonized the islands [2]. Since this time, 19 formally recognized finch species have evolved within this clade—18 in the Galápagos and 1 in the Cocos Islands [3, 4], with major radiations occurring in the last 300 ka [5, 6].

Here, we analyzed the gut microbiota of 12 species of Darwin’s finches, sampled across 9 of the 18 Galápagos Islands during both the wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, from January to early June, food is abundant, while food becomes limiting and the birds resort to their “adaptive” diet in the dry season, from July to December [10]. Fecal samples were collected from 114 individual finches, including the two remote populations of vampire finch (Geospiza septentrionalis) on Darwin and Wolf Islands. Microbial diversity was screened using Illumina high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. A complementary analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of feathers from vampire finches and a subset of others was also performed as an independent means to identify dietary signatures. The diversity in diet and lifestyle of Darwin’s finches and the extensive ecological and genetic knowledge of this avian group make them an attractive study subject to examine how host diet, biogeography, phylogeny, and other environmental factors affect the vertebrate gut microbial community over relatively short evolutionary timescales.

The 16S rRNA gene diversity of the gut microbiome of Darwin’s finches was characterized from fecal samples collected from 114 finches, representing 12 of 19 species distributed across nine of the Galápagos Islands (Fig. 1; Table 1; note that as a singleton, sequence data from the one specimen of C. pallida was removed from subsequent analysis). This dataset yielded an average of 25,382 16S rRNA sequences per finch and collectively comprised 297 unique bacterial ribotypes (OTUs; 97% similarity level), present above a minimum threshold set at 1% relative abundance in at least one finch in the dataset. These OTUs primarily grouped within three major bacterial phyla: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria (Fig. 2; Additional file 1: Table S1). The number of OTUs recovered from each species was 71.6 ± 9.8 (avg ± SD; Additional file 2: Table S2). Shannon diversity indices for the Galápagos finch microbiome dataset ranged between 1.4 and 2.2 per finch species (Additional file 2: Table S2), within the range of diversity indices from other avian species (0.6–3.4) [26].

Representatives from the Bacteroidetes and five additional phyla (Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Deferribacteres, Fusobacteria, and Tenericutes) were detected, but occurred in only a subset of the finches (typically at < 1% average abundance; Fig. 2; Additional file 1: Table S1). While polysaccharide-degrading Bacteroidetes represent a significant component of the gut microbiome in many vertebrates [16, 38, 41, 42], they were rare, or not detected, in Darwins’ finches (< 0.5% on average in 23/113 finches, and absent in 88 finches), with the exception of 2 finch individuals (C. parvulus, San Cristóbal, wet season and G. conirostris, Genovesa, dry season; Bacteroidetes at 12% and 26%, respectively). Decreased Bacteroidetes presence has been previously observed in birds; however, the previously reported relative abundance of 3–20% is comparably higher than the vast majority of the finches analyzed in this study [20, 39, 40]. Even finches specializing in a carbohydrate-rich diet (e.g., the vegetarian and cactus finches, P. crassirostris and G. scandens) did not show a positive relationship with this bacterial phylum, with only one P. crassirostris and one G. scandens harboring Bacteroidetes OTUs, < 0.02% total microbiota. It is currently unknown which bacterial lineages may occupy a similar niche as Bacteroidetes in the finch microbiome.

Perhaps the most extreme nutritional strategy among Darwin’s finches is that of the vampire finch, Geospiza septentrionalis, endemic to the remote northernmost islands of Darwin and Wolf. During the dry season on the Galápagos Islands, when samples for this study were collected, vampire finches feed primarily on the blood and eggs of boobies (Sula spp.; Fig. 1, inset), as well as partially digested fish regurgitate and guano (D. Baldassarre, personal observation, see Additional file 4 for information on finch feeding behavior). By contrast, finches on other islands consume plant-based foods and insects throughout the year [10, 15]. Indeed, the stable isotope values of feathers collected from vampire finches during the dry season were notably enriched in nitrogen-15, with δ15N values between + 14.2 and + 25.1‰, significantly different from the two ground finch species, G. fortis and G. fuliginosa, δ15N = + 4.9 and + 11.7‰, respectively; ANOVA p < 0.0001; Fig. 3a. The positively shifted δ15N values of the vampire finches are more similar to marine carnivores, including sea lions and polar bears, than to other avian species [43–45]. The distinct δ15N values for G. septentrionalis, consistent with a high trophic-level marine-feeding animal, are likely the outcome of the consumption of proteins sourced predominantly from Nazca boobies, which eat fish. Alternatively, a trend towards positive nitrogen stable isotope ratios has also been shown to occur under starvation conditions, associated with the breakdown of muscle proteins [46]. Given the extreme conditions during the dry season on Darwin and Wolf Islands, this cannot be ruled out as a contributing factor; however, the vampire finches collected in this study had consistently high keel fat content and weights between the wet and dry seasons (J. Chaves, personal observation), suggesting that their distinct isotopic composition is not likely due to nutritional deprivation.

Additionally, finch phylogeny appeared insignificant for the deepest-sampled non-vampire finches (G. fuliginosa and G. fortis, n = 11 each; ANOSIM R = 0, p = 0.48), suggesting that host phylogeny is not likely a major influence on the gut microbiome of Darwin’s finches. Additional sampling from more distantly related and under-sampled species is necessary to thoroughly clarify the role of phylogeny. Nevertheless, of these potential variables examined, a blood-feeding diet of Geospiza septentrionalis, independently supported by isotopic evidence, appears to be the significant contributor to the unique diversity of the gut microbiome.

Investigations of Darwin’s finches provided a unique opportunity to compare the influence of extreme seasonal shifts on the gut microbiome. The Galápagos Islands are well known for strong seasonal cycles driving the availability of vegetation and other food sources utilized by Darwin’s finches, and it is during the dry season that natural selection for unique feeding adaptations is most intense [3, 55]. It is thought that food limitation during the dry season induces specialization and speciation of the various finch species, as species adapt to recalcitrant resources such as Tribulus seeds, a process documented in Darwin’s ground finches especially during extreme El Niño events [3, 10]. Plant growth and seed production occurs during the wet season (January to June), which is also associated with an increase in arthropod abundance [7]. During the dry season, however, finches undergo significant dietary stress as plant-based food sources become limiting [55] and it is then that speciation becomes observable [3]. Season has been identified as a significant driver of gut microbiome divergence in other animals, including alligators, which engage in protracted fasting during the winter [48]. Whether the microbiome of Darwin’s finches responds to seasonal extremes on the Galápagos Islands is an outstanding question.

A preliminary assessment of diet specialization in a limited number of these finches (broadly categorized as granivory, omnivory, insectivory, nectarivory, and herbivory) revealed no obvious relationship with the gut microbiome, despite well-documented shifts in finch beak morphology and behavior. Other bird species have shown similar patterns, where only the most extreme diets (e.g., vultures, and other scavengers) resulted in a marked difference in the microbiome [20]. Most of Darwin’s finch species have remained omnivorous, with an emphasis on seeds; thus, the influence of diet specialization on the gut microbiome in these species is expected to be minor compared to other animal groups where more extreme dietary specialization has led to shifts in composition (e.g., phyllostomid bats [21, 22] and cichlid fishes [31]). Additional sampling—particularly of the seed-specializing ground finches, G. fuliginosa, G. fortis, and G. magnirostris, which are distributed across multiple islands, as well as dietary specialists such as the vegetarian P. crassirostris and insectivorous Ce. olivacea—may reveal more subtle trends driving gut microbiome composition.

Darwin’s finches have long been recognized as a model system for investigating interactions between biogeography, dietary specialization, morphology, and other aspects of evolutionary radiation. To this list can now be added the interaction of these factors with the composition of the gut microbial community. The radiation of Darwin’s finches has occurred relatively rapidly and recently (~ 300 ka). During this time, it appears that the gut microbial composition of most finch species has remained conserved among the majority of species examined in this study. A conspicuous exception to this conservation occurs in the case of the vampire finch, Geospiza septentrionalis, with a microbial community significantly distinct from the other finches. Because of the barrenness of Darwin and Wolf Islands, the vampire finches undergo extreme dietary limitations during the dry season, thus leading to blood feeding [15]. Their unique and carnivore-like diet likely contributes to the distinct gut microbial composition, suggesting that cases of extreme dietary divergence can overpower phylogenetic inertia to drive shifts in microbiome composition, even over short evolutionary timescales. Future studies in other recent avian radiations that include dietary extremes, such as the blood-feeding Galápagos Hood mockingbird (Mimus macdonaldi), should help with investigating this hypothesis.

A robust seasonal difference was observed between finches collected during the wet and dry seasons and may reflect temporal shifts in response to changes in food resource availability, weather, mating or nesting, or other factors. Further sampling—particularly resampling individual finches through time, across seasons—may help to resolve these uncertainties. It will be interesting to see whether the trends observed in this year-long wet-to-dry cycle is reflected in longer term datasets or with more extreme weather periods experienced, for example, during El Niño/La Niña conditions. This goal will be challenging given their remote nature, enhanced diversity, and numerous overlapping influences. Regardless, Darwin’s finches continue to capture our attention and reveal new secrets after more than a century and a half of study.

Individuals (n = 114) from 12 species of Darwin’s finches, from nine islands over both the wet and dry seasons, were captured in mist nets and their fecal material sampled (Table 1, Fig. 1). Dry season samples were collected during November–December 2015, while wet season samples were collected between March and June 2016. Fecal samples were collected by placing the bird in a paper bag on top of a metal mesh grate above a sterilized weigh boat for 3-5 min [58]. Samples were immediately transferred into ~ 2 ml of LifeGuard Preservation Solution (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Feather samples from three species (G. fortis, G. fuliginosa, and G. septentrionalis) were collected for isotopic analysis in Jan 2016 (Fig. 3a).

Prior to extracting DNA, samples were centrifuged to remove the LifeGuard preservation solution. Genomic DNA was then recovered from the pelleted fecal material using a PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions, with the exception of the addition of a bead-beating step using a Fast Prep 120 instrument; Thermo Electron Corporation). The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was PCR-amplified from each extract using the archaeal and bacterial targeted primer set 515F and 806R [59], following the protocol outlined by Case et al. [60]. Successful PCR amplifications were pooled, in duplicate, and barcodes were added according to the Earth Microbiome Project protocol [59, 61, 62]; 5 μl of the amplicon product from the first PCR was used as template in a 5-cycle, 25-μl reconditioning reaction with the same EMP-recommended conditions and the full EMP primers. Samples were mixed together in equimolar amounts and purified in bulk through a Qiagen PCR Purification kit. At all PCR steps, amplification success and purity was checked by gel electrophoresis. Paired-end sequences (2x 250 basepair) were generated from barcoded amplicon products at Laragen, Inc. on an Illumina MiSeq platform. At Laragen, the raw data was passed through a filter which demultiplexed the library into individual samples and removed any sequences which had > 1 basepair mismatch on the 12-basepair barcode sequence, and assigned quality scores to each basepair call on every sequence. At the same time, adapter, barcode, and primer sequences were removed. Raw reads were deposited and are available through the Sequence Read Archive under accession number SRP130314.

The contribution of individual OTUs to statistically significant grouping by factor was queried using similarity percentage (SIMPER), and the significance of differential abundance in individual OTUs by factor grouping were statistically tested using two-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests. In an approach similar to beta diversity tests, for data subdivisions where random sub-setting was necessary to achieve equal sample sizes within each factor category, Mann-Whitney tests were run over 100 random subsets of the larger category size, and the average p value was reported. Summary statistics and plots were generated in R using the packages “phyloseq,” “vegan,” “ggplot2,” and “RColorBrewer” [70–74].

The isotopic signature of an organism—including that of δ13C, δ15N, and δ34S of proteins in animal tissues such as hair or feathers—is primarily influenced by food source and is frequently used to discern differences in diet (e.g., [75]). Feathers were collected from a subset of finch species during the transition between dry and wet seasons (Jan 2016). Prior to isotopic analysis, feathers were immersed in 2:1 dichloro-methane:methanol to remove surface oils as described by Blight et al. [76]. After air-drying, feather length and weight were recorded and then individual feathers were split along the rachis and transferred to tin capsules (0.3–1.0 mg), for parallel carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur isotope analysis. Feather δ13C and δ15N and weight percent C and N (wt.% TOC and TON) were determined via continuous flow (He; 100 ml/min) on a Costech Instruments Elemental Combustion System model 4010 by oxidation at 980 °C over chromium (III) oxide and silvered cobalt (II, III) oxide followed by reduction over elemental copper at 650 °C. CO2 was subsequently passed through a water trap and then a 5-Å molecular sieve GC column at 50 °C to separate N2 from CO2, which was diluted with helium in a Conflo IV interface/open split prior to analysis. Fast jump was calibrated and applied to measure both CO2 and N2 in the same run. δ13C and δ15N values were measured on a Thermo Scientific Delta V Plus irMS. δ13C and δ15N values were corrected for sample size dependency and then normalized to the VPDB scale with a two-point calibration [77]. Error was determined by analyzing sucrose (NIST 8542), acetanilide (Costech Analytical Technologies Inc.), and nitrate (IAEA-NO-3) in combination with in-house standards (from − 45.93‰ to − 10.45‰ for C and − 3.02‰ to 4.70‰ for N). For C measurements, accuracy was ± 0.18‰ (n = 50) and precision was ± 0.23‰ (n = 50; 1σ). For N measurements, accuracy was ± 0.22‰ (n = 36) and precision was ± 0.43‰ (n = 36; 1σ). Feather δ34S and weight percent S (wt.% TOS) was measured using continuous flow (He; 120 ml/min) on a ThermoQuest NC2500 mass spectrometer (ThermoQuest Italia, Milan, Italy) by oxidation at 1000 °C over tungsten (VI) oxide and elemental copper. SO2 was subsequently passed through a water trap and then a 5-Å molecular sieve GC column at 85 °C. A Conflo III interface/open split was used to introduce SO2 to a Thermo Scientific Delta plus XL irMS. The δ34S values were corrected for sample size dependency and the normalized to the VCDT scale with a two-point calibration. Error was determined by analyzing two silver sulfides (IAEA-S-2 and IAEA-S-3) in combination with in-house standards including pyrite and sulfanilamide. Accuracy on the δ34S measurement was ± 1.84‰ (n = 20) and precision was ± 0.35‰ (n = 20; 1σ).
