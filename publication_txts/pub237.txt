An in vitro model maintaining taxon-specific functional activities of the gut microbiome

In vitro gut microbiome models could provide timely and cost-efficient solutions to study microbiome responses to drugs. For this purpose, in vitro models that maintain the functional and compositional profiles of in vivo gut microbiomes would be extremely valuable. Here, we present a 96-deep well plate-based culturing model (MiPro) that maintains the functional and compositional profiles of individual gut microbiomes, as assessed by metaproteomics, while allowing a four-fold increase in viable bacteria counts. Comparison of taxon-specific functions between pre- and post-culture microbiomes shows a Pearson’s correlation coefficient r of 0.83 ± 0.03. In addition, we show a high degree of correlation between gut microbiome responses to metformin in the MiPro model and those in mice fed a high-fat diet. We propose MiPro as an in vitro gut microbiome model for scalable investigation of drug-microbiome interactions such as during high-throughput drug screening.

The gut microbiota is being increasingly recognized as a key factor in human health and disease1, and as such, it is an important target for drug therapy2. Evidence is mounting that microbial metabolism of drugs can directly affect drug efficacy and toxicity3,4, and that drugs can, in turn, alter the composition and function of the gut microbiota5–9, potentially affecting the health of the host. Therefore, the gut microbial ecosystem, specific microbes, and microbial pathways are novel targets in drug discovery.

Here, we report the development and validation of a scalable in vitro model for the maintenance of gut microbiome profiles (MiPro). Briefly, the MiPro model adopted an optimized culture medium and a 96-deep well plate-based format for microbiome culture (Fig.
1a). The culture medium and culturing conditions were improved from our previous medium composition study22. The model was first evaluated for its ability to maintain gut microbiome profiles in vitro, followed by testing and evaluation of the model’s in vitro correlation with in vivo drug response. This culture model enabled, in combination with metaproteomic analysis, the assessment of drug effects on the microbiome at compositional and functional levels. This model maintained high microbiome compositional stability and greater than 0.83 taxon-function similarity (Pearson’s r) over 24 h. In addition, we demonstrated that our MiPro model recapitulated the in vivo effects of metformin observed on individual mouse gut microbiomes.

The first objective of this work was to develop a scalable in vitro model for the maintenance of gut microbiome profiles. We have recently evaluated the composition of the culture medium for optimal culturing of ex vivo microbiomes22. Here, we improved upon the composition of our previously reported medium by assessing the effect of bile salts formulae on the gut microbiome. Two formulae were compared: (1) a mixture of primary bile salts, i.e. 1:1 (w/w) sodium salt forms of cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and (2) a commercial 1:1 (w/w) mixture of sodium salt forms of CA and deoxycholic acid (DCA). The commercial bile salts mixture has been adopted by a majority of studies employing gut microbiome culture media11,12,30–36. We compared the maintenance of taxon-specific functional profiles for gut microbiota cultured in the presence of either formulae (Fig.
1b). Briefly, gut microbiota cultured for 24 h were subjected to metaproteomic analysis, and a taxon-function-coupled analysis was carried out using the iMetaLab platform (http://shiny.imetalab.ca/, Supplementary Fig. 1). We observed significant increase of Pearson’s correlation coefficient r of taxon-specific functional profiles between the inocula (0 h baseline sample) and the cultured microbiome in the presence of the primary bile salts mixture (CDCA + CA). Moreover, comparison of microbiome composition (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b) and the abundances of clusters of orthologous group (COG) categories (Supplementary Fig. 2C) also suggested that the presence of CDCA + CA could maintain the microbiome better than DCA + CA.

Additionally, we assessed whether the gut microbiome culture was affected by the culturing conditions, namely (1) tube-based and (2) 96-deep well based culturing, while keeping all other conditions, including medium, inoculum, temperature, and container material (polypropylene) constant. Culture tubes are the most frequently used containers in batch culture experiments11,22,36. Notably, the 96-deep well was covered with a silicone-gel cover, which was perforated at the top of each well. This cover could impair gas-exchange with the outer environment in the chamber, so as to preserve the partial pressure of gases and volatile metabolites in each well, which could subsequently preserve certain levels of dissolved gas molecules in the culture medium. In contrast to the use of 96-deep well plates, employing culture tubes resulted in a remarkable change in the taxon-specific functional activity (Fig.
1b) as well as other taxonomic and functional profiles (Supplementary Fig. 2). From the above results, we established our MiPro model (Fig.
1a): a 96-deep well plate-based culturing in combination with the optimized medium which contains 1:1 (w/w) of CA and CDCA (hereafter called MiPro medium).

We next evaluated the ability of the MiPro model to sustain a viable microbiome, which is vital for an effective in vitro microbiome response study. Temporal changes in parameters including microbial biomass, cell count, viability and diversity were compared with the 0 h baseline sample. The commonly used basal culture medium (BCM) was included for comparison. Since different microbial members can differ by several orders of magnitude in biomass27, it is necessary to examine both biomass and bacterial counts. We used optical density at 595 nm (OD595) to determine bacterial biomass density, and used flow cytometry to determine bacterial cell counts. At 24 h the OD595 was 0.8 ± 0.1 fold higher (i.e., 80% higher) in the optimized medium as compared to that cultured in BCM (Fig.
1c). Furthermore, using flow cytometry in combination with viability staining, we found that our MiPro medium achieved high ratio of viable bacterial cells throughout the culture period (95.8% at 24 h compared with 71.2% at 0 h, Fig.
1d). Comparison of the flow cytometry readouts between the inoculum and the cultured microbiome showed a 4.4-fold increase of viable bacterial count in MiPro medium after 24 h of culturing, whereas a 3.0-fold increase was detected in the BCM medium at 9 h post-culturing and followed by a decline.

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of MiPro to simulate the in vivo features of the gut microbiome inoculum, we used a metaproteomic approach27,37 to characterize the taxonomic and functional stability of three individuals’ gut microbiomes over 9, 24, 34 and 48 h of growth in either MiPro or BCM media. A minimum of three cultured, technical replicates were analyzed at each time point by LC-MS/MS. Ninety high-quality MS raw files were obtained with a total of 2,066,069 MS/MS spectra. With an average MS/MS identification rate of 40.8% ± 4.5% (mean ± SD), a total of 58,848 peptides and 16,326 protein groups were identified with a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 1% (Supplementary Fig. 4a). A high concordance (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = 0.97 ± 0.02) was observed between the technical replicates of each group, indicating robust experimental reproducibility (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Using an LCA approach on the MetaLab37, a total of 21,839 peptides were assigned with a taxonomic lineage, resulting in 788 assigned species. The quantitative information (summed peptide intensities) was used to assess the species-level biomass contributions27,37. 121 species that were quantified with ≥3 peptides were included in the comparison of species biomass contributions.

We then investigated the maximal culture time that MiPro could achieve. Noting that there would be consumption of medium nutrients and accumulation of microbial metabolites over time that may affect microbiome functions, we replaced one quarter of the cultured suspension (i.e., 250 µl) with same volume of fresh medium every 12 h. Samples were analyzed by metaproteomics at 0 h baseline and at 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-days of growth. We quantified 32,030 peptides and 9307 protein groups from the fifteen samples with an average MS/MS identification rate of 51.2% ± 1.6% (mean ± SD). 29,882 peptides were assigned a taxonomic lineage, yielding 149 species that were quantified with ≥3 peptides. Taxon-function-coupled analysis showed that the Pearson’s correlation coefficient r of the taxon-specific functional profiles between the baseline and cultured microbiome were maintained well above 0.8 for 5 days of growth (Fig.
2f). The species-level biomass distribution also suggested that the microbiome was sustained throughout the 5-days of culture (Fig.
2g).

We then evaluated the in vitro–in vivo correlation (IVIVC) of microbiome drug response in the MiPro model using C57/BL6 mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Metformin is a widely prescribed drug for treating type 2 diabetes and it has been reported that in human 30% of the oral dose can be recovered in feces41. Several studies have shown that metformin alters gut microbiota composition and functions5,6,42. We, therefore, employed metformin to validate our MiPro model by comparing the impact of metformin exposure on gut microbial communities in mice and in our in vitro model. Briefly, the MiPro model was inoculated with the stool microbiome from each mouse and cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of metformin. Mice were treated daily for 28 days with 300 mg/kg of metformin through gavage, and stool samples were collected at days 0, 14 and 28. All samples were then analyzed using metaproteomics. Thirty-four MS raw files were obtained with 926,004 MS/MS spectra. With an average MS/MS identification rate of 23.5% ± 12.9% (mean ± SD), 51,294 peptide sequences corresponding to 12,733 protein groups were identified with an FDR threshold of 1%. 11,870 peptides were assigned a taxonomic lineage, along with 60 genera and 79 species quantified with ≥ 3 peptides.

For functional analysis, protein groups were first filtered with the criteria that the protein groups should be present in ≥50% in each of the listed subgroups (including in vitro untreated versus in vitro 24 h treated, in vivo untreated versus in vivo day 14 or day 28 treated samples). PLS-DA was performed on shared proteins, and proteins with a VIP score >1 were regarded as differentially expressed protein groups, which were mainly involved in 12 KEGG pathways (Fig.
4a). A total of 11,222 (out of 17,646) proteins that correspond to these KEGG pathways were extracted from the original protein group file. All LFQ intensities of protein groups that were assigned to each of the 12 pathways were summed in each sample for a KEGG pathway-level evaluation. Figure
4a shows that the relative abundances of selected pathways were uniformly altered in both in vitro and in vivo metformin-treated samples in comparison to untreated microbiomes. Subsequently, IVIVC were visualized by comparing the changed value of these KEGG pathways (Fig.
4b). In most cases, changed proteins appeared in quadrants I and III (Fig. 4b), suggesting agreement between in vitro and in vivo responses. Among these, glycolysis/glucogenesis, ABC transporters and two-component system showed high levels of variation. Here we explored further the shift of functional balance by normalizing the intensities of each enzyme against the summed protein intensity of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway (Fig.
4c). In general, the proportions of enzymes were similar in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the in vitro model retained the functionality of the gut microbiome. Nine out of the 17 enzymes were significantly affected by metformin treatment in vivo; for the in vitro model, five significant changes were found. All other enzymes in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway showed similar trends in vitro versus in vivo, although they did not reach statistical significance.

The gut microbiome constitutes a complex microbial ecosystem in which each microbe may play a different functional role47. Environmental changes can trigger structural and functional alterations in the microbiome. Although some studies have shown that the gut bacterial community can be cultured in vitro10–12,48, these studies have not demonstrated the maintenance of the microbiota’s functional activities. While taxonomic profiling is important to characterize an individual’s microbiome, biological processes and functions cannot be assessed by compositional analyses. Yet, such information is essential for gaining deeper understanding of the microbiota’s behavior and functional activities and ultimately for designing microbiome-targeted manipulations. The need for functional understanding is even more crucial given that the microbiome’s functions can be altered in absence of compositional changes. For example, sialylated milk oligosaccharides elicit a microbiota-dependent growth in mice, which are used as models of infant undernutrition by inducing the production of microbial metabolites, yet without any significant change in the relative abundance of most microbes49. Elucidating the microbiome’s functions requires a comprehensive quantification of the transcripts, proteins and/or metabolites produced by the microbial community. Here, we used a metaproteomic approach we recently developed39 to simultaneously characterize the microbiome’s taxonomic biomass contributions and functional activity while developing and validating a scalable in vitro model for the Maintenance of gut microbiome Profiles (MiPro).

In conclusion, we evaluated the ability of the MiPro model to maintain microbial taxon-function stability and tested the utility of this model for high-throughput drug-microbiome interactions studies. We optimized the medium and culture model for scalable microbiome culturing. The optimized model showed improved performance in sustaining viability, diversity, compositional and functional profiles of the inoculum microbiome. We observed a high degree of in vitro–in vivo correlation of compositional and functional responses to metformin treatment. Our work provides an effective experimental platform for drug-microbiome interaction studies.

The medium composition for MiPro was based on our previously suggested medium composition22, which comprises: 2.0 g L−1 peptone water, 2.0 g L−1 yeast extract, 0.5 g L−1 L-cysteine hydrochloride, 2 mL L−1 Tween 80, 5 mg L−1 hemin, 10 μL L−1 vitamin K1, 1.0 g L−1 NaCl, 0.4 g L−1 K2HPO4, 0.4 g L−1 KH2PO4, 0.1 g L−1 MgSO4⋅7H2O, 0.1 g L−1 CaCl2⋅2H2O, 4.0 g L−1 NaHCO3, 4.0 g L−1 porcine gastric mucin (cat# M1778, Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.5 g L–1 bile salts. Based on this composition, two media containing either commercialized mixed bile salts (0.5 g L−1, 1:1 sodium cholate: sodium deoxycholate mixture, cat# 48305, Sigma-Aldrich) or a primary bile salts composition (0.25 g L−1 sodium cholate and 0.25 g L−1 sodium chenodeoxycholate) were compared for further optimization. To identify the ideal physical culturing conditions, samples were cultured either in 1 ml of media in 96-deep well plates or in 2 ml of media in culturing tubes (cat#T406-2A, Simport, Canada). The 96-deep well plate was covered with a silicone gel mat with a vent hole on each well made by a sterile syringe needle. During culturing, plates and tubes were shaken at 500 rpm with digital shakers (MS3, IKA, Germany). The optimal medium and culturing condition for the MiPro model was then determined based on its ability to maintain gut microbiome composition assessed as described below.

The human stool sampling protocol was approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board at the Ottawa Hospital (#20160585-01H). All participants signed informed consent to participate in the study. Briefly, ~ 3 g of fresh stool sample was collected from each individual using a 2.5 ml sterile sampling spoon (Bel-Art, United States). The spoon was dropped into a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 15 ml of sterile PBS pre-reduced with 0.1% (w/v) L-cysteine hydrochloride. The samples were immediately transferred into an anaerobic workstation (5% H2, 5% CO2, and 90% N2 at 37 °C). Before homogenization with a vortex mixer, the tube was uncapped for a few seconds to enable gas exchange and in particular oxygen removal. Sample homogenates were filtered using sterile gauzes and were immediately inoculated into each medium for static culturing at a final inoculum concentration of 2% (w/v). Culturing of an individual’s microbiome was carried out in 1 ml MiPro medium. The conventional basal culture medium (BCM)11 was also included for evaluating the performance of our improved medium. For each individual, 32 replicates were cultured for each medium, allowing for 4 replicates at 8 different time points. Microbiomes were characterized at 0 (immediately after inoculation), 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 34, and 48 h by measurements of the optical density at 595 nm (OD595), as a proxy of microbial growth and biomass, and by metaproteomic analyses. For testing the performance of MiPro over a longer period of time, an individual gut microbiome was cultured in the MiPro model, and 250 µl of the cultured suspension was replaced with same volume of fresh medium every 12 h. Microbiomes were collected at 0 h, 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5- days for metaproteomic analysis.

At 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 34 and 48 h, two 100 μl aliquots were removed from each sample for OD595 measurements. One of the aliquots was centrifuged at 16,000 ×g and the supernatant was used as the medium blank for the OD595 measurement. Viability of the microbiomes was tested at 0, 9, 24, and 48 h using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# L7012) in combination with flow cytometry64. Briefly, according to the manufacturer’s instruction, microbial cells were washed and diluted in 0.85% NaCl saline buffer. Then, the bacteria were stained with PI and SYTO for 15 min prior to acquisition on a BD FACSCelesta™ multicolor cell analyzer. For maximum bacterial cell viability, all sample processing procedures, including mixing, dilution and staining steps were performed inside the anaerobic station. For each sample, data were recorded for 2 min on the low flow rate setting. Bacterial cells were gated according to size and granularity on the FSC/SSC scatter plot. Live/dead cells were gated according to the gates set by the stained gut microbiome, the heat-treated and stained gut microbiome, and the unstained gut microbiome (Supplementary Fig. 3). Data were analyzed using Kaluza Analysis Software version 1.5. Live-gated bacterial cell counts were compared for its fold change in the cultured microbiome with respect to the inoculum, i.e. (cultured—inoculum)/inoculum.

In vitro and in vivo effects of metformin on the murine gut microbiome associated with a high-fat diet (HFD) were tested. Briefly, 7-week old male litter-mates from inbred C57/BL6 mice were single-housed and fed a 42% fat (by calories) diet (ENVIGO, TD.09682) for 6 weeks to allow stabilization of their microbiomes. Fresh stool pellets from each mouse were collected for in vitro culturing on day-0. The microbiomes were cultured in the absence or presence of metformin (cat# PHR1084, Sigma-Aldrich) using the MiPro model. The in vitro concentration of metformin was set to 6 mg/ml, emulating the 30% fecal recovery ratio of metformin previously reported from in vivo experiments41. Cultured microbiome samples were harvested at 24 h for metaproteomic analysis. For the in vivo experiment, mice were treated daily with 300 mg/kg of metformin through oral gavage. Stool pellets were collected for metaproteomic analysis at days 0, 14 and 28. The animal experiment was performed at the University of Ottawa and conducted in strict accordance with the guidelines of the Care and Use of Experimental Animals of Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC). The animal use protocol was approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of Ottawa (# BMI 2848).

Cultured gut microbiome samples were pelleted at 14,000 × g, 4 °C for 20 min, followed by two rounds of cell washing with PBS. Then large debris were removed with 300 × g centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min, followed by pelleting cells at 14,000 × g, 4 °C for 20 min. The microbial cell pellets were lysed by ultrasonication (Q125 Sonicator, Qsonica, LLC) in 200 µL lysis buffer (4% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate and 8 M urea in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0; plus Roche PhosSTOP™ and Roche cOmplete™ Mini tablets), and proteins precipitated overnight in acidified acetone/ethanol at −20 °C. Proteins were washed three times with ice-cold acetone, then dissolved in 6 M urea in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH = 8). Protein concentrations were determined by DC (detergent compatible) protein assay before an overnight trypsin digestion at 37 °C following protein reduction and alkylation 10 mM dithiothreitol and 20 mM iodoacetamide, respectively. Desalted tryptic peptides corresponding to 1 μg of protein were loaded for LC-MS/MS analysis with an Agilent 1100 Capillary LC system (Agilent Technologies, San Jose, CA) and run on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.). Peptides were separated with a tip column (75 μm i.d. × 50 cm) packed with reverse phase beads (1.9 μm/120 Å ReproSil-Pur C18 resin, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany). Peptide separation was performed using either a 90 min gradient for human samples or a 120 min gradient for mouse samples. The gradients included 5 to 30% (v/v) acetonitrile at a flow rate of 200 nL/min, for which 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water was used as solvent A, and 0.1% FA in 80% acetonitrile was used as solvent B. The instrument parameters included a full MS scan from 300 to 1800 m/z, followed by data-dependent MS/MS scan of the 12 most intense ions, a dynamic exclusion repeat count of two, and repeat exclusion duration of 30 s. All samples were run on LC-MS/MS in a random order. In addition, for the pre-experiment that evaluated bile salts composition and culture conditions, samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap XL following a 6 h gradient of 5–25% acetonitrile (v/v) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min, with 0.1% formic acid (FA) in water as solvent A and 0.1% FA in acetonitrile as solvent B. The full MS scan range was 350–1800 m/z, followed by five MS/MS scans performed in ion trap by CID (collision energy, 35%) in positive mode, dynamic exclusion repeat count of one, repeat duration of 30 s, and exclusion duration of 90 s.

Protein/peptide identification and quantification were carried out using the MetaLab software (version 1.0)37, which automates the MetaPro-IQ approach39. Database construction were based on an iterative database search strategy using gut microbial gene catalogs (for cultured human microbiomes, human gut microbial gene catalog with 9,878,647 sequences from http://meta.genomics.cn/ and for mice microbiomes, mouse gut microbial gene catalog database comprising 2,572,074 genes, obtained from http://gigadb.org) and a spectral clustering strategy. The peptide and protein lists were generated by applying strict filtering based on a FDR of 0.01, and quantitative information of proteins were obtained with the maxLFQ algorithm; quantitative taxonomic analyses were achieved by assigning identified peptides the taxonomic lineage of their lowest common ancestor (LCA) through the pep2tax database and summing up the intensities of the peptides. Functional annotations (COG, KEGG) were obtained with MetaLab version 1.1.0.

For the in vitro–in vivo microbiome experiments, protein groups were filtered with the criteria that the protein groups should be present in ≥50% (Q50) in each of the listed subgroups (including in vitro untreated versus in vitro 24 h treated, in vivo untreated versus in vivo day 14 or day 28 treated samples). A partial least squares—discriminant analyses (PLS-DA) test was performed on shared proteins among listed subgroups using the online tool MetaboAnalyst (www.metaboanalyst.ca/). Protein groups with a VIP score >1 were annotated to the corresponding KEGG categories. Then all protein groups annotated with these KEGG categories were extracted from the original protein group file. In vitro–in vivo correlation of the microbiome drug response was evaluated based on taxonomic and pathway changes after metformin treatment. Pearson’s correlation coefficient r was calculated using R function cor(). Taxonomic composition analysis was done using MetaboAnalyst.
