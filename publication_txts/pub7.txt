Dynamic Changes in the Gut Microbiome at the Acute Stage of Ischemic Stroke in a Pig Model



Stroke is a major cause of death and long-term disability affecting seven million adults in the United States each year. Recently, it has been demonstrated that neurological diseases, associated pathology, and susceptibility changes correlated with changes in the gut microbiota. However, changes in the microbial community in stroke has not been well characterized. The acute stage of stroke is a critical period for assessing injury severity, therapeutic intervention, and clinical prognosis. We investigated the changes in the gut microbiota composition and diversity using a middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion ischemic stroke pig model. Ischemic stroke was induced by cauterization of the MCA in pigs. Blood samples were collected prestroke and 4 h, 12 h, 1 day, and 5 days poststroke to evaluate circulating proinflammatory cytokines. Fecal samples were collected prestroke and 1, 3, and 5 days poststroke to assess gut microbiome changes. Results showed elevated systemic inflammation with increased plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha at 4 h and interleukin-6 at 12 h poststroke, relative to prestroke. Microbial diversity and evenness were reduced at 1 day poststroke compared to prestroke. Microbial diversity at 3 days poststroke was negatively correlated with lesion volume. Moreover, beta-diversity analysis revealed trending overall differences over time, with the most significant changes in microbial patterns observed between prestroke and 3 days poststroke. Abundance of the Proteobacteria was significantly increased, while Firmicutes decreased at 3 days poststroke, compared to prestroke populations. Abundance of the lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus was reduced at 3 days poststroke. By day 5, the microbial pattern returned to similar values as prestroke, suggesting the plasticity of gut microbiome in an acute period of stroke in a pig model. These findings provide a basis for characterizing gut microbial changes during the acute stage of stroke, which can be used to assess stroke pathology and the potential development of therapeutic targets.

An estimated seven million adults in the United States suffer from stroke each year, making it the fifth leading cause of death and the first leading cause of long-term disability (Benjamin et al., 2019). The immune response and inflammation are major stroke components effecting severity, as they can significantly exacerbate the primary stroke injury and cause further cell death in the brain (Deb et al., 2010; Borgens and Liu-Snyder, 2012). High levels of systemic inflammation are closely associated with poor stroke outcomes in stroke animal models and patients (Di Napoli et al., 2001; Audebert Heinrich et al., 2004; Elkind et al., 2004; McColl et al., 2007, 2008). Interestingly, it has recently been demonstrated that the gut microbiome changes in response to stroke (Swidsinski et al., 2012; Yin et al., 2015; Durgan et al., 2019) and that modulating the gut microbiome can alter the poststroke inflammatory response, leading to improved recovery in rodent models (Benakis et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2016; Yamashiro et al., 2017; Spychala et al., 2018). Few studies have assessed the changes in the microbial populations during the acute stage of stroke, making it critically important to better characterize these microbial alterations to identify potential biomarkers for injury severity, recovery, and therapeutic targets.

In the current study, we investigated the changes in gut microbial diversity and composition in a MCAO stroke pig model developed by our research team (Duberstein et al., 2014; Platt et al., 2014; Baker et al., 2017). The results of this study conducted in a translational large animal model will help characterize patterns of bacterial changes during the acute stage of stroke, potentially providing future insight into stroke severity, recovery, and therapeutic targets.

All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and the study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the NIH’s guide for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals (AUP approval number: A2017 07-019-Y2-A16). Seven castrated male Landrace pigs (5–6 months old, 48–56 kg) were individually housed in a room in which the temperature was kept at 27°C, with a 12-h light/dark cycle.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted 1 day poststroke using a General Electric 3.0 T MRI system to confirm ischemic stroke. Pigs were anesthetized using the aforementioned anesthesia protocol and placed in a supine position using an 8-channel torso coil. T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences were used in conjunction with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps to confirm the presence of ischemic lesions.

Peripheral blood was collected prestroke and 4 h, 12 h, 1 day, and 5 days poststroke, and plasma was separated and stored at −80°C. Circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were quantified by ELISAs (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, United States) to determine changes in inflammatory response.

Fecal samples were collected prestroke and 1, 3, and 5 days poststroke. Samples were obtained directly from the rectum using sterilized plastic fecal loops (5 cm within the rectum). To prevent any contamination during fecal collection, all materials were sterilized prior to sample collection. Pig anus was stimulated with a sterilized loop for defecation, and the stool was collected into a sterilized sample tube without any contact to the floor or body. The fecal samples were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until further analysis.

Bacterial DNA was extracted from fecal samples using a previously validated approach described by Rothrock Jr., Hiett et al. (2014). In this method, 330 mg of fecal material is subjected to a combination of mechanical and enzymatic processes using a modified version of the FastDNA Spin Kit for Feces (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, United States) and the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, United States). DNA purification was carried out using the DNA Stool–Human Stool–Pathogen Detection Protocol of the QIAcube Robotic Workstation. Following purification, DNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (Synergy H4 Hybrid Multimode Microplate Reader; BioTek, Winooski, VT, United States).

The extracted DNA samples were sent to the Georgia Genomics and Bioinformatics Core1 to sequence the 16s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. The V3–V4 region was amplified using the S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17 (5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′) and S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21 (5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′) primer pair (Klindworth et al., 2013). Samples were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). Sequencing data were provided as FASTQ files, which were merged and converted into FASTA files, and further analyzed using the QIIME pipeline v1.9.1 (Caporaso et al., 2010). Sequences were clustered as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% similarity, and representative sequences were aligned to the Greengenes database (gg_13_8_otus). Singleton OTUs and OTUs whose representative sequences could not be aligned were excluded from the analysis. The computed alpha-diversity indexes are as follows: number of observed OTUs, Shannon index, and evenness. Beta-diversity was computed using the weighted UniFrac distance matrix. This metric was chosen because it accounts for the phylogenetic relationship when calculating beta-diversity.

Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (Version 8.1.1; GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, United States) and are shown as mean ± SEM. Paired t-tests were used to measure the contrasts between pre- and poststroke time points. Differences in beta-diversity were accessed by two-sample t-tests between each individual time point, and the non-parametric P-values generated by the Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test were used for inferences. Regression analysis was performed to evaluate associations between microbiome changes and stroke severity. For all statistical tests, P ≤ 0.05 were considered significant, and trends were declared when 0.05 < P < 0.10.

Non-invasive MRI allows for real-time, longitudinal assessment of stroke pathophysiology and is a critical clinical tool commonly used to differentiate between stroke type and severity (González, 2012; Baker et al., 2017). We confirmed ischemic stroke 1 day poststroke in all animals in the study. Both T2-FLAIR and DWI sequences showed edematous lesions with bright hyperintense signal (Figures 1A,B), whereas ADC maps exhibited cytotoxic edema with dark hypointense regions due to restricted water diffusion (Figure 1C). Lesion volume, midline shift, and hemorrhage volume of the same cohort of pigs have been recently published (Kaiser et al., 2020). In brief, DWI sequences showed territorial hyperintense lesions at 1 day poststroke with an average volume of 9.9 ± 1.4 cm3. Analysis of T2-weighted (T2W) sequences revealed a significant (P < 0.01) increase in ipsilateral hemisphere volume indicative of cerebral swelling when compared to the contralateral hemisphere (26.0 ± 1.8 cm3 vs. 22.5 ± 1.4 cm3, respectively) and an associated midline shift of 2.5 ± 0.6 mm. Acute intracerebral hemorrhage was observed via T2Star sequences with a mean hemorrhage volume of 1.7 ± 0.1 cm3. Collectively, MRI results demonstrated that MCAO led to tissue-level damage including ischemic infarction, hemispheric swelling, pronounced midline shift, and intracerebral hemorrhage (Kaiser et al., 2020).

Elevated systemic inflammation has been associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis and correlated with increased brain infarction (McColl et al., 2007, 2008). Elevated systemic inflammation results in poor clinical outcomes and increased mortality in stroke patients (Di Napoli et al., 2001; Elkind et al., 2004), making it a key biomarker in stroke (Di Napoli and Papa, 2006). In MCAO pigs, plasma TNF-α was increased ∼28% at 4 h poststroke relative to prestroke levels (79.75 ± 6.00 pg/ml vs. 61.62 ± 6.38 pg/ml, respectively, P = 0.003, Figure 2A). Comparatively, TNF-α levels rapidly dropped following this peak and reached the lowest level at 1 day poststroke (43.75 ± 4.38 pg/ml, P = 0.003). TNF-α levels returned to prestroke levels by 5 days poststroke (53.36 ± 5.57 pg/ml). Similar to TNF-α, plasma IL-6 levels were significantly increased ∼20% at 12 h poststroke compared to prestroke (52.46 ± 2.44 pg/ml vs. 44.01 ± 0.85 pg/ml, respectively, P = 0.01) and returned to prestroke levels by 5 days poststroke (44.94 ± 1.07 pg/ml, Figure 2B), confirming an elevated inflammatory response during the acute stage of stroke in the pig model.

Changes in diversity of gut microbiome are often an indicator of dysbiosis associated with disease pathology (Kriss et al., 2018). In MCAO pigs, microbial diversity and evenness were altered during the acute stage of stroke as shown in Table 1. The Shannon and evenness indices were reduced (P ≤ 0.05) at 1 day poststroke compared to prestroke but returned to prestroke levels at 3 days poststroke. However, the number of observed OTUs, which is an estimator of microbial richness, was not significantly affected (P ≥ 0.21) during the course of the study. Consequently, poststroke values were not significantly different from prestroke values (Table 1).

Beta-diversity was assessed using the weighted UniFrac distance matrix to investigate the similarity of microbial patterns among groups. There was a trend (P = 0.07) for overall differences across all time points (Figure 4). The most distinct separation in the UniFrac distance was observed between 3 days post- and prestroke (Figure 4C). Taken together, the alpha-diversity was decreased at 1 day poststroke, and beta-diversity was most distinctly different 3 days poststroke compared to prestroke.

The composition changes in gut microbiota were evaluated at different taxonomic levels (phylum, family, and genus) during the acute stage of ischemic stroke (Figures 5–7). The most prevalent phyla prestroke were Firmicutes (89.94 ± 1.65%), followed by Bacteroidetes (3.45 ± 1.02%), Actinobacteria (1.83 ± 0.70%), and Proteobacteria (1.13 ± 0.65%, Figure 5). The composition of these four major phyla changed during the acute stage of stroke. At 3 days poststroke, the abundance of Firmicutes was decreased by 27% (66.08 ± 7.35% vs. 89.94 ± 1.65%, P = 0.01), while Proteobacteria significantly increased 19-fold relative to prestroke levels (20.96 ± 5.50% vs. 1.13 ± 0.65%, P = 0.01). At 5 days poststroke, both phyla returned to prestroke levels (Firmicutes, 86.86 ± 3.70% and Proteobacteria, 0.68 ± 0.19%). Similar to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria reached their highest abundance 3 days poststroke (3.78 ± 0.85% vs. 1.83 ± 0.70%, P = 0.02 compared to prestroke) and showed comparable levels to prestroke at 5 days poststroke (2.20 ± 0.93%). The second most abundant phylum at prestroke, Bacteroidetes, tended to increase 3 days poststroke (7.63 ± 1.53% vs. 3.45 ± 1.02%, P = 0.06) compared to prestroke and remained consistent at 5 days poststroke (7.13 ± 2.58%, Figure 5B). The ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was decreased ∼60% at 1 day poststroke compared to that of prestroke (17.33 ± 4.69% vs. 43.18 ± 12.59%, P = 0.04, Figure 5C) and returned to the levels observed prestroke at 3 days poststroke and remained stable, suggesting a significant microbial shift occurred at the acute stage of stroke. Other significant changes in bacterial phyla were observed in bacteria with relatively low abundance, including TM7, Cyanobacteria, and Fusobacteria, yet their abundance remained below 0.15% during the entire study (Figure 5B).

Regression analysis conducted to better understand the changes in microbial composition between prestroke and 3 days poststroke and stroke severity at the acute stage of stroke indicates that changes in abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria were positively correlated with lesion volume, MLS, and hemorrhage volume, while Firmicutes was negatively correlated with the stroke severity (Table 2). Moreover, changes in abundance of Lactobacillaceae and Lactobacillus were negatively related to the stroke severity (Table 2), supporting that the changes in microbial composition at the acute stage of stroke is closely related to stroke severity.

In this study, we investigated alterations in microbial composition during the acute stroke phase in a MCAO pig ischemic stroke model. The fecal microbiome was dynamically changed during this stage, as follows: (1) stroke reduced species diversity and evenness 1 day poststroke and changed bacterial community patterns (beta-diversity) among groups 3 days poststroke; (2) the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was decreased 1 day poststroke; (3) high abundance of Proteobacteria and low abundance of the genus Lactobacillus were observed 3 days poststroke. These results showed a dynamic compositional change in bacteria following a stroke event, particularly 3 days poststroke, and that this was transient with most microbiome metrics returning to prestroke levels by 5 days poststroke. Interestingly, increases in the systemic inflammatory response measured by circulating TNF-α and IL-6 were observed along with changes in fecal microbiome at the acute stage of stroke. This initial study demonstrates the plasticity of the gut microbiome during the acute stage of stroke, which occurred concurrently with systemic inflammation.

The role of inflammation in neurological diseases has been widely recognized (Di Napoli et al., 2001; Audebert Heinrich et al., 2004; Elkind et al., 2004; McColl et al., 2007, 2008), and alterations in the bacterial community due to disease have been correlated with changes in inflammatory responses (Benakis et al., 2016; Winek et al., 2016; Yamashiro et al., 2017; Spychala et al., 2018; Zeraati et al., 2019). Consistent with previous findings, increased plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines were observed in the current study, concurrent with the changes in gut microbiome composition. Increased gut permeability and translocation of bacteria to host tissues have been previously reported in stroke conditions (Crapser et al., 2016; Stanley et al., 2016), supporting the involvement of the gut microbial population in stroke pathophysiology. It is well known that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria (Hurley, 1995) trigger an immune response by binding to Toll-like receptor 4 in endothelial cells, activating monocytes/macrophages, and nuclear factor kappa B signaling cascades, resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α (Cario et al., 2002; Mafra et al., 2014). Proinflammatory cytokines contribute to the disruption of tight junction proteins between the epithelial cells, leading to an increase in gut permeability (Katzenberger et al., 2015) as well as translocation of bacteria and microbial-derived end products into the blood stream in what is known as “leaky gut syndrome.” Leaky gut syndrome results in a cycle of increasing inflammation that is detrimental to stroke patients, which could potentially be mitigated by therapeutic treatments that alter the composition of the gut microbial composition.

The present study demonstrated, for the first time using a large translational animal model such as swine, the plasticity of the gut microbiome during the acute stage of stroke. These changes included significant shifts in microbial diversity, the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and the abundance of Proteobacteria and Lactobacillus. Importantly, the microbial changes were significantly correlated with the severity of brain lesion measured by MRI. Given the significant degree of physiological similarities between swine and humans, findings from the current study contribute to increasing our understanding of the pathophysiology of stroke in human patients. Future studies investigating the role of the microbiome and its effect on the stroke immune response are warranted to understand the effect of therapeutic treatments on the gut microbiota in stroke patients.
