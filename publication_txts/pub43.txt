Vertical transmission of the gut microbiota influences glucose metabolism in offspring of mice with hyperglycaemia in pregnancy

Hyperglycaemia in pregnancy (HIP) is a common metabolic disorder that not only poses risks to maternal health but also associates with an increased risk of diabetes among offspring. Vertical transmission of microbiota may influence the offspring microbiome and subsequent glucose metabolism. However, the mechanism by which maternal gut microbiota may influence glucose metabolism of the offspring remains unclear and whether intervening microbiota vertical transmission could be used as a strategy to prevent diabetes in the offspring of mothers with HIP has not been investigated. So we blocked vertical transmission to investigate its effect on glucose metabolism in the offspring.

We established a murine HIP model with a high-fat diet (HFD) and investigated the importance of vertical transmission of gut microbiota on the glucose metabolism of offspring via birth and nursing by blocking these events through caesarean section (C-section) and cross-fostering. After weaning, all offspring were fed a normal diet. Based on multi-omics analysis, biochemical and transcriptional assays, we found that the glucometabolic deficits in the mothers were subsequently ‘transmitted’ to the offspring. Meanwhile, the partial change in mothers’ gut microbial community induced by HIP could be transmitted to offspring, supported by the closed clustering of the microbial structure and composition between the offspring and their mothers. Further study showed that the microbiota vertical transmission was blocked by C-section and cross-fostering, which resulted in improved insulin sensitivity and islet function of the offspring of the mothers with HIP. These effects were correlated with changes in the relative abundances of specific bacteria and their metabolites, such as increased relative abundances of Bifidobacterium and short-chain fatty acids. In particular, gut microbial communities of offspring were closely related to those of their foster mothers but not their biological mothers, and the effect of cross-fostering on the offspring’s gut microbiota was more profound than that of C-section.

Our study demonstrates that the gut microbiota transmitted via birth and nursing are important contributors to the glucose metabolism phenotype in offspring.

Among adolescents and young adults, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing precipitously, and HIP is one of the most important risk factors for T2DM development among the respective offspring [1]. HIP is a very common metabolic disorder during pregnancy that consists of two categories: pregestational diabetes (PGDM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [2]. It is estimated that in 2021, there were 21 million (16.7%) live births to women who had some form of HIP [3]. HIP not only causes β cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in children [4, 5], but also confers an almost doubled risk of developing T2DM later in life [6, 7]. Identifying the specific mechanism by which maternal HIP affects glucose metabolism in offspring will help develop intervention strategies to prevent T2DM development in offspring.

In this study, to investigate the effect of vertical microbiota transmission on glucose metabolism of offspring, we built HIP model and applied C-section and/or cross-fostering to block the vertical transmission. We observed that blocking of vertical mother-to-offspring microbial transmission led to an improvement in insulin sensitivity and islet function of the offspring. By assessing changes in the offspring microbiota and faecal metabolites, we showed that microbiota acquired via birth and nursing respectively was significantly different, suggesting that birth and nursing contribute to formate the structure and composition of the gut microbiota and faecal metabolites in offspring. Our findings indicate that a healthy gut microbiome is essential for mothers in pregnancy to avoid disrupted microbiota vertical transmission to their offspring, because the disrupted microbiota may result in impaired glucose metabolism on their offspring. For mothers with HIP, early intervention on offspring’s microbiota (such as supplementation of probiotics or prebiotics) is key to correct abnormal gut microbiota and reduce the risk of T2DM in offspring.

We first developed a HIP mouse model with a high-fat diet (HFD) or a normal chow diet (NCD) for 8 weeks before mating (Fig.
1a). As expected, mice with HFD feeding (the mHF group) had significantly greater weight gain than maternal mice with normal chow diet (NCD) feeding (the mNC group) after 8 weeks HFD (Fig.
1b), coinciding with an increased blood glucose level measured by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and area under the curve (AUC) value (Fig.
1c), indicating that the HIP model was established successfully. mHF and mNC were then mated with male mice of the same age with NCD feeding, and female mice were maintained on the same diet that they received during their pre-gestational period. All offspring were delivered vaginally and raised by their respective mothers. At weaning (postnatal day 21), all offspring were strained an NCD after weaning (Fig.
1a). Although the body weight of offspring from mHF mice (HF group) was lower than that of offspring from the mNC mice (NC group), it increased rapidly from 1 week of age (Fig.
1d). At 4 weeks of age, the HF group showed a higher glucose AUC value following an OGTT owing to the impairment in glucose clearance ability at 0 and 120 min after glucose injection (Fig.
1e). Compared with that of the NC group, significant increases in the serum insulin concentrations were noted in the HF group (Fig.
1f) in parallel with reduced insulin sensitivity in an insulin tolerance test (ITT) (Fig.
1g). The HF group showed lower high-glucose (HG)-coupled insulin secretion in a glucose-stimulated insulin secretion test (GSIS) than the NC group (Fig.
1h). Pdx1 and MafA, which play an important role in pancreatic development and β cell function maintenance, decreased expression indicated dysfunction of β cells in the HF group (Fig.
1i). Overall, these data show that the offspring of mothers with an abnormal glucose metabolism present altered glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.

In a word, we found that both HIP mothers’ glucometabolic phenotype and their gut microbiome could be ‘transmitted’ to the offspring, and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may cause diabetes. Based on this, we speculate that the vertical transmission of the gut microbiota plays an important role in the development of the glucose metabolism status of offspring. As such, we hypothesize that blocking vertical transmission would prevent development of altered glucose metabolism in offspring of mothers with HIP.

To investigate the effect of vertical mother-to-infant transmission of the gut microbiota via delivery on glucose metabolism, we blocked vertical microbiota transmission through C-section, and all offspring were fostered by their biological mothers (Fig.
2a).

In summary, after blocking microbial vertical transmission by C-section, insulin resistance was ameliorated and insulin secretion was promoted in the offspring of mice with HFD-induced impairment of glucose metabolism, and these changes were accompanied by changes in faecal metabolite levels.

We further evaluated the effect of vertical transmission of the gut microbiota through nursing on glucose metabolism by implementing cross-fostering in our experimental model. After natural delivery, offspring were fostered by the mother from the other group (e.g. offspring born from the mNC group but fostered by the mHF group named NC-CF) (Fig.
3a). In the offspring from the mNC group, although there were no differences in glucose tolerance and insulin resistance between the NC-CF and NC groups (Fig.
3b, c), insulin sensitivity of NC-CF group showed an impairment (Fig.
3d). Nevertheless, for the offspring from the mHF group compared with the HF group, cross-fostering was also to relieve hyperinsulinism (Fig.
3c), accelerate insulin sensitivity (Fig.
3d) and potentiate islet function (Fig.
3f, h) in the HF-CF group. These results indicate that cross-fostering ameliorated the impaired glycometabolic phenotype of HF offspring.

Altogether, these results indicate that microbiota transmission via nursing made the microbiota composition of offspring trend toward that of their foster mother; this phenomenon is also observed with the glycometabolic phenotype.

Given the role of delivery mode and maternal nursing in shaping the gut microbiota, the effect to block microbiota transmission via both mechanisms on glucose metabolism of the offspring was studied. To this end, we subjected offspring of two maternal groups to both delivery by C-section and cross-fostering (HF-CS-CF and NC-CS-CF, respectively) and compared glucose metabolism and microbiome with those of natural delivery and maternal nursing (HF and NC, respectively) (Fig.
4a). Compared with the NC group, the offspring from mNC that was delivered by C-section and underwent mHF fostering (the NC-CS-CF group) exhibited impaired insulin sensitivity (Fig.
4d), and serum insulin levels in the NC-CS-CF group were higher than those in the NC-CF group (p<0.05) (Fig. S4), suggesting that the effect of the combination of the two blocking methods was stronger than that of either individually. Otherwise, in the offspring from mHF, we observed that glucose intolerance and insulin resistance were mitigated in the HF-CS-CF group compared with the HF group (Fig.
4b–d). More importantly, both the blood glucose levels and serum insulin levels in the HF-CS-CF group were lower than those in the HF-CF group (Fig. S4), suggesting that C-section amplified the effect of cross-fostering. Additionally, C-section combined with mNC fostering strengthened HG-coupled insulin secretion in the HF offspring (Fig.
4f). A similar tendency could be observed for the expression of Pdx-1 (Fig.
4h). However, the results of the NC-CS-CF group versus the NC group showed no statistical difference (Fig.
4e, g).

Collectively, the results suggested that the combination of C-section and cross-fostering showed more significant effects than either intervention alone on the glycometabolic phenotypes of the offspring of both the mNC and mHF groups, and marked differences in the gut microbiota structure and faecal metabolite levels were observed only in the offspring of the mHF group.

To explore the vertical transmission of the gut microbiota under the different glucose metabolism statuses, we explored the shared microbial taxa between birth mothers and their offspring independently of the delivery method and foster mother. For the mNC group and their offspring, 597 (96+145+65+18+210+15+34+14) shared ASVs were observed between the mNC group and NC offspring group, and 618 and 369 shared ASVs were found between the mNC group and the NC-CS and NC-CF groups, respectively (Fig.
5a). Additionally, 373 ASVs were transmitted from the mNC group mothers to the NC-CS-CF group offspring. Among the 597 shared ASVs between the mNC and NC groups, the transmission of 143 (96+18+15+14) ASVs to the offspring was blocked by C-section, and that of 328 (145+96+65+18) ASVs was blocked by cross-fostering. The combination of C-section and cross-fostering blocked the transmission of 289 (145+96+34+14) shared ASVs. The mHF group and HF offspring groups had 396 shared ASVs (52+35+22+14+47+159+18+49), and there were 332 and 363 shared ASVs between the mHF group and the HF-CS and HF-CF groups, respectively. In addition, 345 ASVs were transmitted to the HF-CS-CF group from the mHF group. Among the 396 shared ASVs, the transmission of 139 (52+22+47+18) ASVs to offspring was blocked by C-section, and that of 123 (52+35+14+22) ASVs was blocked by cross-fostering. The combination of C-section and cross-fostering blocked the transmission of 154 (52+35+18+49) shared ASVs.

All the different ASVs identified between offspring groups in the above analysis were clustered into 15 co-abundance groups (CAGs) based on their SparCC correlations (Fig.
5d). There are 3 ASVs (ASV19_Romboutsia, ASV52_Muribaculaceae and ASV109_Muribaculaceae) not only the hub ASV of 3 CAGs (CAG2, CAG12 and CAG109, respectively), but also the members of the maternal core ASVs specific in the mHF group (Fig.
5b, d). All the differential metabolites between offspring groups in the above analysis were clustered into 12 modules based on their bicor correlations (Fig.
5d). Based on this, we analysed the correlations among the CAGs, faecal metabolite modules and glucometabolic phenotypes in all offspring groups (Fig.
5e). Interestingly, the 2 CAGs we mentioned above, CAG2 and CAG6, were both positively correlated with two glucose metabolism-related parameters (FBG and IRT_30min) and negatively correlated with six faecal metabolite modules (module2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 13) including dipeptide-containing leucine (a BCAA) and salicylic acid, and these faecal metabolite modules showed positive correlations with the two glucose metabolism-related parameters (FBG and IRT_30min) mentioned above.

In this study, we found that vertical transmission of the specific bacteria and their metabolites contributed to the development of glucose metabolism defects in the offspring from mothers with HIP. Furthermore, the similarity of gut microbial structure between offspring and their fostering mothers was higher than that between children and their birth mothers.

In this study, we also explore the cross-talk between delivery method and fostering by NC-CS-CF and HF-CS-CF groups. mHF fostering influence on the faecal metabolites of their offspring is very remarkable through vaginal delivery no matter who the birth mothers were, but which was almost completely suppressed when C-section. Nevertheless, the influence of mNC fostering was hardly affected by delivery mode, and even expressed a stronger influence with C-section. These results suggested that delivery mode and fostering did not act independently in the vertical transmission of gut microbiota, but their effects of the “inherence” of impaired glucose metabolism are far from superimposed.

Partially blocking vertical microbial transmission led to improvement in insulin sensitivity and islet function of the offspring. Importantly, microbiota acquired via birth and nursing respectively are significantly different and they play different roles in the formation of the structure and composition of the gut microbiota and faecal metabolites.

Specific pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6 mice at 7 weeks of age were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China, SCXK-2016-0006) and housed in a standard SPF environment (room temperature, 21-25 °C; room humidity, 30–70%; 12-h light/12-h dark cycle) with free access to food and water. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Renmin Hospital of Zhengzhou University.

After 1 week of adaptive feeding, female mice were randomly assigned to two groups, and they were given a HFD (containing 60% kcal fat, Research Diets, D12492) or a NCD for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of HFD induction, an oral OGTT was performed to evaluate the degree of insulin resistance in the female mice. Subsequently, female mice mated with male mice, and all litters were weaned at 3 weeks and fed a NCD until 8 weeks of age.

All offspring in our study were divided into 8 groups, which were (1) HF, born to HFD-fed mothers (mHF) by vaginal delivery and fostered by the mHF group; (2) HF-CS, born to the mHF group by C-section and fostered by the mHF group; (3) HF-CF, born to the mHF group by vaginal delivery and cross-fostered by NCD-fed mothers (mNC group); (4) HF-CS-CF, born to the mHF group by C-section and cross-fostered by the mNC group; (5) NC, born to the mNC group by vaginal delivery and fostered by the mNC group; (6) NC-CS, born to the mNC group by C-section and fostered by the mNC group; (7) NC-CF, born to the mNC group by vaginal delivery and cross-fostered by the mHF group; and (8) NC-CS-CF, born to the mNC group by C-section and cross-fostered by the mHF group. The pancreas was collected from all offspring at 8 weeks, and faecal samples were collected at both 4 and 8 weeks.

When the offspring were 4 weeks old, an OGTT was performed by orogastric gavage of 50% glucose (2 g/kg body weight) after overnight fasting [45]. Blood (5–10 μL) was collected from the tail vein at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min following glucose administration to measure blood glucose by glucometer. Serum was collected from the blood by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min, and the serum insulin concentration was quantified with an ELISA kit (Crystal Chem Inc., Downers Grove, IL). An ITT was performed by intraperitoneal injection of recombinant human short-acting insulin (0.75 U/kg) after 4 h of fasting. Blood (5–10 μL) was collected at 0, 15, 30, 60 and 90 min following insulin administration for blood glucose measurement.

Upon euthanasia, the pancreas and bile duct were exposed to air. A bile duct catheter was introduced, followed by digestion via injection of collagenase (Sigma, USA). Then, pancreatic islets were isolated and collected individually under a microscope. Islets were cultured overnight with RPMI-1640 (GIBCO, USA) medium at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Subsequently, islets were washed twice with a buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing 20 mmol/L HEPES, 115 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L NaHCO3, 5 mmol/L KCl, 2.6 mmol/L CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/L KH2PO4, 1.2 mmol/L MgSO4, 3 mmol/L D-glucose and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) [46].

A GSIS was performed as previously described. Briefly, cultured primary islet cells were preincubated with 200 μL of glucose-free KRBH buffer containing 675 mmol/L NaCl, 18 mmol/L KCl, 2.5 mmol/L MgSO4·7H2O, 2.5 mmol/L NaH2PO4·2H2O, 7.5 mmol/L CaCl2·2H2O, 10 mmol/L NaHCO3, 50 mmol/L HEPES and 1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, the cells were exposed to 200 μL of KRBH buffer containing 3.3 mmol/L or 16.7 mmol/L glucose for a 1-h incubation at 37 °C. The insulin content of the supernatant was quantified with a mouse insulin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem, USA). Glucose stimulation index (GSI) = insulin release in high glucose state/insulin release in low glucose state.

Total RNA was extracted from the pancreas using TRIzol reagent. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using a RevertAid First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), and qPCR assays were performed using SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix on a Roche LightCycler 480 II Sequence Detection System (Roche Diagnostics). β-actin served as the reference gene, and the primer sequences were as follows: Pdx-1, F: 5′-ATGAACAGTGAGGAGCAGTACTACG-3′ and R: 5′-GGAGCCCAGGTTGTCTAAAT-3′; MafA, F: 5′-ATCATCACTCTGCCCACCAT-3′ and R: 5′-AGTCGGATGACCTCCTCCTT-3′; and β-actin, F: 5′-TGACAGGATGCAGAAGGAGA-3′ and R: 5′-GCTGGAAGGTGGACAGTGAG-3′.

All data are presented as the mean±SD. Two-tailed independent Student’s t test was used to assess the significance of differences between two groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparisons among three or more groups, followed by the Holm–Šidák or Tukey post hoc test for all pairwise multiple comparisons. A P value <0.05 was considered indicative of significance.

Faeces from maternal mice were collected at day 7 and day 14 during pregnancy and antepartum and day 7 and day 14 during lactation. Faeces from offspring were collected at 4 weeks and 8 weeks of age. Faecal samples from the progenies of the two groups were taken at the age of 4 weeks and 8 weeks, respectively, and immediately placed in a −80°C refrigerator or liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. Avoid urine contamination of stool samples during collection. All samples were sequenced and analysed after collection.

Representative sequences for ASVs were built into a phylogenetic tree using phylogeny plugin (align-to-tree-mafft-fasttree pipeline) in QIIME2 and were taxonomically assigned using the Silva database (release 132) [49]. For determination of the α-diversity, the Shannon index values and observed ASVs were evaluated in QIIME2 using diversity plugin (core-metrics-phylogenetic pipeline) and visualized using GraphPad Prism 8. To test the variation in the gut microbiota, Jaccard distances between samples were evaluated and PCoA (principal coordinate analysis) based on Jaccard distances were performed in QIIME2 using diversity plugin (core-metrics-phylogenetic pipeline). The results were visualized with GraphPad Prism 8 to show the variations in the gut microbiota structure in mice. The differences in microbiome Shannon index, observed ASVs and principal coordinate variables among the groups were tested using Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test with GraphPad Prism 8 software. LEfSe (http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/) was used to select ASVs with significant differences between two groups. The differential ASVs between maternal mice were visualized in heatmap using R package pheatmap (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pheatmap/index.html.) The distribution of maternal core gut microbiota in all the groups was visualized also using R package pheatmap. Venn diagrams were generated using an online tool (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/).

Analyses were performed using an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system (1290 Infinity LC, Agilent Technologies) coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight instrument (AB Sciex TripleTOF 6600). For hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) separation, samples were analysed using a 2.1 mm ×100 mm ACQUITY UPLC BEH 1.7 μm column (Waters, Ireland). In both electrospray ionization (ESI) positive and negative ion modes, the mobile phases were as follows: A=25 mM ammonium acetate and 25 mM ammonium hydroxide in water, and B=acetonitrile. In auto tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) acquisition, the instrument was set to acquire over the m/z range of 25–1000 Da, and the accumulation time for the production scan was set at 0.05 s/spectrum. The production scan was acquired using information-dependent acquisition (IDA) with high-sensitivity mode selected. The collision energy (CE) was fixed at 35 V with ±15 eV. The declustering potential (DP) was set at ±60 V [50].

The raw MS data (wiff. scan files) were converted to MzXML files using ProteoWizard MSConvert and processed using XCMS for feature detection, retention time correction and alignment. The metabolites were identified by accuracy mass (<25 ppm) and MS/MS data, which were matched with our standards database. First, orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed on the metabolites detected in positive ion mode and negative ion mode respectively by SIMCA-P software (version 1.6.1). Then, metabolites detected in positive ion mode and negative ion mode were merged, and the following analysis were all based on the merged data. OPLS-DA of merged data was performed using R package ropls to test the variation of the faecal metabolites of mice between different groups, and the variable influence on projection (VIP) values of each metabolite in the model was obtained. Wilcoxon rank sum tests adjusted with original FDR method of Benjamini and Hochberg of the faecal metabolites between different groups were performed using R package MASS. The fold changes (log2 transformed) of metabolites between the groups were calculated in R 3.6.3. Metabolites that meet the conditions that VIP in OPLS-DA model > 1, |fold change (log2 transformed) |>1 and FDR < 0.05 were considered as the significant different metabolites between the groups.

All the different ASVs identified between groups were clustered into co-abundance groups (CAGs) based on their SparCC correlations using the Ward clustering algorithm via the R package WGCNA [51]. The SparCC correlation coefficients of the ASVs were calculated using FastSpar (https://github.com/scwatts/FastSpar). Clusters were identified with the dynamic hybrid tree-cutting algorithm using a deepSplit of 2 and a minimum cluster size of 5 for clusters.

All the differential metabolites between groups were clustered into modules also using the R package WGCNA. Signed, weighted metabolite co-abundance correlation networks were calculated for all examined offspring mice in WGCNA using bicor() function [52]. A scale-free topology criterion was used to choose the soft threshold β = 12 for metabolites correlations. Clusters were identified with the dynamic hybrid tree-cutting algorithm using a deepSplit of 4 and a minimum cluster size of 5 for clusters. And the Hub ASV and metabolite was defined as the ASV or metabolite with highest module membership (MM) value in each CAG or module.

The spearman correlation coefficients of the differential ASVs, differential faecal metabolites and clinical parameters were calculated using MATLAB R2019b using corr() function. The P-values of the correlations were adjusted to FDR values with original FDR method of Benjamini and Hochberg. And the correlations were defined as significant when FDR < 0.05.
