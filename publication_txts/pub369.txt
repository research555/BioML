Weaning Age and Its Effect on the Development of the Swine Gut Microbiome and Resistome



Piglets are often weaned between 19 and 22 days of age in North America, although in some swine operations this may occur at 14 days or less. Piglets are abruptly separated from their sow at weaning and are quickly transitioned from sow’s milk to a plant-based diet. The effect of weaning age on the long-term development of the pig gut microbiome is largely unknown. Here, pigs were weaned at either 14, 21, or 28 days of age, and fecal samples were collected 20 times from day 4 (neonatal) through marketing at day 140. The fecal microbiome was characterized using 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The fecal microbiome of all piglets shifted significantly 3 to 7 days postweaning, with an increase in microbial diversity. Several Prevotella spp. increased in relative abundance immediately after weaning, as did butyrate-producing species such as Butyricicoccus porcorum, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Megasphaera elsdenii. Within 7 days of weaning, the gut microbiome of pigs weaned at 21 and 28 days of age resembled that of pigs weaned at 14 days. Resistance genes to most antimicrobial classes decreased in relative abundance postweaning, with the exception of those conferring resistance to tetracyclines and macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B. The relative abundance of microbial carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) changed significantly in the postweaning period, with an enrichment of CAZymes involved in degradation of plant-derived polysaccharides. These results demonstrate that the pig gut microbiome tends change in a predictable manner postweaning and that weaning age has only a temporary effect on this microbiome.

IMPORTANCE Piglets are abruptly separated from their sow at weaning and are quickly transitioned from sow’s milk to a plant-based diet. This is the most important period in commercial swine production, yet the effect of weaning age on the long-term development of the pig gut microbiome is largely unknown. Metagenomic sequencing allows for a higher-resolution assessment of the pig gut microbiome and enables characterization of the resistome. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing to identify bacterial species that were enriched postweaning and therefore may provide targets for future manipulation studies. In addition, functional profiling of the microbiome indicated that many carbohydrate and metabolic enzymes decrease in relative abundance after weaning. This study also highlights the challenges faced in reducing antimicrobial resistance in pigs, as genes conferring tetracycline and macrolide resistance remained relatively stable from 7 days of age through to market weight at 140 days despite no exposure to antimicrobials.

In commercial swine production, the suckling-weaning transition is the most critical period for piglet health. When piglets are weaned, they are abruptly separated from their sow and their diet is changed from an easily digestible milk-based one to a more complex plant-based diet. The risk of developing health problems is increased as piglets are subjected to stress as a result of mixing with unfamiliar piglets, handling, and separation from the sow (1). This stress frequently leads to reduced feed intake immediately following weaning, which negatively affects growth performance (2). Consequently, newly weaned piglets frequently develop postweaning diarrhea, resulting in significant economic losses due to associated piglet morbidity, mortality, and treatment (3). Weaning times vary, but piglets can be weaned as young as 14 days or less in some North American commercial swine operations. Earlier weaning ages allow for a greater number of piglets weaned per sow per year and may also decrease the risk of transmission of certain pathogens from the sow to piglets. However, piglets that are weaned relatively early may be more susceptible to disease and other complications (4).

As with humans and other mammals, the gut microbiome is an important factor affecting swine health. There are an estimated 17 million plus microbial genes in the pig gut microbiome (5), compared to 20,000 to 25,000 genes in the swine genome (6). This greatly expands the genetic potential of the host, particularly as certain microbes can metabolize otherwise nondigestible dietary carbohydrates into a usable energy source. It has been well documented that the pig gut microbiome undergoes a rapid shift following weaning, including a decrease in members of the Proteobacteria phylum and Bacteroides genus and an increase in genera such as Prevotella, Roseburia, and Succinivibrio (7,–10). However, relatively little is known about how weaning age affects the short- and long-term development of the pig gut microbiome. In this study, we weaned pigs at three different ages (14, 21, and 28 days) and collected fecal samples 20 times from the neonatal stage until they reached market weight. The fecal microbiome and resistome were assessed using 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to determine how weaning age affected both over the course of the swine production cycle.

As expected, all pigs gained less weight in the 7-day postweaning period compared to pigs that were either still nursing or had already been on solid feed for longer than 7 days (Fig. 1). From day 35 onward, pigs from all weaning age groups grew at the same rate. There was also no association with weaning age and a pig being removed from the study due to antimicrobial treatment or death (P > 0.05).

The 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the mock community reflected the expected composition, with minor exceptions. There was a larger than expected relative abundance of Clostridium (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) and an absence of Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes); however, this species is known to be poorly amplified by the primers used in this study (11). After processing, there were 35,448 ± 1,247 (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]) 16S rRNA gene sequences and 16,699,263 ± 680,292 shotgun metagenomic paired-end sequences per sample. For the metagenomic samples, host contamination accounted for 42.3% ± 2.0% of the sequences.

Weaning age had a strong but temporary effect on the gut microbial community structure (Fig. 2; see Fig. S1 and S2 in the supplemental material). Within 3 days of weaning (day 18), the day-14-weaned pigs had a gut microbiota that was significantly different from that of the pigs that were still nursing (by permutational multivariate analysis of variance [PERMANOVA], R2 > 0.25 and P < 0.001). By 25 days of age, the gut microbiota of piglets weaned on day 21 was significantly different from that of both the day-14- and day-28-weaned groups (by PERMANOVA, R2 ≥ 0.13 and P < 0.001). However, on day 28, the day-14- and day-21-weaned piglets largely clustered together and separately from the day-28-weaned piglets, which were still nursing up to that point. Interestingly, the gut microbial community structure of piglets weaned at 28 days of age remained significantly different from that of the day-14-weaned pigs at day 35 and from the day-21-weaned pigs until and including day 42.

Bacterial species that were consistently associated with nursing pigs included Anaeromassilibacillus senegalensis, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridioides difficile, Clostridium porci, Clostridium scindens, Desulfovibrio piger, Escherichia coli, Phocaeicola vulgatus, and Shigella sonnei (see Table S4 in the supplemental material). At 35 days of age, only three bacterial species were differentially relatively abundant between the day-14- and day-21-weaned pigs and those weaned on day 28: Bariatricus massiliensis, B. porcorum, and D. piger, all of which were enriched in the day 14-weaned pigs (Table S4). Once the pigs had reached 70 days of age, there were no bacterial species with a relative abundance greater than 0.1% that differed among the groups (P > 0.05).

Functional profiling of the gut microbiome was carried out using the MetaCyc metabolic pathway database and the CAZy database of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). The relative abundance of the CAZymes and MetaCyc pathways shifted in a similar way to the microbial taxa postweaning (Fig. 4A and
B). The CAZymes are grouped into the following classes: auxiliary activities (AAs), carbohydrate esterases (CEs), glycoside hydrolases (GHs), glycosyltransferases (GTs), polysaccharide lyases (PLs), and carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), which have no enzymatic activity but aid and enhance the catalytic activity of other CAZymes. In total, 237 CAZy families were detected among all samples (see Table S5 in the supplemental material), in comparison with only 61 found within the pig genome (see Table S6 in the supplemental material). All of the CAZyme classes decreased in relative abundance after weaning (Fig. 4C). Overall, 61.5% of the CAZymes were classified as glycoside hydrolases and 24.7% as glycosyltransferases. However, there were still a number of CAZy families that were enriched in the gut microbiomes of postweaned pigs compared to those still nursing (see Table S7 in the supplemental material). The only AA identified was AA10 (copper-dependent lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases) and in only 35 of the samples (Table S5).

A large number of MetaCyc metabolic pathways were also differentially abundant between weaned and nursing piglets at day 21 (196 unique pathways) and day 28 (231 unique pathways), with the majority enriched in the gut microbiome of nursing piglets (see Table S8 in the supplemental material and Table S9 at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5619817.v1). As with the CAZymes there was an enrichment of MetaCyc pathways involved in fucose and lactose degradation in the nursing piglets and an increased relative abundance of certain starch degradation pathways postweaning.

Antimicrobial resistance remains a serious challenge to the swine industry, and therefore, we also characterized the antimicrobial resistome of the pigs longitudinally and in response to weaning age. Similar to the functional analysis, samples clustered by weaning age on days 21 and 28, when assessed using the relative abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) (Fig. 5A). The large majority of ARGs that were differentially abundant were enriched in the nursing piglets compared to the weaned pigs (see Table S10 at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5619817.v1). Notable ARGs that were more relatively abundant in the weaned pigs included blaACI-1, cfxA6, erm(Q), tet(44), and tet(L). The relative abundance of ARGs conferring resistance to multiple drugs, aminoglycosides, polypeptides, and quinolones, as well as several other drug classes, decreased postweaning in all weaning age groups (Fig. 5B). However, tetracycline resistance genes remained relatively stable throughout the pig production cycle. Of the 250 unique ARGs detected, tet(Q), tet(W), tet(O), aph(3′)-IIIa, mel, tet(W/N/W), tet(40), and tet(44) were the most relatively abundant among all samples (see Table S11 at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5619817.v1).

As expected, there was a substantial shift in the pig gut microbiome within 3 days of weaning. The sudden change from a milk-based diet to one that is plant based and less digestible by the pig is largely responsible for this shift immediately postweaning (1, 14). However, weaning age had no apparent long-term effects on the gut microbiome or the average daily gain of the pigs. A recent study by Massacci et al. (15) that also weaned pigs at different ages (14, 21, 28, and 42 days), with sampling up to 60 days of age, also reported no weaning age effect on the microbial community structure at 60 days. Therefore, it appears that a later weaning age only delays postweaning changes in the gut microbiome rather than affecting the assembly and stability of the microbial community.

In conclusion, this study shows that weaning age has little effect on the long-term development and composition of the pig gut microbiome and resistome. Instead, the pig gut microbiome tends to change in a rather predictable manner postweaning in a swine production environment. Many ARGs also persisted in the feces of the pigs throughout the study, likely reflecting the long history of use of certain antimicrobial classes in swine production. Several bacterial species with potential beneficial properties such as SCFA production were found to be enriched postweaning and are attractive targets for future microbiome manipulation and culture-based studies.

All pig experiments were carried out at the swine unit of the Lacombe Research and Development Centre. Seven pregnant sows that farrowed within 24 h of each other were used in the study. A total of 45 piglets (n = 15 per weaning age group) were randomly selected for inclusion in the study based on litter, weight, and sex, with low-weight piglets excluded. Following weaning, all pigs were fed the same starter diet that was free of antibiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics (see Table S12 at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5619817.v1). Any pig that required an antibiotic treatment was removed from the study. Animals in this experiment were cared for in agreement with the Canadian Council for Animal Care (2009) guidelines. The Lacombe Research and Development Centre Animal Care Committee reviewed and approved all procedures and protocols involving animals.

On day 4 prior to sampling, 15 piglets were randomly chosen from among the 7 litters and designated to be weaned at 14, 21, or 28 days of age (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Piglets were sampled using fecal swabs (FLOQSwabs; Copan, Murrieta, CA, USA) beginning at 4 days of age and repeated on days 7 and 11. At 14 days of age, piglets assigned to the day-14 weaning group were removed from their sow after sampling and transferred to a nursery room within the swine barn. Fecal sampling continued for all piglets at 15, 18, and 21 days of age. On day 21, piglets in the day-21-weaned group were removed from their sow and placed in a nursery room. Fecal samples were taken from all pigs on days 22, 25, and 28, and on day 28, the day-28-weaned piglets were weaned from their sow and placed in the nursery room. Piglets were then sampled on days 29, 32, 35, 42, 49, 56, 70, 84, 112, and 140. All fecal swabs were immediately placed on ice, transported to the laboratory, and stored at −80°C until DNA extraction.

DNA was extracted from fecal material collected on FLOQSwabs with the QIAamp BiOstic bacteremia DNA kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) as per the manufacturer’s instructions, with the following modifications. Sterile scissors were used to remove the swab, which was then placed into a PowerBead tube with MBL solution and agitated at 70°C and 400 rpm for 15 min. After heating, the tubes were shaken in a FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA) at 4.0 m/s for 45 s. Tubes were allowed to rest in the MP FastPrep-24 for 5 min. Using sterile forceps, swabs were removed from PowerBead tubes prior to pelleting debris at 10,000 × g for 2 min. All remaining steps were followed as per the manufacturer’s protocol.

DNA from days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 70, and 140 of all pigs that remained in the study through day 140 was also subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Metagenomic libraries were prepared using 700 ng of DNA and the TruSeq DNA PCR-free library prep kit (Illumina, Inc.) following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Briefly, DNA was fragmented to an average length of 400 bp with a Covaris LE220 instrument, end repaired, A-tailed, and indexed with TruSeq Illumina adapters. Libraries were then validated on a Fragment Analyzer system with a high-sensitivity NGS fragment kit (Agilent Technologies, Mississauga, ON, Canada) to check for size and quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using the Kapa Library Quantification Illumina/ABI Prism kit protocol (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA). Equimolar quantities of each library were then pooled and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument with an SP flowcell (2 × 250 bp) following manufacturer’s instructions.

The 16S rRNA samples were processed using DADA2 v.1.14 (50) in R v.3.6.3. Briefly, the forward and reverse reads were trimmed to 200 and 210 bp, respectively, merged with a minimum overlap of 75 bp, and chimeras removed. The RDP naive Bayesian classifier (51) and the SILVA SSU database release 138 (52) were then used to assign taxonomy to each merged sequence, referred to here as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 100% similarity. OTUs that were classified as chloroplasts, mitochondria, or eukaryotic in origin and those that were identified in the extraction control samples at an equal or higher abundance than in the biological samples were removed prior to analyses. The number of OTUs, Shannon diversity index, inverse Simpson’s diversity index, and the Bray-Curtis dissimilarities were calculated in R v.4.0.0 using Phyloseq 1.32.0 (53) and vegan v.2.5-6 (54). To account for uneven sequencing depth, all samples were randomly subsampled to 6,900 sequences per sample prior to analyses.

Metagenomic sequences were trimmed (quality score of <15 over a sliding window of 4 bp; minimum length of 50 bp) and sequencing adapters removed using Trimmomatic v.0.38 (55). Bowtie2 v.2.4.2-1 (56) was used to align host sequences to the Sus scrofa genome (Sscrofa11.1) for removal. Taxonomy was assigned to the filtered metagenomic sequences using Kaiju v.1.7.3 (57) and the NCBI nonredundant protein database (13 October 2020). For functional profiling of the metagenomic samples, HUMAnN v.3.0.0.alpha.1 (58) was used to align reads to the UniRef90 database, which were then collapsed into MetaCyc metabolic and enzyme pathways (59). Reads were aligned to the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) v.3.0.8 (60) and the Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) Database (dbCAN2) v.07312020 (61) using DIAMOND v.0.9.28 (62) (≥90% amino acid identity and ≥ 90% coverage).

Fisher’s exact test was used to determine if weaning age was associated with removal from the study postweaning due to antimicrobial treatment or death. The effect of weaning age on the microbial community structure was assessed using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarities and PERMANOVA (adonis2 function). The R package pairwiseAdonis (63) was used to compare the Bray-Curtis dissimilarities within each sampling time, and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to correct P values for multiple comparisons. The effect of weaning age on the relative abundance of microbial species, CAZy families, MetaCyc pathways, and ARGs was determined using MaAsLin2 (microbiome multivariable associations with linear models) v.1.5.1 (64) in R. Only those microbial species with an average relative abundance of at least 0.1% and CAZy families, MetaCyc pathways, and ARGs identified in at least 25% of samples were included in these analyses.
