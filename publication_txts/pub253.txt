Effects of gut microbiome and environment on the development of eczema in Chinese infants

Eczema is a relapsing and persistent inflammatory skin disease affecting about one-fifth of children worldwide. As in other developed countries, the prevalence of this chronic disease in Hong Kong is approximately 30%. Moreover, the number of local cases reported has been on a rising trend since 1995. Eczema frequently starts in early infancy. A total of 45% of all cases begin within the first six months of life, 60% during the first year and 85% before the age of 5. The pathophysiology of eczema is multi-factorial and is a complex inter-relationship between skin barrier, genetic predisposition, immunologic development, microbiome, environment, nutrition, and pharmacological and psychological factors.

To characterize the longitudinal changes of gut microbial profile in early childhood and to examine the association between gut microbiome diversity, environmental factors and the development of eczema in early childhood.

We will conduct a longitudinal cohort study that follows 1250 Hong Kong Chinese infants for 2 years and assess the gut microbiome and other potential environmental factors in the aetiology of eczema. Parents will be asked to provide demographic data, their infant birth data, allergy condition, diet, environmental conditions as well as the data on maternal stress. Stool specimen will be collected for gut microbiome diversity analysis. We will examine newborn infants at enrollment, at 4 months, 1 year and 2 years after birth.

This study will evaluate the association between gut microbiome, environmental factors and the development of eczema in Chinese infants. Findings from this study may be used to develop a predictive path model to guide effective health promotion, disease prevention and management.

Eczema is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory skin disease affecting about 20% of children and 3% of adults worldwide.[1,2] Approximately 70% of cases of eczema start in early childhood, under 5, and only about 10% in adulthood.[3] Among the cases of early childhood onset, about 50% develop symptoms within the first year of life.[1] In Hong Kong, the prevalence of eczema is on a rising trend, a 0.12% increase per year since 1995.[4] Summarizing the results of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood, Chan et al[4] noted that the prevalence of life-time eczema in children was 30.7%.

Both gut microbiome and environmental factors are essentially concerned in the development of eczema, and are also associated with the severity of the disease. In the light of this, we propose to initiate a birth cohort study, examining newborn infants at enrollment, 4 months, 1 year and 2 years after birth. We will access their gut microbiota profile, and measure different environmental factors that may be associated with the disease. This cohort study will help us to understand and pinpoint the gut microbiome and different environmental factors involved in the development and severity of eczema in Chinese children.

This will be a prospective birth cohort study of 1250 Chinese newborns. The subjects will be recruited from Department of Paediatrics in Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. Subjects’ parents will be asked to provide demographic data, their infant birth data and allergy condition. The cohort will be followed for 2 years, with 3 follow-up measurement points to assess the diet, environment and allergy condition of the infants at the ages of 4 months, 1 year and 2 years. Parental stress will also be assessed. Stool specimens from the newborns will be collected for gut microbiome diversity testing at enrollment, 4 months, 1 year and 2 years of age. It is expected that the whole study will take 36 months to complete.

1250 new-born infants will be recruited and followed for two years in the Department of Paediatrics of the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. We will recruit full-term infants from the postnatal ward. General population cohort will be included with regardless of family history. The inclusion criteria are in Chinese ethnicity and reside in Hong Kong. The infants with GI disorders after birth, received intravenous injection of antibiotics, admitted to neonatal ICU, whose mothers have fever or an infection or are currently taking antibiotics will be excluded.

This study was registered on the ISRCTN Registry with reference number ISRCTN44080054. The study protocol was approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong – New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee with reference number 2016.321. Any modifications to the protocol that may have an impact on the execution of the study will be reported to the committee. Potential subjects’ parents will be given detailed information about the study and their rights to participate. Written informed consent will be obtained from the subjects’ parents prior to data collection.

1250 new-born infants will be recruited. The hospital averages of 5000 deliveries per year. According to our anecdotal prevalence data, about 30% (∼375 cases) of the infants will develop eczema in the first 2 years of life. It is estimated that an accumulation of 375 event cases would be sufficient to detect a hazard ratio of a standardised normally distributed continuous risk factor and a binary risk factor as small as 1.16 and 1.94 respectively, with 80% power at a 1-sided 2.5% level of significance, on the basis of the very mild assumption that the prevalence of underlying binary risk factors is not too extreme, that is, within 5% to 95%. Moreover, this sample size would also be adequate to detect a binary risk factor with a risk ratio (RR) as small as 1.42 to 2.00 and a normally distributed continuous risk factor with a RR as small as 1.17 to 1.44 at 80% power and 1-sided 2.5% level of significance, provided the prevalence of the underlying binary risk factor was within 5% to 95% and the probability of eczema at the mean value of the continuous risk factor was also within 5% to 95%. This study also aims to examine the mediating role of microbiome diversity on the relationships between environmental and lifestyle risk factors and development of eczema using path analysis. A commonly used rule of thumb[23] suggests that a sample size of at least 100 and preferable ≥ 200 is required for conducting path analysis. In consideration of both statistical and financial criteria, a random subsample of totally 150 children of the cohort will be undergone gut microbiome examination of their stool specimens collected.

Demographic data will be collected at enrolment by self-report. This information includes: gender, body weight and body length of the infant, gestational age, mode of delivery, feeding practice (breast or formula feeding), emollient use, parents’ education level and household income.

The infant's allergy condition will be assessed by the modified parent proxy version of the Comprehensive Early Childhood Allergy Questionnaire developed by Minasyan and colleagues. Data will be collected by a research assistant at enrollment, and at the age of 4 months, 1 year and 2 years.

Comprehensive Early Childhood Allergy Questionnaire is designed to detect eczema, asthma and IgE-mediated food allergies in children aged from 1 to 5. It assesses allergic diseases, family history of allergy, parental socio-economic status, parental smoking and child's feeding patterns. It has been validated with good psychometric properties and has been translated and modified to reflect the Chinese situation under the standard procedure before being used in this study. Some questions, such as those concerned with the history of infection, use of antibiotic, pet ownership, air quality, number of siblings and mode of delivery, have been added to the questionnaire. The modified questionnaire has been reviewed by an expert panel of paediatricians, geneticists, paediatric nurses, academics, medical scientists and parents of children with eczema. The feasibility, appropriateness and acceptability of the questionnaire are confirmed by five proxy parents of eczematous children, taking an average of 7 minutes to answer the questionnaire in full.

The subjects’ dietary factors will be assessed by a parent proxy dietary practice questionnaire, adopted from the Chinese version of the eating-habit module of the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System, Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection. The information will be collected from parents when the children are at the age of 4 months, 1 year and 2 years. Information on the mother's diet and use of supplements during pregnancy will be collected after the birth by means of the same questionnaire.

Maternal stress will be assessed at 4 time points: at enrollment, at 4 months, 1 year and 2 years. Mothers will be asked to complete the 10-item perceived stress scale to assess their own stress levels. There are 10 items, measured on a five-point Likert scale, from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). The Chinese version has been reported to have good validity and internal consistency.[24]

A total of 150 infants who confirmed to have eczema based on the assessment by the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index at 2-year will be selected for microbiome diversity profiling. A similar infant microbiome study has demonstrated that a sample size of 100 is enough for the detection of significant changes in the gut community composition.[25] Infants will be followed for 2 years for development of eczema and other allergic diseases such as recurrent wheeze, food allergy and rhinitis, and the stored stool specimens of a stratified random subsample of 150 infants will be selected for gut microbiome analysis on the basis of severity of eczema as assessed by the SCORAD index at 2-year. Fifteen children in each of the 10 strata based on the deciles of the SCORAD index will be randomly selected using computerized randomization. Stool samples from all newborns will be collected from the napkin and suspended in 0.6 mL lysis buffer (TIANGEN Biotech, Beijing, China). The colonisation and development of the gut microbiome will be followed at 10 days post-birth, 4 months, 1 year and 2 years (modified from Storrø et al[22]). Stool samples will be stored at -80°C before analysis. Total microbial DNA will be extracted from the stool using the TIANamp stool DNA kit. The quantity and quality of the total microbial DNA will be verified by the NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermal Scientific, Texas, USA) and Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies, California, USA) respectively. A total of 600 metagenomic libraries from 4-time points (at enrollment, 4 months, 1 year and 2 years) of 150 infants will be constructed using the PCR primers flanking the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. All PCR will be performed in triplicate to minimise the effect of amplification bias. Following PCR using the high-fidelity enzyme, amplicons with different barcodes will be analysed using the Bioanalyser 2100 and Qubit spectrophotometer. Equimolar amounts of amplicon libraries (∼80 libraries per run) will be pooled for next-generation sequencing using the MiSeq platform (Illumina, California, USA).

The metagenomic data set will be analysed using the open source bioinformatics tool Mothur. Briefly, cleaned sequence reads will be trimmed and aligned to the bacterial-subset SILVA, followed by filtering to remove vertical gaps. The reads are then screened for potential chimeras using the uchime method and finally classified using the Ribosomal Database Project's naïve Bayesian classifier training set for Mothur. Differentially abundant bacterial taxa, PcoA loadings, species richness (Sobs), Shannon's diversity (H’) and evenness (EH) and Simpson's diversity will be calculated using the Mothur workflow.

Data will be suitably transformed, if applicable, before being subjected to inferential analyses. In particular, the frequency data of relative abundance of the differentially abundant bacterial taxa identified will be arc-sine square root-transformed. A mixed-effects model will be used to identify environment and lifestyle risk factors associated with the development of eczema by using a log-binomial link function for estimating the relative risks of the factors identified based on the whole cohort. If a more exact time of eczema development can be recorded, Cox regression with possibly time-varying covariates will be used instead to examine environment and lifestyle risk factors associated with the development of eczema. A mixed-effects model will also be used to examine the longitudinal association of gut microbiome diversity in the development of eczema by using the sub-sample with microbiome data. Furthermore, path analysis will be performed to examine whether the mediating role of microbiome diversity in the relationships between environmental risk factors and the development of eczema based on the random sub-sample. The significance of the mediating effects will be determined by bias-corrected bootstrapping method with 10,000 replications. The bootstrapping will be performed using Matlab 7.0 (The Mathworks, Inc). Except as specified above, all other statistical analyses will be performed using SAS release 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Eczema is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder that is regarded as a typical multifactorial disease. It affects up to 230 millions of people globally.[26] Onset is usually in the first few weeks and months of life and, while most affected people enter spontaneous remission, the dermatitis may persist into adult life. The etiology is complex and the disease is caused by a combination of immune dysregulation, genetic susceptibility, environmental factors and impaired barrier function.[27,28]
