Anthropogenic interferences lead to gut microbiome dysbiosis in Asian elephants and may alter adaptation processes to surrounding environments

Human activities interfere with wild animals and lead to the loss of many animal populations. Therefore, efforts have been made to understand how wildlife can rebound from anthropogenic disturbances. An essential mechanism to adapt to environmental and social changes is the fluctuations in the host gut microbiome. Here we give a comprehensive description of anthropogenically induced microbiome alterations in Asian elephants (n = 30). We detected gut microbial changes due to overseas translocation, captivity and deworming. We found that microbes belonging to Planococcaceae had the highest contribution in the microbiome alterations after translocation, while Clostridiaceae, Spirochaetaceae and Bacteroidia were the most affected after captivity. However, deworming significantly changed the abundance of Flavobacteriaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Weeksellaceae and Burkholderiaceae. These findings may provide fundamental ideas to help guide the preservation tactics and probiotic replacement therapies of a dysbiosed gut microbiome in Asian elephants. More generally, these results show the severity of anthropogenic activities at the level of gut microbiome, altering the adaptation processes to new environments and the subsequent capability to maintain normal physiological processes in animals.

Recently, the global loss of biodiversity has negatively affected ecosystems and threatened many wildlife populations1. Human activities are considered a leading factor by changing the biological characteristics of ecosystems and causing a loss of organisms, contributing to species extinction2. Scientists have tried to understand how animals can recover from these disturbances3–5. An essential mechanism to adapt environmental and social changes is the fluctuations in the host gut microbiome, which is important for mammalian host general health including immunity, nutrition and ecological adaptation6–8.

Previously, Myanmar has been holding the second largest wild elephant populations after India32. However, the numbers have declined to range between 1430 and 2065 due to habitat loss and mining33. Although the capture of wild elephants was banned in Myanmar in 1990, illegal capturing has continued until now18. In the 1990s, approximately 100 wild elephants were illegally exported from Myanmar every year34. In addition, about 21% of all Asian elephants in Europe were obtained from timber camps in Asia and about 60% are captured from the wild35. Given such findings and the challenges facing Asian elephant conservation and health, we performed a three-way study to clarify the gut microbiome dysbiosis associated with anthropogenic disturbances, more specifically overseas translocation, captivity and deworming. Translocation is known to be stressful event for the elephants36 and captive elephants have lower survival and reproductive rates than elephants in in-situ populations37. Previous research on humans38, 39, Amur tigers40 and equines41 have concluded that there were deworming-associated changes in the gut microbiome that could be due to indirect effects of parasite removal or the direct effect of the anthelmintic drug on the microbes. Our study benefits from large sample size and time series sampling in a large, long-lived endangered mammal with its gut microbiome rarely studied so far. A total of 16 semi-captive and 14 captive Asian elephants were investigated to evaluate the effect of three anthropogenic interferences on their gut microbiome. This study will help to provide ideas on how to replace or reestablish a normal microbiome in targeted elephant groups. Obtaining a deeper understanding of gut microbiome alterations in wildlife accompanying anthropogenic activities could be helpful in developing new strategies such as microbiota replacement therapies to undo the expected health problems that are likely to arise42. More generally, this study has wide potential to advance conservational and management practices to increase animal welfare not only in wild and captive populations of elephants but also in other animals with similar physiology and diet.

Ninety-one fecal samples were collected from 30 Asian elephants. A total of 7,328,206 raw paired-end reads were obtained from the Illumina MiSeq sequencer. According to the demultiplexing summary the forward and reverse reads were truncated at 300 and 280 bp, respectively. In addition, a total of 15 and 10 bp were trimmed from the forward and reverse primer regions, respectively. The DADA2 quality control analysis resulted in 3,982,258 high quality paired-end reads and classified into 9385 features. One sample was excluded from the analysis due to quality reasons.

The fecal samples that provided high-quality reads were filtered and divided into three groups. Each group was assigned to study the effect of translocation anthropogenic activity group (TAA), captivity anthropogenic activity group (CAA) or deworming anthropogenic activity group (DAA) on the gut microbiome of Asian elephants (Fig. 1).

The calculated alpha diversity using Shannon and Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (Faith’s_PD) analyses showed that Asian elephants are associated with highly diverse gut microbiome where Shannon diversity ranged from 5.4 to 8.7 “mean (SE) = 7.4 (0.1)” and Faith’s_PD ranged from 14.4 to 32.7 “mean (SE) = 25.6 (0.4)” (Figs.
2 and
3). In addition, both beta diversity metrics revealed a distinct clustering of the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of the gut microbiome of elephants (clustering coefficient = 0.95) in a response to each anthropogenic activity, translocation (TAA), captivity (CAA) and deworming (DAA) (Fig. 4).

The microbial diversity in DAA group was significantly greater in the samples collected 20 days post deworming as compared to those collected 10 days after, with significance tested by Wilcoxon-signed rank test by both Shannon diversity (Mean (SE) = 7.3 (0.1), Range = 2.3, and p < 0.01) and Faith’s_PD (Mean (SE) = 25 (0.7), Range = 14.9, and p < 0.01) (Figs.
2c and
3c). In contrast, oral administration of Albendazole 8 mg/kg accounted for changing variations in diversity of gut microbiome across time. PCoA plots based on both Jaccard and BC distances showed a shift of bacterial communities at 10 days after deworming and these communities shifted again to the opposite direction at 20 days after deworming (Fig. 4e,f). The dissimilarity was significant between gut microbiome in elephants before and after deworming (Permutations = 999, pseudo-F = 4.3, and p < 0.001, Pairwise PERMANOVA) (Fig. 5c). In addition, a significant difference in beta diversity of gut microbiome was observed in elephants 10 days and 20 days after deworming (Permutations = 999, pseudo-F = 5.9, and p < 0.01, Pairwise PERMANOVA) (Supplementary Fig. S1c).

To identify the relationships between each anthropogenic activity and the associated gut microbiomes in Asian elephants, the four most abundant bacterial phyla were compared between groups. The composition of gut microbiome across the examined elephants was dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes (Table
1). However, the abundance of these phyla was responded differently to each type of anthropogenic activities as tested by two-sample t-test. For example, the abundance of Proteobacteria (BT: 21.2% and AT: 2.3%) was lower in elephants after translocation in TAA group (t = − 3.9, df = 14.3, p < 0.01), while that of Bacteroidetes (BT: 23.1% and AT: 40.3%) (t = 7.3, df = 13.8, p < 0.01) and Spirochaetes (BT: 7.3% and AT: 12.1%) (t = 3.4, df = 15.2, p < 0.01) increased. In contrast, Firmicutes (10 Days before deworming (10BDW): 43.6%, 10 Days after deworming (10ADW): 30.1% and 20 Days after deworming (20BDW): 46.6%) and Spirochaetes (10BDW: 8.3%, 10ADW: 4.5% and 20BDW: 9.4%) appeared in significantly lower abundance at 10 days post deworming in DAA group than either before deworming (t = − 2.7, df = 24.9, p < 0.05 and t = − 2.9, df = 25.2, p < 0.01, respectively) or 20 days after (t = − 4.8, df = 22.0, p < 0.01 and t = − 4.6, df = 22.0, p < 0.01, respectively). The abundance of Proteobacteria at 10 days after deworming was significantly higher (t = 3.7, df = 16.3, p < 0.01) than 10 days before deworming (10BDW: 15.9%, 10ADW: 34.1%). While this abundance decreased significantly 20 days after deworming (20BDW: 8.7%) when compared to the abundance of Proteobacteria at 10 days after (t = 6.2, df = 17.9, p < 0.01). The observed strong shifts in abundance in TAA and DAA groups in response to translocation and deworming were not present in CAA group in relation to captivity (Table
1).

Likewise, the balance of taxa and proportion plots by gneiss analysis revealed that the average log ratios of the detected taxonomic groups increased in TAA group after translocation (y0 numerator taxa = 2403, y0 denominator taxa = 2189), in CAA group in captivity (y0 numerator taxa = 5334, y0 denominator taxa = 866) and in DAA group at 20 days after deworming (y0 numerator taxa = 2032, y0 denominator taxa = 3147) as compared to their respective controls (Fig. 6a–c & Supplementary Figs. S5–S8). The results of analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) showed that the percentile abundance of Planococcaceae (for example: Lysinibacillus) was significantly higher before translocation in TAA group (clr = − 6.2, W = 422). In contrast, the abundance of Clostridiaceae (for example: Sarcina; clr = 3.1, W = 449, and Clostridium butyricum; clr = 2.7, W = 408) and Bacteroidia (clr = 3.1, W = 445) was significantly higher in captivity in CAA group. However, abundance of Spirochaetaceae (for example: Treponema sp. OC1; clr = − 2.9, W = 444) was higher in semi-captivity individuals. Deworming was predominantly associated with significant alterations of the gut microbiome in elephants. The abundance of Flavobacteriaceae (for example: Flavobacterium, clr = 31.9, W = 513), Sphingobacteriaceae (for example: Sphingobacterium, clr = 70.3, W = 495), Xanthomonadaceae (for example: Stenotrophomonas, clr = 28.6, W = 485), Weeksellaceae (for example: Chishuiella, clr = 34.8, W = 486) and Burkholderiaceae (for example: Comamonas, clr = 17.2, W = 467) was significantly higher and lower at 10 and 20 days after deworming, respectively, as compared to 10 days before. A maximum abundance among groups analysis, by Vegan and Myseq packages in R software, was executed for each elephant group. The obtained heatmaps supported the results of ANCOM analysis as shown in Fig. 7a–c.

Recently, the study of gut microbiome has emerged as an important tool for monitoring the general health of mammals43, 44. Gut microbiome is known to be important to maintain the host health, immunity and behavior6–8, but it is largely unknown how human activities impact gut microbiome in mammals in general, and especially in endangered animals needing fast interventions to increase the health, survival and reproductive rates45, 46. This study provides insights to help understand how three different types of anthropogenic interventions alter the gut microbiome in Asian elephants. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to demonstrate the changes in gut microbiome associated with translocation, captivity and deworming in Asian elephants.

As most studies on endangered wildlife do not focus on anthropogenic-induced alterations of their gut microbiome, this study provides a rare opportunity to understand the effect of three different anthropogenic disturbances on the Asian elephants. Understanding the changes in host associated gut microbiome in relation to overseas translocation, captivity, and deworming regimes can guide future strategies to conserve threatened animal populations through management and treatment. There are promising new ways to manage gut microbiome dysbiosis in animals through transplantation and administration of probiotics 77. Fecal microbiome transplants were considered to be a future direction to treat gastrointestinal related disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and obesity78. However, care should be taken during selecting the healthy donors, preserving and delivering the transplant to the target animals to avoid possible negative effects on the recipients77. We encourage conservation practitioners and microbiome researchers dealing with gut microbiome dysbiosis in wild animals to collect fecal samples from the healthy adult individuals and preserve it by freezing for the future management and treatment of gastrointestinal dysbiosis in wild animals. Recently, oral delivery of the fecal microbiome transplant has helped to successfully change the altered gut microbiome of koalas to become similar to that of the wild ones79. Another way to deliver microbiome transplants to wildlife can be based on coprophagia80. In conclusion, differences in both composition and diversity that were detected between elephant groups, as a response to each human interference, require further investigation to interpret this study’s results in relation to stress hormones and the longevity of large mammals.

Fresh fecal samples were collected from three different groups of elephants for three independent experiments (Fig. 1). The TAA group included four elephants from Hmaw Yaw Gyi (HYG) camp in Myanmar, where they lived in semi-captive conditions. The age of this group ranged between 4 and 26 years old and consisted of three females and one male (Supplementary Table S1). Time series-sampling was implemented to confirm the observed alterations in gut microbiome were induced by the human activities including translocation, captivity and deworming, and not the other factors such as age, gender or location. Fecal samples were collected from each individual in this group on six separate occasions; three samplings were conducted in Myanmar in September 2017, January 2018 and May 2018 and this was followed by overseas translocation in November 2018 by a charter flight to Sapporo Maruyama Zoo in Hokkaido, Japan, where additional fecal samples were collected in December 2018, January 2019 and February 2019 (Table
1). Each translocated elephant was fed mainly on timothy grass, apple and carrot at Sapporo Maruyama Zoo (Supplementary Table S2). The CAA group included 14 elephants from Nay Pyi Taw Zoo (NZ) in Myanmar where they lived in full captive conditions and fed mainly on tiger grass, mulato grass and banana fruit (Supplementary Table S2); and an additional eight and four elephants as a comparison from HYG and Taung Kya (TK) camps in Myanmar, respectively, where they lived in semi-captive conditions (i.e., control group). The age of NZ elephants ranged between 4 and 26 years old and consisted of 9 females and 5 males, while the age of HYG and TK elephants was ranged between 7 months and 56 years old and consisted of 9 females and 3 males (Supplementary Table S1). Fecal samples were collected once from the captive elephants in February 2018, while two samples were collected from the semi-captive elephants: once in September 2017 and another in January 2018 (Table
1). One additional fecal sample was collected from two semi-captive elephants from HYG in May 2018. The DAA group included the same NZ elephants (n = 14) where they received a deworming dosage of Albendazole (8 mg/kg) in late February 2018 (Fig. 1). Fecal samples were collected at three time points: 10 days before, 10 days after and 20 days after the deworming event (Table
1).

The collected fecal samples were kept on ice until DNA extraction. Approximately 2 g of elephant feces were collected as soon as discharged through the rectum in a plastic container (F.T bottle, FEED Corp., Yokohama, Japan) and mixed with 6 mL of saline. Afterwards, the container was intensely shaken, and the resulting fecal mixture was transferred to a 1.5 mL tube. This was followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 min and the supernatant was discarded. This procedure was repeated to obtain 0.3–0.4 g stool pellet, which were used as fecal material for subsequent DNA extraction. Fecal microbial DNA was extracted using PowerFecal DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA) and DNA samples were kept at -80 °C until use.

The extracted DNA was used as a template for PCR amplification of the hypervariable regions V3-V4 of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using the Illumina barcoded forward primer: 5′-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′; and reverse primer: 5′-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTA­CHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′ as recommended by Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA). The library was prepared using the Nextera Index Kit (Illumina) and sequenced with a MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (600 cycles) on an Illumina MiSeq device according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Sequences were demultiplexed by BaseSpace (Illumina) and the obtained forward and reverse sequences were processed using QIIME 281 (version 2019.10.0) and merged together. The ASVs were quality-checked, corrected and filtered, and a feature table was constructed using DADA2 (version: 2019.10.0) pipeline82. The feature table was filtered and separated into three tables representing each group of elephants. Alpha diversity was calculated based on Shannon and Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity analyses. Wilcoxon-signed rank test was used to estimate the statistical differences in alpha diversities between elephant groups. Furthermore, beta diversity was calculated based on Jaccard and Bray–Curtis distance analyses using QIIME 2. PERMANOVA was performed to test for significant differences in beta diversity83. The results of both Wilcoxon-signed rank test and PERMANOVA were visualized with ggplot2 package in RStudio. In addition, visualization of clustering of ASVs according to translocation, captivity and deworming, was performed by a PCoA using EMPeror plugin in QIIME 284 according to the Jaccard and Bray–Curtis distance analyses results.

To examine the effect of each human activity on the gut microbiome of Asian elephants we used gneiss analysis86 in QIIME 2 through creating a balance of taxa and proportion plots of variants. Finally, ANCOM87 was implemented to identify microbes with the highest contribution in the dissimilarity of gut microbiome in elephant groups.

Sample collection from elephants was approved by the University of Veterinary Science, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation, and Myanma Timber Enterprise, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation, Myanmar. The sampling procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines established by the Animal Experiment Committee of the Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University (Sapporo, Japan). The study is reported in accordance with the ARRIVE (Animals in Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelines for reporting experiments involving animals.
