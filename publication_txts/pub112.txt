Gut microbiome–micronutrient interaction: The key to controlling the bioavailability of minerals and vitamins?



Micronutrients, namely, vitamins and minerals, are necessary for the proper functioning of the human body, and their deficiencies can have dramatic short‐ and long‐term health consequences. Among the underlying causes, certainly a reduced dietary intake and/or poor absorption in the gastrointestinal tract play a key role in decreasing their bioavailability. Recent evidence from clinical and in vivo studies suggests an increasingly important contribution from the gut microbiome. Commensal microorganisms can in fact regulate the levels of micronutrients, both by intervening in the biosynthetic processes and by modulating their absorption. This short narrative review addresses the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in influencing the bioavailability of vitamins (such as A, B, C, D, E, and K) and minerals (calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, and phosphorous), as well as the impact of these micronutrients on microbiome composition and functionality. Personalized microbiome‐based intervention strategies could therefore constitute an innovative tool to counteract micronutrient deficiencies by modulating the gut microbiome toward an eubiotic configuration capable of satisfying the needs of our organism, while promoting general health.

Micronutrients include organic and inorganic elements and compounds, such as minerals and vitamins, which are essential for the maintenance of host health and are not used for energy balance. Such micronutrients are commonly found in foods and dietary supplements, and are crucial for the regulation of biosynthetic cellular reactions, for example, those involved in immune and energy functions, 1 as well as in biological processes such as growth, bone health, and fluid balance. 2 Inadequate levels of micronutrients, resulting from reduced intake and/or poor absorption, are known to lead to specific micronutrient deficiency diseases, which represent a major global health concern. 3 , 4 Micronutrient deficiencies can also aggravate infections and noncommunicable chronic diseases, such as osteoporosis, hypothyroidism, cardiovascular disease and cancer, with a potentially dramatic impact on quality of life, morbidity and mortality. 3 , 5 , 6 For example, in children, vitamin D deficiency leads to poor physical and mental development, and contributes to the onset of inflammatory diseases and allergies. 7 , 8 Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to unbalanced immune responses even in adults, resulting in a higher incidence and progression of autoimmune diseases. 7 , 9 Among the most widespread intervention strategies to improve the micronutrient status thus reducing the disease burden, large‐scale fortification and public health programs must certainly be mentioned. Nonetheless, a growing body of evidence has highlighted some concerns about the negative consequences of supplementing certain micronutrients. 4 , 10 Oral iron supplementation has been linked to an increased incidence of constipation, gastric irritation, nausea, and metallic taste. 11 For infants and young children, the consumption of iron‐fortified foods has been associated with decreased growth, 12 impaired cognitive development, 13 , 14 and increased diarrhea probably due to altered to increased levels of intestinal pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli). 15 , 16 In addition, excessive vitamin A intake has been linked to increased bone fracture in both men and women. 17 , 18 Furthermore, despite supplementation, some deficiencies, such as those of iron, vitamin A, and zinc, have been shown to persist in certain individuals, underlining the involvement of other determinants of bioavailability. 4

In this short narrative review, our aim is to provide up‐to‐date evidence on the two‐way interaction between gut microorganisms and micronutrients. In particular, we summarize the available in vivo and clinical studies dealing with the gut microbiome role in influencing micronutrient bioavailability and the modulation of the microbiome by micronutrients. We will also provide some glimpses on the modulation of the gut microbiome to improve the host micronutrient status. An increased understanding of the underlying mechanisms may indeed pave the way for the development of microbiome‐based intervention strategies to reduce micronutrient imbalances and related diseases, thereby limiting unwanted supplementation and improving overall human health.

Microbes utilize micronutrients for their growth and biological functioning. It is therefore not surprising that the intake of micronutrients can influence the compositional and functional structure of the gut microbiome. For example, dietary supplementation with vitamin B, C, D, and E largely contributes to the microbiome composition, by favoring the expansion and colonization of the intestinal mucosa by beneficial genera such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Roseburia. 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 Minerals such as calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, and phosphorous can also shape the human gut microbiome. 21 , 22 In particular, high calcium intake has been associated with a higher proportion of Clostridium cluster XVIII in men, 30 iron supplementation could induce a depletion of Bifidobacterium and an increase in Lactobacillus levels in children, 31 and phosphorous supplementation leads to an increase in microbial diversity and levels of short‐chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in stool. 30 On the other hand, it has been shown that various members that make up the intestinal microbial ecosystem can influence the bioavailability of micronutrients, by controlling their absorption, particularly phosphorous and calcium, 32 and synthesizing vitamins, such as vitamin K and the water‐soluble fraction of B vitamins. 33

Below we will discuss the most recent in vivo and clinical studies on the bidirectional interaction between gut commensals and micronutrients, that is, minerals (calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, and phosphorous) and vitamins (A, B, C, D, E, and K). Figure 1 shows the summary of microbiome–micronutrient interactions in the gut.

The human gut microbiome comprises several bacteria that possess the ability to affect the host mineral status, both through the synthesis of a wide range of enzymes involved in the release of minerals from dietary sources, and by directly influencing the absorption rate at the gastrointestinal level. 21

Finally, several studies in animal models have pointed out associations between magnesium bioavailability and gut microbiome composition. 58 , 59 , 60 The few available studies in humans suggest that gut commensals and probiotic strains belonging to Lactobacillus spp. are effective in increasing the bioavailability of magnesium after cheese and vegetable milk consumption. 61 , 62 , 63 On the other hand, magnesium has been shown to exert a positive impact on the gut microbiome composition, as well as on the metabolism of vitamins B1 and D, in patients with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and obesity. 64

Some bacterial genera normally adapted to the human gastrointestinal tract niche, including, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Enterococcus, are well‐known to biosynthesize vitamin K and those of group B, more precisely the water‐soluble forms of the latter. 23 , 65 , 66 Furthermore, as reported for minerals, the gut microbiome can affect vitamin absorption rates as well as be affected by dietary supplementation, as will be detailed in this section.

Although fat‐soluble vitamins are not naturally produced by gut commensals, significant associations have been found between this subgroup of vitamins and the gut microbiome. For instance, in a large‐scale clinical study focusing on the host micronutrient status from the microbiome point of view, serum vitamin D levels were positively correlated with several members of the Firmicutes phylum, such as Ruminococcus, Coprococcus, Mogibacterium, and Blautia. 72 , 74 The modulatory effects of vitamin D are likely due to the control of the expression of antimicrobial peptides and the protective effects on the gut mucosa, that is, the maintenance of barrier integrity and epithelial healing. 75 , 76 , 77 In addition, a previous clinical study by Jones et al. highlighted a relationship between vitamin D and L. reuteri, probably mediated by the metabolism of bile acids, with important therapeutic repercussions given the widespread use of this microorganism as a probiotic. 78 Finally, the dietary intake of vitamin E has been positively associated with SCFA production, as well as the relative abundance of Akkermansia and other health‐promoting taxa such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Faecalibacterium. 79 On the other hand, other in vivo studies have found a negative association between the gut microbiome and the bioavailability of vitamin E. For instance, Ran et al. reported an increase in the absorption rate of vitamin E after antibiotic treatment in a mouse model, suggesting vitamin degradation by intestinal commensals. 80

The aforementioned literature on the bidirectional gut microbiome–micronutrient axis strongly suggests that personalized microbiome‐based interventions could be a promising tool for improving host micronutrient status. Tailored interventions aimed at restoring/maintaining a eubiotic microbiome profile, capable of producing vitamins and SCFAs while being low in lipopolysaccharides, could be instrumental to ensure adequate biosynthesis and absorption of micronutrients, for optimal bioavailability for the host. For instance, prebiotic galactooligosaccharides mitigated the adverse effects of iron supplementation on the infant gut, 81 while the administration of L. reuteri in combination with the laxative magnesium oxide ameliorated chronic constipation in children without causing imbalances in the microbiome. 82

Further clinical studies that integrate multiomics approaches are needed to identify the bacterial species involved and assess their actual contribution to the micronutrient balance, hence their role in preventing and/or ameliorating any deficiencies. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying the relationship between our microbial counterpart and micronutrient bioavailability, postbiotic strategies could also be developed to broaden the range of precision personalized interventions aimed at tackling micronutrient deficiencies and related disorders.

The gut microbiome can variously influence the bioavailability of micronutrients, as well as be influenced by micronutrient supplementation, with implications for health even in the long term. Although several mechanisms have been advanced, a thorough characterization of the microbiome–micronutrient bidirectional axis is of utmost importance, as it can guide the design of microbiome‐based precision intervention strategies, aimed at improving micronutrient status and overall health.
