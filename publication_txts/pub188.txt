Metagenomic profiles of the early life microbiome of Indonesian inpatient neonates and their influence on clinical characteristics

Determining the initial normal neonatal gut microbiome is challenging. The debate regarding the sterile fetal environment is still ongoing. Therefore, studying and comparing normal and dysbiotic microbiomes requires the elucidation of both the fetal and infant microbiomes. Factors influencing the normal microbiome also include regional and genetic factors specific to different countries. Determining the normal microbiome population in our center and their association with the clinical conditions of infants is helpful as a tool for both the prevention and treatment of related diseases during neonatal care. Here, we employed metagenomic sequencing to characterize meconium and the subsequent early-life gut microbiome of preterm neonates in Jakarta, Indonesia. Microbiome diversity and complexity was higher in the meconium and on day 4 than on day 7. At the genus level, the most abundant genus overall was unidentified Enterobacteriaceae, with meconium samples dominated by Ureaplasma, day 4 fecal samples dominated by Staphylococcus, and day 7 samples dominated by Clostridiales, while at the phylum level the most abundant was Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Perinatal factors of PROM and mother’s diet influenced the meconium microbiome, while day 4 and day 7 microbiome was associated with bacteremia and early administration of antibiotics. One of our sample sets was derived from triplets, and they had varying diversity despite being triplets. These data are valuable for understanding the formation of a healthy microbiome specific to neonates and devising a strategy to improve both the gut health and related clinical outcomes of the neonate.

Understanding the fetal microbiome and the interaction between diseases of newborns and their subsequent gut microbiome is promising as both a diagnostic and therapeutic instrument1,2. To date, knowledge regarding this field remains insufficient3. For many years, the fetus and the intrauterine environment have been known to be sterile, with the earliest microbial exposure and colonization occurring during delivery, promptly resulting in acquisition of maternal and environmental bacteria4. The microbiome initially has low diversity and low complexity and eventually develops and reaches a mature and enduring state after 2–3 years of age1,4,5.

We studied the meconium and fecal samples of preterm infants from a referral center hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia, applying next-generation sequencing (NGS); prior to this study, we applied a culture-based method to first map the microbiome of our hospital’s infants. Our aim is to characterize the early life fecal microbiome and to determine their extent of influences towards the neonates’ clinical conditions. Herein, we demonstrated the effect of clinical and environmental factors on meconium and the subsequent day 4 and day 7 fecal microbiome and their associations with clinical outcomes in the NICU.

This prospective cohort observational study included eight inpatient neonates born from February to June 2020 at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (CMH), Jakarta (Indonesia). Fecal samples, i.e., the meconium and the day 4 and day 7 fecal samples, were collected by CMH-trained laboratory personnel from all neonates.

All experimental protocols were approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects’ legal guardian(s).

The DNA from meconium samples and fecal samples was prepared on the same day after collection and treated to obtain the optimum yield of high-quality DNA for the NGS process. This step was carried out as elaborated by Rulita et al.15.

Amplification of the V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA (16S) gene using the specific primers forward 515F and reverse 806R and subsequent NGS were carried out by Novogen Co., China.

To analyze the 16S rRNA gene sequences, bioinformatic analysis was performed by Novogen Co., China, as follows.

Paired-end reads were assigned to samples based on their unique barcodes and truncated by trimming the barcode and primer sequences. Paired-end reads were merged using FLASH (version 1.2.7)16 (for details, see http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/FLASH). Quality filtering of the raw tags was performed under specific filtering conditions to obtain high-quality clean tags17 according to the QIIME (version 1.7.0)18 (for details, see http://qiime.org/scripts/split_libraries_fastq.html) quality control (QC) process.

The tags were compared with the reference database (Gold database, for details, see http://drive5.com/uchime/uchime_download.html) using the UCHIME algorithm (for details, see http://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual/uchime_algo.html)19 to detect chimera sequences (for details, see https://drive5.com/usearch/manual/chimeras.html); the chimera sequences were then removed20. Finally, the effective tags were obtained.

Analysis of species diversity based on the sequencing data was performed by Uparse software (Uparse version 7.0.1001, for details, see http://drive5.com/uparse/)21 using all the effective tags. Sequences with ≥ 97% similarity were assigned to the same operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Representative sequences for each OTU were screened for further annotation. For each representative sequence, Mothur software was used with the SSUrRNA database of the SILVA Database (for details, see http://www.arb-silva.de/)22 for species annotation at each taxonomic rank (threshold: 0.8–1)23 (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species).

In addition, based on the OTU clustering results, we performed multiple sequence alignments and established phylogenetic trees. The differences between subjects’ fecal samples or among groups regarding the structure of the microbial community were explained via dimension reduction (principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), principal component analysis (PCA), and NMDS) and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA). Statistical methods such as T-test, MetaStat, LEfSe, analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), and multiple response permutation procedure (MRPP) were used to test the significance of the microbial community structure differences among groups. Moreover, the results were subjected to canonical correlation analysis (CCA)/redundancy analysis (RDA) to explore the major environmental factors.

To analyze the complexity of the biodiversity of the microbiome, we determined the alpha diversity for a sample through calculation of several indices, including the observed species, Chao1, and Shannon indices. All these indices were calculated with QIIME (version 1.7.0) and displayed with R software (version 2.15.3)25.

MetaStat analysis was conducted by R software25. The P-value was calculated by the permutation test method, while the q-value was calculated by the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate method26. ANOSIM, MRPP and Adonis were performed by R software (Vegan package: the ANOSIM function, MRPP function and adonis function, respectively)25. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was calculated by Mothur using the AMOVA function. T-tests and drawing were conducted by R software25.

Each step, such as sample testing, PCR, purification, library preparation and sequencing, affect the quality and quantity of data, while the data quality directly affects the subsequent information analysis results. To maintain the accuracy and reliability of sequencing data, QC was performed at each step of the procedure.

In our study, there were only limited samples (24 DNA samples obtained from 8 subjects) for NGS profiling; thus, statistical bias was possible.

All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. We confirm that all experimental protocols were approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia.

We confirm that informed consent was obtained from all subjects’ legal guardian(s).

All subjects were preterm inpatient neonates born in CMH, Jakarta. All fecal samples were collected from those eight subjects by performing the same procedure at three time points, i.e., meconium (24–48 h) and feces on day 4 and day 7, providing 24 samples. The subjects consisted of an equal number of male and female neonates who were late preterm and very preterm neonates, with gestational ages ranging from 30 to 34 weeks and birth weights ranging from 1080 to 1900 g. All subjects were born via C-section, except one born spontaneously; subject AJM. The frequencies of the feeding patterns breast milk only and mixed feeding were almost equal (5–3, respectively). There were more neonates who did not receive antibiotics than those who did, while during pregnancy, only two out of 8 subjects’ mothers received antibiotics. Total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels were all within the normal limit. These characteristics are shown in Table
1.

We also collected the dietary records of the mothers and found that the overall dietary pattern lacked dairy intake. The complete dietary pattern of the mothers is summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

In the process of constructing OTUs for studying the microbial community composition, basic information about different samples was collected, such as effective tag data, low-frequency tag data and tag annotation data. A summary of this information is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Taxonomic annotation for the 50 highest abundance OTUs in every time-point group is summarized in Table
2. The complete OTU taxonomic annotation at the species level of all time-point groups is summarized in Supplementary Table 2.

The richness and evenness information about the microbiome diversity across three time-point groups, and common and unique OTU information among different groups were obtained by using alpha diversity assessment. This measure allowed us to assess a broader change or difference in the composition of microorganisms for describing the microbiome. Based on alpha diversity assessments data performed, i.e., observed species, Shannon diversity, and chao1 diversity, as well as Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity across three-time points groups (meconium, day 4 and day 7) as presented in Fig. 2, significantly different composition of microorganisms for describing the microbiome between groups was not observed. It demonstrated that the pattern of early life microbiome development exhibited similar species richness and evenness in three-time points groups, although with some exceptions for unhealthy neonates represented by outliers’ value.

We produced alpha rarefaction curves to indicate whether the biodiversity of microbiome samples reflects the representativeness of the sequencing data directly and reflects the richness of the microbial community in the samples indirectly. The curve flattened (Supplementary Fig. 11), indicating that a reliable number of samples was used, which means that only scarce species remained to be sampled.

Beta diversity measures were assessed to capture changes in microbiome community composition among the groups. The dissimilarity among groups was calculated with gradient analysis and displayed with ordination plots (PCA, PCoA, etc.). Samples with similar microbial community structures tended to cluster, and vice versa. Here, we used the PCoA method with weighted UniFrac and unweighted UniFrac distances and visualized the results as a graph, as shown in Fig. 3.

The development of the feces microbiome of the triplet subjects from meconium, day 4, and day 7 with their proportion is shown in Fig. 6.

This study shows the development and diversity of the gut microbiome in 24 samples derived from the feces samples of eight preterm neonates born at CMH, Jakarta, at 3 different time points in early life. The analysis of gut microbiome development over the first week based on alpha and beta diversity in terms of relative abundance showed that for the 8 subjects providing 24 feces samples at the three time points, i.e., meconium, day 4 feces, and day 7 feces, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were dominant at the phylum level, while at the genus level, unidentified Enterobacteriaceae were most abundant, as has been reported widely1,6,7,9,10,29–34. This result is similar to our previous study on cultivable bacteria from meconium from neonates born in CMH9. The microbiomes of meconium, as the first feces in this study, were relatively similar, with one subject showing a high abundance of the genus Ureaplasma and the rest showing a high abundance of Enterobacter.

The limitation of our study, first and foremost, is the sample collection method. We were unable to collect fresh meconium samples to prevent contamination. The reason for this is that the method to obtain fresh meconium in preterm neonates requires administration of an anal spool using saline or glycerol. This technique is potentially harmful due to the nature of preterm gastrointestinal function in which peristaltic movement is usually delayed; therefore, collecting the sample directly and not from the diapers is of utmost difficulty if not actively monitored. The results were still within acceptable limits, whereas contamination would yield lower abundance from the DNA sequencing and would still yield a positive result, but the most dominant genus would still not be from the contamination source. Our second limitation is the small number of samples. We originally opted to collect more samples; however, this work serves as a preliminary study on how the microbiome of preterm neonates in our center is established. We deem the results of the metagenomic analysis to be acceptable for use as the basis for future studies.

A myriad of factors influences the development of the neonatal gut microbiome, including maternal, perinatal, and postnatal factors. Indonesian pregnant women have markedly low consumption of dairy products, which results in decreased populations of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. The most abundant genus was unidentified Enterobacteriaceae, with slight variations in specific samples dominated by Clostridiales and Ureaplasma, and Proteobacteria and Firmicutes showed dominance at the phylum level. Perinatal factors showed influence on the meconium microbiome including PROM and mother’s diet, in which populations of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus was not found, instead Ureaplasma was one of the dominant populations in the patient with mother’s history of PROM. Notable associations between early life fecal microbiome and clinical outcomes include administration of early antibiotics and bacteremia, with the ensuing microbiome population to show less diversity. The development of the preterm neonate gut microbiome from meconium to day 4 and day 7 showed a pattern of change in diversity as time progresses, but a similarity with the meconium microbiome was maintained, and with decreasing complexity. These data emphasize the need for specific evaluation and management of dysbiosis and their related clinical outcomes in different populations.
