Integrated microbiome and metabolome analysis reveals a novel interplay between commensal bacteria and metabolites in colorectal cancer

Rationale: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor with the third highest morbidity rate among all cancers. Driven by the host's genetic makeup and environmental exposures, the gut microbiome and its metabolites have been implicated as the causes and regulators of CRC pathogenesis. We assessed human fecal samples as noninvasive and unbiased surrogates to catalog the gut microbiota and metabolome in patients with CRC.

Conclusions: Our results provide substantial evidence of a novel interplay between the gut microbiome and metabolome (i.e., polyamines), which is drastically perturbed in CRC. Microbe-associated metabolites can be used as diagnostic biomarkers in therapeutic explorations.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) carries the third highest burden of morbidity among all malignant tumors worldwide 1, 2. Although several mechanistic events have been identified that play key roles during colorectal carcinogenesis, only a few of these molecular targets are clinically translatable 3. Identification of previously unrecognized mechanism(s) that drive cancer development would be of clinical relevance as these would allow development of robust biomarkers and effective drug targets, which are urgently needed for the diagnosis and therapeutic management of CRC. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in the occurrence and development of CRC are far from being explored.

Although there are several studies that have reported microbial associations with CRC, the profile of the gut microbial community and its functional contribution to CRC has not been systematically characterized 9. Moreover, it is now clear that some important factors that connect intestinal microbiota to CRC are microbial metabolites 10. As biochemical converters, gut microbes are capable of converting the complex chemical space presented by the dietary and host nutrients into a milieu of metabolites 11. These metabolites can exert either genotoxic or tumor-suppressive functions through multiple mechanisms, such as by providing supportive metabolic flux to promote anabolic metabolism, by acting as competitive enzyme inhibitors, or by modifying signaling proteins 12. Therefore, the disruption in the balance of metabolites by the microbiome may result in tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, the interplay between gut microbiota and metabolites and their roles in CRC development have not been effectively addressed, and the study of this interplay is limited by invasive and expensive sampling techniques that are often biased with unidimensional classical approaches. Thus, taking advantage of this critical gap in the literature, we envisaged this study to systematically and comprehensively interrogate the microbiome and metabolome of human CRC fecal samples, to identify microbial diversity and metabolite abundance and to decipher the association of CRC with gut microbiota and fecal metabolites.

A total of 50 patients diagnosed with sporadic CRC and 50 healthy (H) volunteers for conventional medical examination including fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and fibrocolonoscopy examination evaluated at Tongji University Affiliated Tenth People's Hospital (Shanghai, China) from January 2014 to September 2014 were recruited for inclusion in this study. The written informed consents were obtained from the CRC patients and the H volunteers. Their general clinical data including age, gender, educational background, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and histories of smoking, hypertension, appendectomy, and FOBT were recorded. All patients and volunteers were Shanghai Han Chinese with similar geographic areas and eating habits. All patients were diagnosed by postoperative pathological examinations. The clinical pathological features of CRC, such as tumor stage, tumor location, tumor size, tumor differentiation, serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), were recorded. The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients older than 80 years or younger than 25 years; patients with a history of familial CRC, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); individuals who received preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy; patients with other coexisting malignant tumors; and patients with complications of complete intestinal obstruction. All the H volunteers had a normal bowel habit. The H volunteers had no history of IBS, IBD, CRC, other malignant tumors or other severe gastroenterological diseases. All patients and volunteers using antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics within two months of sampling were excluded. The flow chart displaying the enrollment and analysis process is illustrated in Supplementary Figure S1. Three H volunteers with a positive FOBT were further detected by fiber electron colonoscopy and confirmed to have stage I internal hemorrhoids without neoplasia throughout the entire large intestine, thus, the 3 H volunteers were included in our study. Four volunteers with colon polyps were excluded in our further study after colonic endoscopy. All qualified stool samples were self-sampled prior to mechanical bowel preparation and were transported immediately to the laboratory, divided into two portions per sample, packed into two frozen pipes, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen overnight and preserved under -80°C for further testing. Our studies were conducted under the institutional review board (IRB) protocols of the participating institutions.

The genomic DNA of feces was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. DNA integrity and size were verified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA concentrations were determined using NanoDrop spectrophotometry (NanoDrop, Germany).

16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-based amplification was performed using the primers (319F: 5'-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3'; 806R: 5'-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3') directionally targeting the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. To differentiate each sequenced sample and obtain accurate phylogenetic and taxonomic information, the gene products were attached with forward and reverse error-correcting barcodes. After purification, the amplicons were quantified, following which the normalized equimolar concentrations of amplicons were pooled and sequenced on a MiSeq PE300 sequencing instrument (Illumina, Inc., CA, USA) using 2 ×300 bp chemistry according to the manufacturer's specifications.

The paired-end reads were generated and assigned to each sample based on their barcodes and then were merged with FLASH (Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads) software. High-quality filtering of the raw tags was conducted to acquire clean tags using Qiime (Version 1.7.0) 13. The chimeric sequences were filtered using Usearch (Uparse v6.0.307) software. Sequences with more than 97% similarity thresholds were allocated to one operational taxonomic unit (OTU) using CD-HIT (v4.6.1). Classification of representative sequences for each OTU was applied, and then Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier 2.10.1 were used to assign taxonomic data to each sequence. The phylogenetic differences in the dominant OTUs were performed using Python Nearest Alignment Space Termination (PyNAST). A rarefaction curve was generated using the Mothur package for richness estimations of the OTUs. Alpha diversity was performed to identify the complexity of species diversity for each sample. To assess the diversity in samples for species complexity, beta diversity calculations were analyzed by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Welch's t-test were used to compare bacterial abundance and diversity. Heat maps were constructed based on the nonparametric Wilcoxon test (p < 0.05, q < 0.1) at the genus level. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) coupled with effect size (LEfSe) was applied to evaluate the differentially abundant taxon.

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed as described 14. Briefly, lyophilized fecal samples (100 mg) were collected in 5 mL centrifuge tubes, and ddH2O (500 µL at 4°C) was added. The mixture was then vortexed for 1 min. Then, 1 mL methanol (-20°C) was used for extraction, following addition of 30 μL 2-chloro-L-phenylalanine (0.2 mg/mL) and 60 μL heptadecanoic acid (0.05 mg/mL) as internal standards. The mixture was vortexed for 30 s and sonicated for 10 min, kept on ice for 30 min, and subsequently centrifuged at 14000 rpm at 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant (1200 μL) was transferred into a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube and freeze-dried with nitrogen. Methoxyamination was performed by adding 60 μL methoxyamine. HCl solution (20 mg/mL in pyridine) was added to each tube, followed by incubation and shaking at 1200 rpm for 120 min at 37°C. Then, 60 μL N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) was added into the mixture and then incubated at 37°C for 90 min for trimethylsilyl derivatization. Pooled samples were used as quality control (QC) samples over batches of 10 samples, and samples were blinded and randomized and were served as QC checks by injecting at scheduled intervals for monitoring shifts in retention indices (RI). Deionized water was used as the control sample to account for the background noise produced during sample processing and data analysis.

Samples were analyzed with an Agilent Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometer (7890A/5975C GC-MS System, Agilent, CA, USA). The GC system employed a HP-5MS capillary column coated with 5% phenyl methyl silox (Agilent J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA). Samples (1 μL) were injected at a split ratio of 20:1. As a carrier gas, helium was set to a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The temperatures were set to 280°C (injection), 250°C (transfer line) and 150°C (ion source), respectively. The initial temperature program was set at 2 min of isothermal heating at 70°C and then increased to 300°C at a rate of 10°C/min. The final temperature was maintained for 5 min. Electron impact ionization (70 eV) in a full scan mode with an m/z range of 35-780 was used for data acquisition.

The GC-MS data obtained in [.D] format from the platform were converted to .mzXML format using msConvert (ProteoWizard tool) and were preprocessed, cleaned, deconvoluted and aligned using the Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS, National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA) interface to match against the freely available Mass Spectral (MS) and Retention Time Index (RI) (MSRI) library at the Golm Metabolome Database. Metabolites were further identified by comparing fragmentation patterns available in both the Golm database and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Mass Spectral Reference Library 2011 (NIST11/2011; National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA). Peak findings and quantification of selective ion traces were accomplished using AMDIS software. As a rule, if a compound had an AMDIS match factor > 60%, a probability score > 20% and a matching RI to a known compound, it was considered “probable”. Base peak areas of the mass fragments (m/z) were normalized using median normalization and log2 transformation.

Fecal metabolomes were obtained, of which a total of 12 outliers were detected postanalysis and were removed, possibly due to other sources of unwanted source of variations. Thus, we obtained fecal metabolome data from 42 H volunteers and 46 CRC patients. Normalized, transformed, imputed, outlier removed, and scaled peak areas representative of relative metabolite abundances obtained by processing using the DeviumWeb package (https://github.com/dgrapov/DeviumWeb) are presented in the tables and figures. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) was applied on Pearson distances using PermutMatrix 15. For heat-maps, the fecal metabolome data were normalized using z-scores under the peak areas. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted at DeviumWeb, where output consisted of score plots to visualize the contrast between sample set and loading plot to interpret cluster separation. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was applied to highlight the phenotypic difference between the groups used in the study. Pathway enrichment was conducted at MetaboAnalyst. For ID conversions, a web tool-Chemical Translation Service (CTS) was utilized to convert the common compound into Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) metabolite IDs.

Significant differences in clinical characteristics were evaluated with Pearson's Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Pearson's rank correlation analysis was conducted to calculate the correlation between metabolites or between species and metabolites. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Two-tailed Student's t-test was performed and the p-value was adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction. The probability level for statistical tests was set at α = 0.05 and was adjusted by the BH correction to allow for a maximum 5% probability (q = 0.05) of false positive detection. All data were analyzed with Graph Pad Prism 6 software (GraphPad software, Inc., San Diego, California, USA), R version 3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA).

All patients and volunteers were Han Chinese from Shanghai area with comparable eating habits to exclude dietary differences. The clinicopathological variables (Supplementary Table 1) of the two groups were generally matched, suggesting that none of the established confounding factors influenced group discrimination prior to the experimental design and sample collection. There was a significant difference in positive FOBT results between the CRC and H groups (44% versus 6%, p < 0.001).

In our present microbiome investigation, a total number of 3087931 high-quality 16S rRNA reads were obtained, with a median read count of 29099.5 (range, 17816 to 49391) per sample. Following taxonomic assignment, 1084 OTUs were obtained (Supplementary Table S2). The species accumulation curve (Supplementary Figure S2A) and the rarefaction curve (Supplementary Figure S2B) of all samples supported the adequacy of the sampling efforts. In addition, the rank abundance distribution curves (Supplementary Figure S2C) indicated decreased richness and a relative bacterial imbalance in the CRC group compared with the H group.

To evaluate the differences in bacterial diversity between the two groups, sequences were aligned to estimate alpha diversity and beta diversity. There were statistically significant differences in the Shannon (3.73 ± 1.39 versus 4.35 ± 0.90, p = 0.0093), observed species (204.56 ± 98.32 versus 257.46 ± 64.61 p = 0.002), and Chao1 (273.70 ± 127.98 versus 333.81 ± 79.63, p = 0.0058) indexes, whereas the Simpson index (0.76 ± 0.23 versus 0.85 ± 0.09, p = 0.0758) was not significantly different between the CRC and H groups (Figure
1A). Both the unweighted and the weighted PCoA plots revealed a separation of the two groups on the basis of the first three PCoA (Figure
1B). These results suggest that the diversity of gut microbiota could be strongly influenced by the tumor burden.

The relative proportions of dominant taxa at the phylum level were assessed by microbial taxon assignment in both groups. We observed considerable variability in gut microbiota across samples in each group (Figure
1C). Twelve phyla were identified in each group. Bacteroidetes was the most predominant phylum, accounting for 46.8% and 46.9% of the OTUs in the CRC and H groups, respectively. In addition, Proteobacteria (23.9% versus 7.2%) and Fusobacteria (6.6% versus 0.1%) were enriched in the CRC group compared to the H group, whereas Firmicutes (20.8% versus 43.5%) was enriched in the H group. Although an upregulated Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio has been suggested as an indicator of several pathological conditions 16, our results suggested otherwise (Supplementary Figure S2D).

Considering that this discriminant analysis did not distinguish the predominant taxon, LEfSe was used to generate a cladogram to identify the specific bacteria associated with CRC (Figure
2). We identified 76 discriminatory OTUs as key discriminants. Several opportunistic pathogens including Gammaproteobacteria (Proteobacteria), Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacteriales), and Fusobacteriales (Fusobacteria) were all significantly overrepresented (all LDA scores (log10) > 4) in the feces of patients in the CRC group, whereas Firmicutes, Clostridiales, Clostridia, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Selenomonadales, Negativicutes, and Faecalibacterium were the most abundant microbiota in the H group (LDA scores (log10) > 3.6). The relative abundances of these 76 OTUs were further analyzed by clustering analysis represented by a heat map (Figure
3). The H group was enriched with 58 OTUs, while the CRC group was enriched with 18 OTUs (Supplementary Table S3). These data suggest that the abundance of microbes was much less in the CRC group than in the H group, and these differentially abundant microbiota were sufficient to differentiate the microbiota of H volunteers and CRC patients.

Since the CRC patients demonstrated signature microbiota associated with disease, we hypothesized that alterations in metabolic pathways may be at least partially affected by gut microbiota in patients with CRC. Therefore, we subsequently performed metabolome analysis of fecal samples using a nontargeted GC-MS-based metabolomics approach. We successfully quantified 226 metabolites in both the H and CRC groups, of which 164 were shared (Supplementary Table S4). These metabolites were mapped onto ~40 different KEGG metabolic pathways including protein biosynthesis (14 metabolites), ammonia recycling (5), and galactose metabolism (6) (Supplementary Figure S4A).

Analysis of the differentially accumulated and significantly changed metabolites in the H and CRC groups are shown in Supplementary Table S5. In the H group, the abundant metabolites were mainly sugars (maltose, fructose), sugar alcohols, amines (galactosamine) and a large set of organic and fatty acids (glycerol, octadecanoic acid, hexanedioic acid, benezenepropanoic acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid). In contrast, the CRC group showed a higher abundance of polyamines (cadaverine, 1,4-Butanediamine), amino acids (Pro, Glu) and urea, suggesting that the H group is better able to maintain carbohydrate metabolism and a more reductive environment in the gut than in the CRC group (Supplementary Table S6, Figure
4A).

More importantly, we found several metabolites that were uniquely present in either the CRC or H groups. For instance, 17 metabolites that potentially participate in Asp metabolism, ammonia recycling, protein biosynthesis, and Trp metabolism, which supports the environment needed for tumorigenesis (Figure
4B), were only quantified in the CRC group, i.e., Lys, heptanedioic acid (a precursor of Lys), norvaline, and several amino acid and organic acid derivatives (Supplementary Table S7). We also found 42 metabolites (excluding 20 unknown metabolites) that were not detectable in the CRC group at all. These metabolites are mostly involved in Asp metabolism, Ala metabolism, protein biosynthesis, etc. (Figure
4C), suggesting that these metabolic pathways are less active in CRC patients.

We further performed HCA analysis on the metabolite abundances in the H and CRC groups. The results displayed the following three large clusters: (i) sugars and fatty acids, which showed higher abundances in the H group than in the CRC group, and (ii) amino acids and (iii) polyamines, drugs and other metabolites, which showed higher abundances in the CRC group than in the H group (Figure
5A). Consistent with these findings, a metabolite-metabolite Pearson correlation analysis also showed a significant correlation between the abovementioned metabolites and the CRC phenotype (Supplementary Figure 4B, Supplementary Table S8). Specifically, higher abundances of sugars and sugar alcohols, such as fructose, iditol, sedoheptulose, maltose, glycerol, galactosamine, and fatty acids, such as 9, 12-octadecanoic acid, oleic acid, hexanedioic acid, and pentanedioic acid, were observed in the H group. Amino acids, such as Phe, Pro, Ala, Lys, 5-oxo-Pro, Val, Leu, and Orn, were also overrepresented in the CRC group. PCA clearly showed differences between the H and CRC groups based on the first two principal components, PC1 (6%) and PC2 (4%), suggesting CRC group-specific metabolomic abundance and signatures (Figure
5B). These claims were further supported by OPLS-DA analysis, where several specific metabolites such as cadaverine, Pro, Ala, 1,4-butanedioic acid, urea, Val, Lys, Leu, glycerol, Ile, 5-oxo-Pro, benzenepropanoic acid (i.e., hydrocinnamic acid), Phe, sedoheptulose and Tyr, were able to differentiate CRC patients from H volunteers (Figure
5C). Taken together, our data clearly and robustly showed that CRC patients presented a specific fecal metabolome.

Based on the above fecal microbiome and metabolomics data, we performed Pearson's correlation-based clustering analysis to identify microbe-associated metabolites in CRC (Figure
6A). Interestingly, we observed that the metabolite-microbe correlation was stronger in CRC patients (Supplementary Table S9) than in H volunteers (Supplementary Table S10), suggesting that the aberrantly enriched metabolites in CRC are highly attributed to an imbalance in gut microflora or to interactions thereof. Notably, these data only suggest a potential correlation between gut microbes and metabolites without considering the different bacterial abundances between the two groups or the dietary habits of the subjects. We further explored the 76-OTUs-associated metabolites (Supplementary Table S11). The results revealed positive correlations for several microbe-metabolite pairs in the CRC group (Figure
6B). Furthermore, several unknown metabolites that could not be identified by the currently available EI spectral libraries were also found to be significantly associated with several OTUs, indicating their potential roles as future targets for biomarker discovery in CRC patients, pending confident annotation.

According to this analysis, we focused on polyamines as potential biomarkers, as these were the abundant metabolites identified in the CRC group. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that cadaverine (area under the curve (AUC), 0.764; p = 5.4512E-5) and putrescine (AUC, 0.672; p = 0.015449) were significantly associated with CRC samples (Figure
6D). Thus, the diagnostic value of polyamines was equivalent to or better than that of FOBT (AUC, 0.681; p = 0.002), which is a conventional method for CRC screening.

Akin to an anaerobic bioreactor, the colorectum harbors an enormous diversity of microbiota, more than a trillion cells, which are capable of producing an extraordinarily wide range of small molecules (i.e., metabolites) that influence many vital pathways associated with energy homeostasis, nutritional intake, and immune balance 17. Additionally, accumulating evidence suggests that the microbiome and its metabolome contribute to tumorigenesis in CRC 18. Therefore, using the gut microbiome and its metabolites as screening tools for early detection of carcinoma is a promising field 19. Omics approaches show great promise for the development of biomarkers as they generate large scale data sets containing thousands of variables in a high-throughput manner that may be predictive and thus offer a lucrative approach when presented with a biological system with extremely high complexity, i.e., CRC disease diagnosis from fecal matter 19. Compared with omics approaches using biofluids, such as serum and urine, the fecal metabolome reflects direct interactions among genetic, environmental, and dietary factors 20. Thus, metabolomics research efforts involving fecal samples may be more effective at identifying biomarkers. Given that > 80% of fecal metabolites overlap with mucosal metabolites, only < 50% of CRC-specific metabolites can be found in feces, which poses a challenge in correlating CRC with fecal metabolite abundance 21. Thus, the global nontargeted metabolomics analysis applied herein on fecal sample provides insights into the association between bacterial populations from a microbiome sequencing approach and may allow identification of CRC-derived metabolic biomarkers.

Nonetheless, it is extremely challenging to evaluate fecal metabolites, a majority of which can be contributed by diet (and microbiota therein) and lifestyle, and to differentiate host-derived metabolites from those of the microbial metabolites without isotope-labeled diet studies, which are difficult to perform in human subjects. Moreover, without a controlled diet and for the simplicity of the study design, we could only associate metabolites with disease phenotypes at one timepoint in both groups. Additionally, the simple aqueous-methanolic sample extraction technique used failed to capture most of the nonpolar fatty acids, i.e., SCFAs, unconjugated secondary bile acids and other specialized metabolites and volatiles that are typically released by the gut microbiome and the host's gut cellular landscape 36. This study has some limitations but opens new avenues to explore the gut microbiome-metabolome associations for biomarker discovery.

We demonstrated the capabilities of a nontargeted GC-MS-based metabolomics approach to successfully discriminate between H and CRC volunteers and associated different metabolites with health status or disease phenotype. Furthermore, fecal microbiome data displayed the signature microbiota representing the H and CRC patient groups, i.e., enrichment of Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria in CRC and Firmicutes in H groups as well as an uneven and lesser microbial diversity in CRC. Given that all the patients were from a single ethnicity, i.e., Han Chinese, identifying specific biomarkers for CRC prediction in a global population may not be straightforward. However, polyamines (cadaverine, putrescine) in CRC are potential biomarkers for discriminating CRC versus H status, pending further validation studies across georacial landscapes in larger cohorts performed over a longer time. This integrated analysis of the putative microbial metabolism based on the identified microbes and fecal metabolites provides more functional insights than either of the single datasets. Nonetheless, individual metabolites, i.e., polyamines, and OTU differences among individuals are helpful in differentiating between CRC and H status.
