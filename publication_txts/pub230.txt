Interpretable Machine Learning Framework Reveals Robust Gut Microbiome Features Associated With Type 2 Diabetes

To identify the core gut microbial features associated with type 2 diabetes risk and potential demographic, adiposity, and dietary factors associated with these features.

We used an interpretable machine learning framework to identify the type 2 diabetes–related gut microbiome features in the cross-sectional analyses of three Chinese cohorts: one discovery cohort (n = 1,832, 270 cases of type 2 diabetes) and two validation cohorts (cohort 1: n = 203, 48 cases; cohort 2: n = 7,009, 608 cases). We constructed a microbiome risk score (MRS) with the identified features. We examined the prospective association of the MRS with glucose increment in 249 participants without type 2 diabetes and assessed the correlation between the MRS and host blood metabolites (n = 1,016). We transferred human fecal samples with different MRS levels to germ-free mice to confirm the MRS–type 2 diabetes relationship. We then examined the prospective association of demographic, adiposity, and dietary factors with the MRS (n = 1,832).

The MRS (including 14 microbial features) consistently associated with type 2 diabetes, with risk ratio for per 1-unit change in MRS 1.28 (95% CI 1.23–1.33), 1.23 (1.13–1.34), and 1.12 (1.06–1.18) across three cohorts. The MRS was positively associated with future glucose increment (P < 0.05) and was correlated with a variety of gut microbiota–derived blood metabolites. Animal study further confirmed the MRS–type 2 diabetes relationship. Body fat distribution was found to be a key factor modulating the gut microbiome–type 2 diabetes relationship.

Our results reveal a core set of gut microbiome features associated with type 2 diabetes risk and future glucose increment.

Type 2 diabetes is a complex disorder influenced by both host genetic and environmental factors (1), and its prevalence is rising rapidly in both developed and developing countries (2). Gut microbiome is considered as a modifiable environmental factor that plays an important role in the development of type 2 diabetes (3). The research interest in identification of gut microbiome–related treatment/prevention targets has recently emerged (4). Although there are a few human studies investigating the association of gut microbiome with type 2 diabetes in the past few years, the results are inconsistent (5). So far, there is sparse human evidence robustly linking specific gut microbiome features to type 2 diabetes.

Therefore, in the current study, we aimed to identify human gut microbiome features associated with type 2 diabetes using a novel interpretable machine learning analytical framework in large-scale human cohorts. We also assessed the correlation between the identified microbes and host blood metabolites to provide insight into the role of type 2 diabetes–related gut microbiota in host metabolism. We further performed a fecal microbiota transfer experiment to confirm the effect of the identified microbes on type 2 diabetes development. As a secondary objective, we aimed to identify potential adiposity, dietary, and lifestyle factors that could modify the type 2 diabetes–related gut microbiome using our longitudinal cohort data.

The overview of the study workflow is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. We included participants from three human cohorts, Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study (GNHS) (8) as a discovery cohort (n = 1,832, 270 type 2 diabetes cases), the control arm of a case-control study of hip fracture (n = 203, 48 cases) (9), and Guangdong Gut Microbiome Project (GGMP) (n = 7,009, 608 cases) (10) as two validation cohorts.

GGMP (10) was conducted between 2015 and 2016; 7,009 participants (608 case subjects, 530 fasting blood glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L) with measurement of 16S rRNA from stool samples were included in the current study. Type 2 diabetes ascertainment and stool collection were conducted at the same time point.

Microbial DNA extraction, PCR, and amplicon sequencing were performed as previously described (see Supplementary Material). FASTQ files were demultiplexed, merge paired, and quality filtered by QIIME (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology software (version 1.9.0) (12). Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units with 97% similarity and annotated based on the Greengenes Database (version 13.8) (13).

Detailed methods for the metadata measurements and shotgun metagenome sequencing are provided in Supplementary Material.

Metadata at the same point in time as the stool sample collection were used as the covariates. Characteristics for each cohort were shown in Table 1.

Data are means (SD) unless otherwise indicated. DBP, diastolic blood pressure, SBP, systolic blood pressure; TC, total cholesterol; TG, triglycerides.

We devised a model based on a gradient boosting framework—Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) (14), a gradient boosting decision tree algorithm—to link input features with type 2 diabetes. A total of 297 host features that were potentially related to type 2 diabetes in the literature (metadata, gut microbiota composition, and diversity [see Supplementary Material]) (15) were incorporated into our machine learning model. We also compared our model performance with other widely used methods such as logistic regression and random forest.

We used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) (7) to unlock the machine learning results. The mean absolute value of the SHAP values for each feature represents their average contribution to the overall model predictions. Thus, features with an average absolute SHAP value >0 were used as selected features. The inflection point of SHAP dependence plots (x-axis represents the feature variable, while y-axis represents the SHAP value for the feature variable) was defined as the optimal threshold for each selected feature.

We constructed a classifier based on the identified microbiota features, host genetics, and the traditional type 2 diabetes risk factors separately (see Supplementary Material), and compared their predictive performance. In addition, we excluded patients with prediabetes defined by the criteria from the World Health Organization (16) to reevaluate our microbiome-based classifier performance in the discovery cohort (302 participants with prediabetes) and validation cohort 1 (46 participants with prediabetes). We used DeLong’s test method to test the difference between the classifier’s predictive performance before and after exclusion of the patients with prediabetes. Our predictor is based on code adapted from sklearn 0.15.2 (17) LightGBM class; R package pROC (18) was used for receiver operating characteristic curve analyses, and the method of DeLong was used for area under the curve comparison.

We construct a microbiome risk score (MRS) based on the machine learning–selected microbiome features and their SHAP values (for formula, see Supplementary Material). We also constructed another MRS following the conventional method (19) and used a Poisson regression to test the cross-sectional association of the two constructed MRS models with type 2 diabetes risk, respectively.

Nine participants were randomly selected as the representative donors according to the level of the MRS (range 0–14). A detailed description of fecal suspension inoculum preparation and transplantation is provided in Supplementary Material.

The study protocols were approved by the local Ethical Review Committee, Guangzhou, China, and all human participants gave written informed consent.

Statistical analysis was performed with Stata 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). For the discovery cohort and external validation cohort 1, a multivariable Poisson regression model was used to examine the cross-sectional association with type 2 diabetes for MRS and each machine learning–identified taxa-related feature as a continuous variable or as a binary variable: higher abundance (i.e., at or above the optimal threshold) compared with lower abundance (i.e., below the optimal threshold), with adjustment for age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, household income, marital status, and self-reported educational level, total energy intake, alcohol drinking, and smoking. For external validation cohort 2, all aforementioned covariates except total energy intake (not available) were used in the statistical model. We combined the effect estimates from the three cohorts using random-effects meta-analysis. We repeated the above analysis in the discovery cohort using MRS derived from the same microbial features of metagenomic data to test the robustness of 16S results.

For the results of the animal study, ANOVA was used for comparison between multiple groups. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to control the false discovery rate. P values <0.05 were considered significant.

For the discovery and external validation cohort 1, the raw data for 16S rRNA gene sequences are available in CNGB Sequence Archive (CNSA) (https://db.cngb.org/cnsa/) of China National GeneBank (CNGBdb), accession number CNP0000829. For the external validation cohort 2, the raw data for 16S rRNA gene sequences are available from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/), ac‐cession number PRJEB18535.

LightGBM (14), used in the current study, outperformed the logistic regression and random forest in type 2 diabetes prediction (Supplementary Table 1). We identified 21 features that contributed to type 2 diabetes prediction, of which 15 were microbiome features (unweighted_nmds6 and observed_species were indicators of microbial diversity, and others were taxa-related features) (Supplementary Fig. 3). The 21 identified features showed a similar predictive capacity compared with all 297 input features (Supplementary Table 2), and the majority of the selected taxa-related features had a low-to-modest intercorrelation (Supplementary Fig. 4).

The MRS is generated based on 14 microbiome features, including 13 taxa and 1 microbial alpha-diversity index (i.e., observed species).

There was no significant interaction between MRS and age (Pinteraction = 0.8) or MRS and sex (Pinteraction = 0.3) for type 2 diabetes risk in the discovery cohort. Subgroup analysis for the MRS–type 2 diabetes relationship stratified by age and sex produced similar results (Supplementary Table 4).

Our results indicated that individuals age >66.7 years or with waist circumference >84.6 cm were at high risk of type 2 diabetes (Supplementary Fig. 6). This is consistent with the standards of medical care for type 2 diabetes in China (20,21), which suggests that individuals >65 years old or with waist circumference >85 cm (male) or 80 cm (female) are at high risk of type 2 diabetes.

We identified the optimal threshold of the identified 13 taxa-related features according to their SHAP dependence plots (Supplementary Table 5). Eight of 13 taxa-related features showed statistically significant associations with type 2 diabetes when they were treated as binary variables—high abundance (i.e., at or above the optimal threshold) compared with low abundance (i.e., below the optimal threshold) (Supplementary Fig. 7A)—while only 3 taxa-related features showed significant association with type 2 diabetes if the abundance of the selected microbiome was treated as a continuous variable (Supplementary Fig. 7B).

We conducted a prospective investigation among 249 participants with normal fasting glucose (fasting glucose <7 mmol/L) at baseline. The mean (SD) initial and end blood glucose level of this group was 5.2 (0.5) mmol/L and 5.4 (0.6) mmol/L, respectively. Our results showed that MRS was significantly positively associated (P < 0.05) with future glucose increments in two statistical models (Fig. 1C).

We performed targeted metabolomics profiling of serum samples from the discovery cohort (n = 903) and external validation 1 (n = 113) and assessed the correlation of the type 2 diabetes–related combination of microbes (i.e., MRS) with 199 serum metabolites. Participants with a history of type 2 diabetes medication use were excluded from this analysis. The serum samples were collected at the same point in time as the stool samples. We found that the MRS was consistently correlated with six metabolites in the discovery cohort and external validation cohort 1 (Fig. 1D).

The MRS was negatively correlated with 2-phenylpropionate, hydrocinnamic acid, and indole-3-propionic acid, which were all associated with gut microbiome metabolism (22–24). Deoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid glycine conjugate are secondary bile acids produced by the action of enzymes existing in the microbial flora of the colonic environment (25). Recent studies have revealed that alteration of gut microbiota not only could affect the bile acid pool but also could influence the bile acid receptor signaling (i.e., FXR and TGR5). The FXR has been reported to be involved in glucose homeostasis, energy expenditure, and lipid metabolism (26). These observations provide insight into the potential function and mechanism of our identified microbial features, represented by the MRS, in host metabolism.

There was no significant difference in basal fasting glucose among the four experimental groups (P = 0.11). Mice transplanted with the gut microbiota from high-MRS individuals, of either non–type 2 diabetes or type 2 diabetes status, showed a significant increase in fasting glucose levels compared with levels of the low-MRS individuals or germ-free control mice (Supplementary Fig. 8A–C). There was no significant difference in fasting glucose between the germ-free control group and the low-MRS group.

In the longitudinal analysis of the discovery cohort, baseline BMI was positively associated with the MRS, while hip circumference and tea drinking were inversely associated (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table 6).

Obesity is the most important risk factor for type 2 diabetes (27). As BMI and hip circumference are closely correlated with MRS in our study, we hypothesized that the relationship of gut microbiome with type 2 diabetes might be modulated by adiposity status. MRS (per 1-unit change in MRS) was positively associated (P < 0.05) with the distribution of trunk–to–limb fat ratio in the discovery cohort (β 0.007, 95% CI 0.0037–0.011) and external validation cohort 1 (β 0.015, 95% CI 0.0023–0.03) (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). We found a significant interaction between MRS and trunk–to–limb fat mass ratio for type 2 diabetes risk in the discovery cohort (Pinteraction = 0.012) and external validation cohort 1 (Pinteraction = 0.037), with adjustment for potential confounders (Fig. 2C). In the discovery cohort, adjusted RR (95% CI) of type 2 diabetes was 1 (reference), 1.83 (0.86–3.88), and 3.61 (1.81–7.18) for tertiles 1, 2, and 3 of trunk-to-limb fat mass ratio among individuals in the lowest MRS levels (MRS tertile 1). It was 4.5 (2.21–9.17), 6.14 (3.12–12.08), and 11.79 (6.28–22.16) among individuals in the highest MRS tertile. Similar interaction results were found in the external validation cohort 1 (Fig. 2C).

In the current study, we identify a robust combination of gut microbes associated with type 2 diabetes by integrating a cutting-edge interpretable machine learning framework with large-scale human cohort studies. The combination of gut microbes shows superior type 2 diabetes prediction accuracy compared with host genetics or traditional risk factors. Additionally, we construct a novel risk score for the gut microbiome and successfully replicate the MRS–type 2 diabetes association in another two independent cohorts. We then reveal that the MRS is correlated with a few gut microbiota–derived blood metabolites. The fecal microbiota transfer experiment further confirms the effect of the identified combination of microbes on type 2 diabetes development. Finally, we identify potential modulating factors that could modulate the type 2 diabetes–related microbiome features and demonstrate that the relationship between MRS and type 2 diabetes could be modified by body fat distribution.

In summary, we successfully integrated the cutting-edge interpretable machine learning framework and large-scale human cohort studies, identifying a core set of gut microbiome features and their thresholds robustly associated with type 2 diabetes. The newly discovered combination of microbes can potentially be used as type 2 diabetes diagnostic, therapeutic, or preventive targets through diet and lifestyle intervention.
