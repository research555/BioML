The gut microbiome in human health and disease—Where are we and where are we going? A bibliometric analysis



There are trillions of microbiota in our intestinal tract, and they play a significant role in health and disease via interacting with the host in metabolic, immune, neural, and endocrine pathways. Over the past decades, numerous studies have been published in the field of gut microbiome and disease. Although there are narrative reviews of gut microbiome and certain diseases, the whole field is lack of systematic and quantitative analysis. Therefore, we outline research status of the gut microbiome and disease, and present insights into developments and characteristics of this field to provide a holistic grasp and future research directions.

An advanced search was carried out in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), basing on the term “gut microbiome” and its synonyms. The current status and developing trends of this scientific domain were evaluated by bibliometric methodology. CiteSpace was used to perform collaboration network analysis, co-citation analysis and citation burst detection.

A total of 29,870 articles and 13,311 reviews were retrieved from the database, which involve 42,900 keywords, 176 countries/regions, 19,065 institutions, 147,225 authors and 4,251 journals. The gut microbiome and disease research is active and has received increasing attention. Co-cited reference analysis revealed the landmark articles in the field. The United States had the largest number of publications and close cooperation with other countries. The current research mainly focuses on gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), while extra-intestinal diseases are also rising, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease. Omics technologies, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and metabolites linked to mechanism would be more concerned in the future.

The gut microbiome and disease has been a booming field of research, and the trend is expected to continue. Overall, this research field shows a multitude of challenges and great opportunities.

The human gut microbiota originated from colonization by environmental microbes during birth, and live in symbiosis with the host throughout life (Koenig et al., 2011; Kundu et al., 2017). The inoculum source usually and mainly is the mother’s vaginal and fecal microbiomes (Koenig et al., 2011). Human microbiota carried diverse set of genomes, and is considered as human second genome (Grice and Segre, 2012). While the microbes that reside in our gut account for the vast majority, present more than 1,000 species (Almeida et al., 2019), and the number of microorganisms is estimated up to trillions (Sender et al., 2016). These abundant and diverse gut microbes constitute a dynamic and complex ecosystem and perform various functions that are essential for the human host (Heintz-Buschart and Wilmes, 2018). On the one hand, there are competition and cooperation within these microbial consortia (Coyte and Rakoff-Nahoum, 2019), on the other hand, they also interact with the host in multiple aspects, including digestion and metabolism (Krautkramer et al., 2021), immune system (Rooks and Garrett, 2016) and unconscious system (Dinan and Cryan, 2017). Hence, the gut microbiome directly or indirectly impacts the host’s health.

Currently, the volume of scientific literatures about the gut microbiome and disease presents exponential growth. Although there are narrative reviews of gut microbiome and a specific disease, the entire research filed of the gut microbiome and disease is still lack of systematic and quantitative analysis. It is essential to outline this research domain to provide relevant scholars a ready and holistic grasp. Bibliometrics is a multidisciplinary discipline of quantitative analysis of all knowledge carriers by mathematical and statistical methods (Yu et al., 2018). The number and citations of academic publications can reflect the knowledge structure and development features of a scientific domain. Bibliometric analysis is beneficial for identifying and mapping the cumulative scientific knowledge and evolutionary nuances of scientific fields (Donthu et al., 2021). Bibliometrics has been widely used in many other fields, such as economic management, information science, energy and environment (Yu et al., 2020b). Therefore, we profile the research landscape of gut microbiome and disease with bibliometric methodology, to provide historical context and detect hot topics and emerging areas in this field. Furthermore, future evolutionary paths and challenges in this field are discussed.

Data were retrieved by an advanced search from the WoSCC of Clarivate Analytics,1 a curated collection of high-quality academic material on the Web of Science™ platform generally used for literature search, journal selection, research evaluation and bibliometric analysis (Li et al., 2018). To avoid bias due to daily updates of the database, document retrieval and export were performed within a single day (May 1, 2022). In order to include as far as possible relevant publications, synonyms for the gut microbiota and disease were included in the search strategy, and the boolean search was set to TS = [(gut* OR intestin* OR gastrointestin* OR gastro-intestin*) AND (microbiota OR microbiome OR flora OR microflora OR bacteria OR microbe* OR microorganism*)] AND TS = (disease*). The time span of publications was set as 1985-01-01 to 2021-12-31. The full record and cited references of the retrieved documents were saved for further analysis. The workflow of the study was presented in Supplementary Figure 1.

Given that original research is considered as primary literature and presents new knowledge to a certain research area, the “Articles” type of documents was used to evaluate the trends and hotspots of the gut microbiome and disease research. Citespace (Chen et al., 2012; v5.8.R3) was used to analyze reference co-citation, keyword co-occurrence, keywords burst and cooperation relationships among countries, institutions and authors. The Gephi (Bastian et al., 2009; v.0.9.2) was used to construct network graphs.

A total of 45,207 academic publications were retrieved from WoSCC, and publication years were distributed from 1996 to 2021. Among these publications, articles account for 66.074% (29,870 records), reviews account for 29.445% (13,311 records), other document types and their percentages see Supplementary Table 1. The overall output of publications has increased approximately exponentially for the last two decades (Figure 1A). Most of the studies were reported in the recent 15 years (n = 27,558, 92.260%). A turning point can be observed around 2007 (Figures 1B,
C), since that, the number of publications has been rising drastically. This is partially because of the invention of next-generation sequencing technologies. Other important reasons are the completion of the Human Genome Project (HGP) the launch of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and the Metagenomics of The Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT). The number of articles supported by fund(s), funding agencies, and funding projects has also been increasing for 26 years (Figures 1C,
D), and the percentage of articles supported by fund(s) has been up to 80% in recent 5 years. These results reveal that the gut microbiome and disease research is active and has received increasing attention.

A variety of web of science categories (174/254) are involved in these published articles (29,870), and the number was gradually ascending to 130 in 2021 (Supplementary Figure 2A), which suggests that the scientific field presents interdisciplinary characteristics (Supplementary Figures 3, 4A–D). The top 10 subject categories are Microbiology, Immunology, Multidisciplinary Sciences, Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Nutrition & Dietetics, Food Science & Technology, Pharmacology & Pharmacy and Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology, and the co-occurrence network of subject categories in the recent 5 years is shown in Supplementary Figure 2B. This research area shows tight relationships with medicine, immunology and nutrition besides microbiology (Supplementary Figures 2C, 5). There is remarkable growth in the number of articles related to cancer and the nerve system every year (Supplementary Figures 2D, 5).

The top 200 out of 33,664 keywords by frequency in 1996–2021 were used to construct heatmaps. These keywords were classified into nine categories, including “Definition,” “Technology,” “Experimental subjects” (Supplementary Figure 6), “Diseases/Conditions,” “Immunity,” “Mechanism,” “Metabolism,” “Intervention,” and “Microbes” (Figure 2). Description about this scientific area shifts gradually from “microflora” to “microbiota” and “microbiome” (Supplementary Figure 6A). A technological transition from PCR to sequencing and omics technologies is detected (Supplementary Figure 6B). The primary research subjects include “child,” “infant,” “pregnancy,” and “mice” (Supplementary Figure 6C).

The top 5 burst keywords related to disease with the highest burst strength are “Crohn’s disease,” “dysbiosis,” “atopic disease,” “ulcerative colitis,” and “Parkinson’s disease.” “Intestinal inflammation” has the longest burst duration (1998–2018) followed by “Crohn’s disease” and “diarrhea.” Overall burst keywords related to intestinal disease covered the early and middle period (−2013) such as “enterocolitis,” “Crohn’s disease,” and “diarrhea”; while extra-intestinal diseases take up the later period (2014–2021) such as “obesity,” “cardiovascular disease,” “Alzheimer’s disease,” “anxiety,” “Parkinson’s disease,” “dementia,” “depression,” “hypertension,” and “type 2 diabetes mellitus” (Figure 3A). The burst keywords involving “Immunity,” “Mechanism,” and “Metabolism” are presented in Figure 3B. Among them “colonic fermentation,” “bile,” and “lipopolysaccharide” burst at early period. On the contrary “SCFA,” “TMAO,” and “phosphatidylcholine” are detected as burst keywords in recent years. As for the intervention of the gut microbiome “FMT,” “fiber,” “dietary supplementation” and high-fat diet are identified as burst keywords over the last several years (Figure 3C).

Co-cited references are those articles cited together by other articles, and thus, can be regarded as the knowledge basis of a certain field. The knowledge map of the co-occurrence references reveals the developments and characteristics of this field (Figure 4). The nodes size, i.e., co-citations times, is generally larger than the previous one since 2007. The largest component of the co-citation network is divided into 41 clusters (size >1), which show the diversity of research topics. The top 10 articles by cited times and co-cited times are listed in Supplementary Tables 2, 3, respectively. A total of 2,115 articles are detected as citation bust, the highest strength is 185.33, and the longest duration is 9 years. Articles with high centrality are often considered as critical points or turning points in a field, and the top 10 articles are marked in Figure 4 and listed in Supplementary Table 4; their publication time range from 2002 to 2010.

The data of publications in recent 5 years is utilized to evaluate the present cooperative status in the research filed of the gut microbiome and disease. A total of 18,049 articles were from 157 countries/regions in 2017–2021; the top 10 countries in terms of publications and centrality are shown in Supplementary Table 5. More than half of the publications were produced by the United States (n = 5,323) and China (n = 5,253), accounting for 29.5 and 29.1% of the total, respectively, while every other country contributed less than 6% of the total. Figure 5A shows the international research collaborations among the leading countries in papers output in this field. A higher centrality indicates that more information is passed through the node, which implies the importance of nodes in the network. The United States has the highest centrality value (0.52), followed by England (0.31) and Germany (0.14). Besides, the United States is the most active nation with the largest number of publications in this research filed. Although China’s publications amount is commensurate with the United States, it lagged behind in collaborations with other countries. Japan and India also had poor performance in collaborations among these top 15 countries.

There are 559 out of 12,186 institutions that participated in the publication of more than 25 articles from 2017 to 2021. The top 10 institutions in terms of publications and centrality are listed in Supplementary Table 6. Harvard Medical School had the largest number of publications (n = 329) among institutions worldwide, followed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (n = 305) and the University of California San Diego (n = 225). The institutions cooperation network is shown in Figure 5B. The Harvard Medical School and the University of California San Diego are active institutions in this research filed in both publications and cooperation. There an obvious inner-country cooperation trend in the institutions cooperation network, especially in United States and China due to their large number of publications. But institutions cooperation network in the United States is more intensive than in China.

Up to 79,972 authors were involved in the publication of the 18,049 articles from2017 to 2021, and a total of 218 authors participated in the publication of at least 25 articles. Detailed information on the top 10 authors in terms of publications and centrality is provided in Supplementary Table 7. Rob Knight is the most prolific author in the field of gut microbiome and disease, followed by Wei Chen and Hao Zhang. The author cooperation network is shown in Figure 5C. Similar to the institutions cooperation network, the inner-country cooperation pattern is also observed in the author cooperation network.

114 out of 2,720 journals published more than 25 articles on the gut microbiome and disease over the 5 years. As shown in Supplementary Table 8, the top 20 journals with the highest number of articles included 4,356 records, which accounts for 24.13% of the total. Scientific reports are the most productive journal, with 605 articles in this field, followed by Frontiers in microbiology (510) and Plos one (409). Although Gut ranks 19th in terms of the number of articles published, it has the highest IF (23.059) among the 20 journals, followed by Nature communications (22.059) and Microbiome (14.650), and Gut is the most-cited journal with 92.879 citations per article. There was a significant positive correlation between impact factor values and the citations per article (R2 = 0.869, p < 0.001) for the top 20 most productive journals (Supplementary Figure 9).

By combining Figure 2 with Figure 3, we can see that diseases that have attracted continuous attention are IBD, UC and CD. In contrast, other diseases have come into researchers’ notice in recent years, such as obesity, dysbiosis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, hypertension, depression and COVID-19. Compared to diet/nutrition and drugs, probiotics draw more attention, while FMT can be identified as a frontier of research.

The data of publications in the recent 5 years is used to assess the current research status of gut microbiome and disease. The timeline view of keywords co-occurrence network reveals the development of gut microbiome and disease (Supplementary Figure 10). This network is divided into 21 clusters, which present the major subtopics in this field. Except “#0 growth performance” and “#14 oral microbiome” is irrelevant, other can be consider ongoing topics in recent. Campylobacter jejuni is commonly found in animal feces and causes human gastroenteritis, but the average year of “#16 campylobacter jejuni” is older than other clusters. In addition to utilizing keywords, co-cited references are also used to detect research hotspots and emerging trends. A total of 13 clusters are identified in the co-cited references network, and each cluster corresponds to a line of research (Figure 6). Except “#7 Aquaculture”, other clusters closely related to this field. Among these clusters, “#0 Inflammatory bowel disease” contains most of the nodes, which means that it has been widely reported. “#1 Metatrascriptomics” has most of the citation burst articles, followed by “#5 Multiple sclerosis,” “#3 trimethylamine N-oxide,” “#2 Parkinson’s disease,” which indicate they are active research areas.

A total of 541 diseases and conditions are retrieved from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/DiseasesConditions/) and the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH, https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions.html), and they are used to search against WoSCC to depict research status of the gut microbiome with them. 73 diseases and conditions have more than 100 records in WoSCC from 1996 to 2021, and their publications trend are visualized in Figure 7. “Overweight and Obesity” is an area of focus, possessing the largest number of articles. While, “Stress” ranked second, possibly because of its lexical ambiguity and irrelevant articles are hit. Gut-related diseases have been more reported than others, which are consistent with previous results. There are 5,984 records related to gut microbiome and cancers, and 19 types of cancers are involved. Colorectal (Colon) Cancer is in the first echelon with the largest amount of records (n = 2,489), and the second echelon includes Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Lung Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer, Leukemia and Liver Cancer, and others belongs to the third echelon with records less than 50 (Supplementary Figure 11).

Due to limitation of database, the earliest document is in 1996 in this study. But the first publication in this filed actually could trace back to 1958, when Eiseman et al. reported the successful treatment of pseudomembranous enterocolitis using a faecal enema (Eiseman et al., 1958). Studies about the gut microbiome and disease have increased tremendously over the last decades and present exponential growth, which revealed the important role of the gut microbiome in human health and disease (Gebrayel et al., 2022). Given that there are many unknowns about the gut microbiome and their potential applications in the prevention, diagnosis and therapy of diseases, this research scope will continue to attract keen interest among scientists, and further explorations will be conducted in the future.

In conclusion, based on the detailed bibliometrics analysis of gut microbiome and disease, we present a comprehensive overview of this evolving subject over the past 26 years. These results indicate that gut microbiome and disease is an active research field, and publications on this subject have proliferated over the past decades. The current research mainly focuses on gastrointestinal diseases, while extra-intestinal diseases are also rising, such as nerve-related diseases. Although extensive correlative studies have been performed, the molecular mechanisms still need to be explored. Overall, gut microbiome research shows a multitude of challenges and great opportunities.
