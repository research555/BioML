The gut microbiome as a modulator of healthy ageing

The gut microbiome is a contributory factor in ageing-related health loss and in several non-communicable diseases in all age groups. Some age-linked and disease-linked compositional and functional changes overlap, while others are distinct. In this Review, we explore targeted studies of the gut microbiome of older individuals and general cohort studies across geographically distinct populations. We also address the promise of the targeted restoration of microorganisms associated with healthier ageing.

Everyone ages but the deleterious effects of ageing on physical and intellectual function are not experienced uniformly. Delayed age-related decline, or ‘healthy’ ageing, is evident in many people. Determinants of healthy ageing include genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors, the latter presenting an opportunity for intervention. The microbiome transduces environmental signals, conditions host immune, metabolic and neurological function, and modifies the risk of disease, including age-related diseases. However, the microbiome has a reciprocal relationship with age: it changes as the host ages and is altered in age-related disease, but it also modifies age-related impairment of the host.

We have previously addressed the elements of a healthy microbiome while highlighting that a single universal healthy microbiome configuration does not exist2. In this Review, we focus on the dynamic relationship between the gut microbiome and ageing, including age-related disease, and explore prospects for microbial manipulation to promote healthy ageing. Throughout this Review, we specifically concentrate on the gut microbiome but the concepts are likely to be applicable to microbial communities at other body sites.

Animals harbour complex communities of gut microorganisms that show host specificity in their composition and function, and which co-evolved with their multicellular hosts3, shaped by habitual diet. In the human gut, the resident community of microorganisms reputedly numbers approximately 2,000 bacterial species4 and might outnumber the human cell count and number of different coding genes5. Interest in the human gut microbiome accelerated when culture-independent methods revealed that the microbiome was different in patients with a range of disorders compared with healthy individuals (reviewed in ref.6 and summarized in Table 1). However, few mechanisms that link pathophysiology with specific microbial metabolites lost from the normal microbiome or gained by the disease-associated microbiome have been identified7–10, a challenge exacerbated by the difficulty in defining a health-associated microbiome2. Despite these challenges, microbiome–health interactions can be assigned to a number of broad categories that are useful for considering (as we do later in this Review) how these relationships might go awry in ageing and what the effect on the host would be.

Microorganisms have developed a remarkably broad capacity to use inorganic and organic molecules as nutritional substrates; in the mammalian gut, they can catabolize plant-derived polysaccharides and resistant starches that would otherwise be unavailable to the host. Flint et al. have reviewed how changes in gut microbial metabolism of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), vitamins, lipids, gases, cholesterol and atherogenic compounds can alter host susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and cardiovascular disease11. Despite the scale and complexity, analytical advances have catalogued the most abundant microbial metabolites that affect the host (reviewed in ref.12) as well as the microbial enzymes involved. Key metabolites include SCFAs, amino acids, bile acids, vitamins, tryptamine, histamine, serotonin, dopamine, para-cresol and phenylacetylglutamine12. Thus, in addition to contributing to flux in host metabolic pathways, many microbial metabolites can affect the activity of the liver and the endocrine system13. The role of the microbiome in a multifactorial disorder such as metabolic disease is, of course, complex, and it is unclear whether the candidate mechanism and effector molecule (branched-chain amino acid production) is the sole microbial factor in type 2 diabetes mellitus14,15.

Several microbial metabolites, including SCFAs, are anti-inflammatory16 but other microbially derived macromolecules, such as exopolysaccharides, also downregulate gut inflammation17,18. Depletion of taxa that have anti-inflammatory properties, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, was highlighted in early reports of gut microbiome alterations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease19. The anti-inflammatory effects of this anaerobe have been attributed to secreted peptides20, salicylic acid21 and even the bacterial quorum-sensing molecule N-acyl homoserine lactone22.

Gut bacteria have been proposed to affect behaviour, cognition and mood by three pathways: the enteric nervous system; uptake of microbial metabolites into the circulation; and by modulating immunoinflammatory responses in the central nervous system (reviewed in ref.23). This modulatory effect of the gut microbiome on the central nervous system has been exploited for the development of specific probiotics (also known as psychobiotics) that are reported to alleviate stress24. Whether manipulation of the microbiome in humans can favourably influence mental health and neurological disorders remains to be proven. However, this research is germane to ageing, because even in the absence of severe underlying pathology, as occurs in Alzheimer disease or Parkinson disease, cognitive impairment is very common.

Ageing is a progressive loss of homeostasis, impaired function and vulnerability to death. Age-related diseases include infectious, neoplastic, metabolic and degenerative disorders with frailty and cognitive decline. At a fundamental level, the molecular and cellular hallmarks of ageing in mammalians have been identified25 but these are accompanied by changes in the microbiome, which in turn affect the rate of age-related decline (Fig. 1).

Increasing evidence suggests that transmission of microorganisms among individuals living in a social group has important health benefits29. While the spread of pathogens within social groups has received close scrutiny, strain tracking studies have shown that commensals and mutualistic microorganisms are also shared within social networks30. The microbiomes of individuals living in the same home tend to have compositional similarities, in comparison with those from people in other households31,32. Household pets can contribute to microbial sharing by acting as vectors of transmission33. Moreover, individuals with larger social networks seem to have more diverse gut microbiomes34. However, the collective microbial metacommunity of a family (the ‘social microbiome’) changes over time, with opportunities for microorganism acquisition diminishing, sometimes abruptly, for older people. Additional change depends on whether the individuals reside alone or in institutional care28 (Fig. 2). Aloneness and loss of group living are among the social changes that have become characteristic of modern socioeconomically developed societies and contrast with the past and with traditional, non-industrialized ethnic groups such as the Hutterites and the Irish Travellers29,30,35.

Microbiome studies focused on older people can be classified into two broad categories: reports of differences in gut microbiome composition related to age per se, and reports of alterations in the microbiome of older people that are associated with particular ageing-linked disorders (detailed in Tables 2,
3). The main findings from the two categories of ageing-related studies, a literature-based identification of distinct groups of taxa that show consistent alterations with ageing as well as between healthy and unhealthy ageing, along with the metabolic capabilities of these taxon groups that can direct the host to either a healthy or an unhealthy ageing trajectory, are described in this section.

In addition to the consistent taxonomic alterations summarized previously, a 2021 study (investigating two US-based population-level cohorts of 3,653 and 907 individuals) linked the degree of ‘uniqueness’ (a measure indicating how dissimilar an individual’s microbiome is from their nearest neighbour in the given population cohort) of the microbiome with ageing103. This finding appeared to be driven by loss of the core genus Bacteroides and agrees with the taxonomic alterations associated with ageing discussed previously (depletion of dominant Group 1 commensals compensated for by increased Group 3 commensals and Group 2 pathobionts). However, the link between uniqueness and healthy ageing is likely to be context dependent and additional studies are required to determine the validity of uniqueness as a marker of healthy and unhealthy ageing in different populations. More importantly, the enrichment or depletion of specific taxonomic lineages might be more valuable metrics of healthy ageing than summary statistics such as uniqueness or diversity.

Although functional versatility is a defining characteristic of the human gut microbiome, the responsiveness of the gut ecosystem to therapeutic modulation is unclear, particularly in older people, largely because the broader ecological effects of an intervention on core taxa have not been determined. Microbiome-directed or microbiome-derived therapeutic interventions include prebiotic supplements (designed to increase the abundance of specific target groups of beneficial microorganisms), single or combined beneficial taxa alone or with a prebiotic (synbiotics), postbiotics, or FMT and health-linked dietary regimens that can theoretically facilitate a broader shift in the gut microbiome towards health. The aim of such interventions is to break the self-perpetuating cycle of ageing-linked physiological decline facilitated by a disease-susceptible microbiome. From this perspective, we propose that the increased abundance of Group 2 taxa and the depletion of Group 1 and Group 3 (discussed previously) are analogous to ‘buttons’ that drive unhealthy ageing. Thus, resetting these buttons should be the key goal of any microbiome-associated therapeutic intervention targeted to healthy ageing. While numerous studies of variable size, quality and design have addressed the onset of unhealthy ageing and the microbiome of rodents91, it is doubtful whether they can be extrapolated to humans. Therefore, we restrict this commentary to studies in humans.

Similar strategies have already been adopted in population-level studies of diet–microbiome–host interactions in younger people, which predict cardiometabolic and post-prandial responses dependent on baseline host and microbiome characteristics152. In addition, a shift from low-resolution methods, such as 16S profiling, to shotgun metagenomics will be essential for resolving species-specific and strain-specific variations. Thus, incorporating predictive strategies for the design of microbiome-based studies will help realize the promise of combining precision with preventive medicine for healthy ageing.

Microbiome science is maturing through a phase of wonderment to a stage where we know enough to know how much we do not know. The metric for true advances will be the clinical impact rather than technical or computational wizardry. However, convincing evidence for the efficacy of microbiome-based therapies in humans is sparse. Curiously, ageing might offer the greatest opportunities and prospects for success. The tenuous homeostasis and limited physiological reserve of some older people might mean that relatively small improvements in the microbiome can have a profound functional influence on the individual.

Better public health messaging and food policies will be required, supported by an unassailable evidence base. Moreover, the social determinants of health will always trump personalized predictors of response. Eating healthily is unaffordable for many. This fact has been shown in the United Kingdom, one of the most affluent countries/regions on the globe155,156, where families in the lowest decile for household income would have to spend almost three-quarters of disposable income on food if they were to comply with national dietary guidelines, whereas the comparable figure for the wealthiest decile is only 6%155,156. Dietary and other microbiome-based strategies for healthy ageing should be weighed against such social inequity and should seek to develop realistic solutions.
