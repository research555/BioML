Differential Effects of Typical Korean Versus American-Style Diets on Gut Microbial Composition and Metabolic Profile in Healthy Overweight Koreans: A Randomized Crossover Trial

The Westernized diet has been associated with the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, whereas a Korean diet has been reported to exert beneficial effects on health in several studies. However, the effects of Western and Korean diets on the gut microbiome and host metabolome are unclear. To examine the diet-specific effects on microbiome and metabolome, we conducted a randomized crossover clinical trial of typical Korean diet (TKD), typical American diet (TAD), and recommended American diet (RAD). The trial involved a 4-week consumption of an experimental diet followed by a 2-week interval before diet crossover. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis identified 16, 10, and 14 differential bacteria genera specific to TKD, RAD, and TAD, respectively. The Firmucutes-Bacteroidetes ratio was increased by TKD. Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolome profiling revealed that TKD enriched branched chain amino acid metabolism, whereas ketone body metabolism was evident in RAD and TAD. Microbiome and metabolome responses to the experimental diets varied with individual enterotypes. These findings provide evidence that the gut microbiome and host metabolome rapidly respond to different cultural diets. The findings will inform clarification of the diet-related communication networks of the gut microbiome and host metabolome in humans.

Numerous studies over the past several decades have clarified the close relationship between some diets and the prevalence of various chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia [1]. In addition to the roles that nutrients and food components play in disease prevention and health maintenance, the dietary pattern has been increasingly recognized as being important, as human meals consist of a combination of various foods rather than a single food component or nutrient [2,3,4]. In this regard, dietary guidelines have been established in several countries to provide a standard for healthy meals [5]. Despite the differences in culture and food availability in many countries, it is typically considered that a healthy dietary pattern is predominantly characterized by a high intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole-grain foods, and a low intake of saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium [6].

The current study aimed to examine the effects of the standard Korean diet and the Western diet on metabolic and gut microbiota profiles in healthy Korean adults. Previous findings of the substantial inter-individual variations in the human microbiome and metabolome [39,40] prompted us to examine the microbiome and metabolome changes occurring in the same individuals in response to different dietary patterns. The dietary patterns tested included the typical Korean diet (TKD), typical Western diet (typical American diet, TAD), and recommended healthy American diet (RAD). The study hypothesis was that the different types of diet might affect the communication between the microbiome and the host metabolome in an enterotype-specific manner. To test our hypothesis, we designed a randomized crossover clinical trial and determined the changes of gut microbiome and metabolome before and after 4-week consumption of the three different diets in 61 participants. These results provide insights into an individual’s response to different types of diet and will inform the development of strategies to control metabolic diseases and promote public health.

Individuals were recruited in the area neighboring Seoul National University in Seoul, Korea. They were screened for their eligibility to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria were adult men and women aged from 25 to 65 years and body mass index (BMI) ≥23 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria included the following: (1) regular tobacco smoking; (2) patients with type 1 and/or 2 diabetes; (3) history of eating disorders or other abnormal eating habits; (4) history of major surgery of the GI tract and uncontrolled GI disorders or disease; (5) consumption of commercial pro-, pre-, and antibiotics within 6 months of the start of the study; (6) any regular intake of medication or undergoing treatment with cholesterol or blood pressure, kidney, liver, gastrointestinal, or endocrine disorders; and (7) body weight loss >10% or self-reported alcohol abuse within 12 months prior to screening. Enrolled participants were asked to report their usual diet for 3 days before the study started. The habitual diet compositions were computed using CAN-Pro 5.0 (Computer Aided Nutritional Analysis Program, the Korean Nutrition Society, Seoul, Korea) software. The present study was a randomized, three-period, crossover trial. Participants were supposed to consume each of TKD, RAD, and TAD for 4 weeks, separated by 2-week intervals for washout. They were randomly assigned to six groups according to the sequence of the diet change after stratification by sex and BMI. All meals including snacks were provided daily. Specifically, participants took breakfast at the research center from Monday through Friday; lunch, dinner, snacks, and weekend meals were packed for takeout.

In the beginning and at the end of each diet intervention, fecal, urine, and fasting blood serum were collected (Supplementary Figure S1). The study was conducted from November 2015 through January 2017. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. This study was approved by Seoul National University Institutional Review Board (IRB No. 1506/002-014) and registered with the Clinical Research Information Service (CRIS, Cheongju, Korea) of the Korea (registration No. KCT0002437).

The three trial diets were as detailed in the previous study [41]. Briefly, the meal plan for the TKD, RAD, and TAD diets were designed based on the Korean Food Guide of the Dietary Reference Intakes for Koreans [42,43], Sample Menus for a 2000 Calorie Food Pattern from the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans developed by the United States Department of Agriculture [44], and What We Eat in America dietary survey from NHANES 2001–2004 [45], respectively. The TKD, RAD, and TAD were designed to match the macronutrients composition. The TKD featured 60%–65% of energy from carbohydrates, 15% from protein, and 20%–25% from fat. The RAD featured 55% of energy from carbohydrates, 15% from protein, and 30% from fat. The TAD featured 50% of energy from carbohydrates, 15% from protein, and 35% from fat. The sodium was provided 2.7, 1.7, and 2.7 g/day/2000 kcal in TKD, RAD, and TAD, respectively. Each participants’ diet composition was computed using the CAN-Pro 5.0 software and was adjusted to ensure that body weight was maintained throughout the end of each diet intervention periods. To monitor the maintenance of initial body weight (change of <5% of initial body weight), each participant’s body weight was measured daily for 5 days (Monday-Friday) every week.

Total bacterial DNA was isolated from fecal samples using the QIAamp® DNA stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the kit protocol for pathogen detection with a few modifications. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons were amplified with universal primers, which anneal to the hypervariable region V1–V2 of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Libraries were then sequenced by an Ion S5™ XL platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequenced 16S reads were analyzed by using QIIME 1.9.1. All of detailed methods have been described previously [46]. The methods of enterotype stratification previously described and available in https://enterotype.embl.de/enterotypes.html [16].

For NMR analysis of serum samples, 200 μL of serum was mixed with 400 μL of saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride in deuterium oxide, D2O) and transferred to 5-mm NMR tubes. 1H NMR spectra of serum were acquired on an Advance III HD 800 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany) with a Bruker 5 mm CPTCI Z-GRD probe. The water-suppressed CPMG spin-echo pulse sequence (RD-90°-(τ-180°- τ) n-ACQ) was used. For all spectra of each serum, 128 transients were acquired with 64 k data points, spectral width of 16,025.641 Hz, relaxation delay of 4 s, and acquisition time of 2.045 s. For urine samples, 180 μL of urine was mixed with 360 μL of 100 mM sodium phosphate buffered D2O (pH 7.0), and 60 μL of 1 mM 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid (TSP-d4) dissolved in D2O. The mixture was transferred to 5-mm NMR tubes. Nuclear overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY)-presat, RD-180°-mixing-90°-Acq, pulse sequences were used. For all spectra of each urine, 128 transients were acquired with 64 k data points, a spectral width of 16,393.443 Hz, and the relaxation delay of 4 s, and acquisition time of 1.998 s.

All acquired 1H NMR spectra were phased, and baseline corrected using TopSpin 3.1 software (Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany) and Chenomx NMR Suite Version 7.1 (Chenomx, Edmonton, AB, Canada). The chemical shift was referenced to the signal of formate at 8.45 ppm in serum spectra and TSP in the urine spectra. Resonance assignments for serum and urine metabolites were accomplished using the 800 MHz library of Chenomx NMR Suite Version 7.1 (Chenomx, Edmonton, AB, Canada), two-dimensional NMR spectra, and spiking experiments. The synthetic electronic reference signal (ERETIC, electronic reference to access in vivo concentration) was used instead of DSS in the serum sample [47,48]. Targeted metabolic profiling of serum and urine were performed using NMR Suite Version 7.1 (Chenomx, Edmonton, AB, Canada) by integrating peak areas of metabolites compared with the areas of the known reference signal peak. Representative 800 MHz 1H NMR spectra of sera and urine are shown in Supplementary Figures S2 and S3, respectively.

Multivariate statistical analyses were performed with unit variance scale by using SIMCA-P+ software, version 12.0 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). The Statistical Package for Social Sciences software, version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), R studio, version 1.1.453, and GraphPad Prism, version 7.0a (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) were used to assess statistical significance using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Spearman’s correlation analysis.

A total of 132 individuals were recruited and 61 eligible participants entered the randomized crossover trial (Supplementary Figure S1). Individuals began by consuming an experimental diet—the TKD, TAD, or RAD—that included three meals and one snack per day. Each diet was continued for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week intervening period before beginning another diet. During the 2-week washout period, the participants resumed their usual diet. This procedure was repeated until all three experimental diets were completed. Seven participants dropped out during the trial, so data analysis included 54 paired (before/after) samples of TKD, 54 paired samples in the TAD period, and 53 paired samples in the RAD period (one RAD paired sample was omitted due to an early termination) (Supplementary Figure S1). Baseline characteristics of the study participants are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.

To evaluate the effect of experimental diets on gut microbiota profiles within an individual, we performed 16S rRNA sequencing analysis of bacterial genomic DNAs from stool samples that were collected before and after each dietary intervention. After preprocessing of the bacterial sequences for quality control, as described in the Materials and Methods, a total of 88,176,057 raw reads and an average of 272,990.9 ± 75,289.6 reads per sample were obtained. Rarefaction curves of the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) indicated that the sequencing depth was sufficient for the further analysis of commensal bacterial community profiles (Figure 1A). Next, unweighted UniFrac distance-based principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was performed to examine beta-diversity. The PCoA plot clearly distinguished the post-treatment microbial community profiles from pre-treatment samples in the TKD, RAD, and TAD samples (Figure 1B). To find out if the TKD, RAD, or TAD intervention led to a change in diversity of bacterial communities within an individual, the Shannon index for alpha-diversity was determined in each fecal sample. In a paired comparison before and after intervention, TKD promoted the diversity, whereas RAD and TAD did not (p = 0.0286; Figure 1C). The collective data indicated that, regardless of the type of diet, the experimental diet did induce changes in the bacterial communities from the state that existed when the usual diet was being consumed. In addition, these results indicated that consumption of TKD might promote gut microbial diversity.

To further investigate the specific bacterial taxa that were significantly affected by the experimental diets, we compared the composition of gut microbiota before and after TKD, RAD, and TAD intervention. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the predominant bacterial phyla in all subjects, in accordance with other reports [49,50]. After TKD consumption, Firmicutes was significantly increased (p = 0.016) and Bacteroidetes was significantly decreased (p = 0.006) compared to before TKD (Figure 2A). Consequently, a significant increase in the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes was found in the comparison of before vs. after TKD intervention (Figure 2B, p = 0.0042). The levels of those two major bacteria were not changed by either RAD or TAD.

At the genus level, we identified 23, 21, and 20 differential genera in TKD, RAD, and TAD, respectively (p < 0.05). Venn diagram analysis determined the numbers of genera unique to TKD, TAD, and RAD; seven of 23 genera in TKD were overlapped with RAD, whereas only two genera in TAD overlapped (Figure 2C). Caldicellulosiruptor, Blautia, Weissella, Coprococcus, and Neisseria were significantly increased after TKD intervention, whereas rc4-4, Bacteroides, Dialister, Catenibacterium, Butyricimonas, Slackia, Megamonas, Mitsuokella, Pseudomonas, Lactococcus, and Succiniclasticum were markedly decreased in their relative abundance (Figure 2D). The RAD intervention increased Phyllobacterium, Haemophilus, Oribacterium, Leptotrichia, Holdemania, and Lactobacillus, but decreased Ralstonia, Peptoniphilus, Enterococcus, and Bradyrhizobium. After TAD intervention, there was a significant increase in Anaerostipes, Oscillospira, Gemella, Synergistes, Lautropia, Citrobacter, and Treponema. Furthermore, TAD intake resulted in a substantial reduction in Carboxydocella, Pyramidobacter, Allistipes, Fusobacterium, Lachnospira, Porphyromonas, and Bacillus (Figure 2D). These observations that diets dramatically changed gut microbial communities in a dietary pattern specific manner prompted us to further examine the host responses to diet by performing global profiling analysis of metabolome in the host.

To investigate the changes in metabolism after the consumption of each diet, we performed metabolic profiling using NMR spectroscopy and identified a total of 37 and 48 metabolites in serum and urine, respectively. Univariate statistical analysis was used to identify significantly changed metabolites affected by each dietary intervention. The differences in metabolite levels between before and after TKD, RAD, and TAD intervention in serum and urine are summarized in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3, respectively. Serum metabolites with significant changes between before and after dietary intervention using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank are shown in Figure 3A. Serum metabolite levels of acetate, isoleucine, leucine, lactate, proline, and valine were significantly altered after TKD intervention. Levels of 2-aminobutyrate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, acetate, ascorbate, mannose, myo-inositol, and N, N-dimethylglycine were changed after RAD intervention. TAD intervention changed the levels of 2-aminobutyrate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, acetone, ascorbate, carnitine, lactate, and lysine.

In urine samples, the levels of glycolate and taurine were significantly changed after all dietary interventions (Supplementary Figure S4A). Urinary metabolite levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate (3-HMGA), citrate, dimethylamine, hippurate, and homovanillate were significantly altered after RAD intervention, whereas levels of 1-methylnicotinamide, carnitine, and pyruvate were changed after TAD intervention. Pathway analysis of urinary metabolic profiles revealed enriched taurine and hypotaurine metabolism in all dietary interventions. Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and the citrate cycle (TCA cycle) were highly enriched after RAD and TAD (Supplementary Figure S4B). The level of citrate was increased in RAD and TAD, whereas the level of pyruvate was decreased in TKD and TAD. In addition, the levels of glycolate and taurine were altered in all diet interventions (Supplementary Figure S4C).

The human gut microbiome is based on its bacteriological ecosystem, and comprises enterotypes [16]. Next, we addressed whether changes in gut bacterial composition and metabolites in the three diets could be attributed to individual enterotypes. We stratified the gut microbiota of a set of participants using Partitioning Around Medoids, and Jensen-Shannon Divergence distance clustering algorithm [16]. The baseline compositions of gut microbial genera from the 54 participants separated into three distinct clusters of Enterotype 1 (E1), Enterotype 2 (E2), and Enterotype 3 (E3) (Figure 4A). The optimal number of clusters was determined by the Calinski-Harabasz index (Supplementary Figure S5A). Of the 54 participants, 22 belonged to E1, 12 to E2, and 20 to the E3 enterotype. Kruskal–Wallis testing revealed that Bacteroides and Prevotella were the significant bacteria that distinguished enterotypes (Figure 4B). The percentage of Bacteroides was overrepresented in E1 individuals (97.74%), whereas Prevotella was overrepresented in E3 individuals (83.71%). The E2 group had a rather balanced ratio of Bacteroides (65.00%) and Prevotella (35.00%) (Supplementary Figure S5B). General characteristics at baseline were not significantly different among the three enterotype groups (p > 0.05) (Supplementary Table S4).

Collinsella, Faecalibacterium, and Mitsuokella were significantly increased in E1 after TKD intervention, whereas Prevotella was markedly decreased (all p < 0.05; Figure 4D). Actinobacillus and Blautia were significantly increased in E3 after TKD intervention, whereas Lactococcus was markedly decreased (all p < 0.05; Figure 4D). In the RAD intervention, there were five, five, and seven genera unique to E1, E2, and E3, respectively. In the TAD intervention, Lautropia and Streptococcus were significantly increased in E1, whereas Butyricimonas and Catenibacterium were markedly decreased (all p < 0.05; Figure 4D). Oscillospira and Christensenella were significantly increased in E3, whereas Propionibacterium was markedly decreased (all p < 0.05; Figure 4D). Interestingly, Bifidobacterium, which is a well-known probiotic with health benefits in humans, was increased in abundance in the gut by TKD in E1 type individuals, by RAD for E2 type individuals, and by TAD in E3 type individuals, implying that the responses of Bifidobacterium to each dietary pattern were not the same to all individuals and varied depending on the specific enterotype. Taken together, these observations imply that changes in intestinal microbial communities driven by dietary intervention might be dependent on the enterotype of the host. In addition, we compared the concentration of specific metabolites (listed in Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S4A) in each enterotype before and after TKD, RAD, and TAD intervention. Six and three metabolites in serum and urine, respectively, showed different changes of concentration according to enterotypes (Figure 4E,F). Serum concentration of isoleucine was significantly decreased only in the E3 group after TKD intervention. After RAD intervention, concentration of serum acetate was significantly increased only in the E3 group. Serum carnitine level significantly increased only in the E1 group after TAD intervention. Concentration of urinary dimethylamine was significantly decreased only in the E1 group after TAD intervention. Although the changes in host metabolites are less dramatic than those in gut microbiome, our results suggest that the enterotypes could partially affect specific response of host metabolites to the dietary intervention.

Growing attention is being paid to the role of diet in modulating the gut microbiome and consequently affecting various physiological processes involved in human health and disease [8]. To our best of knowledge, this is the first intervention study to examine the effects of different dietary patterns on the gut microbiome and host metabolome profiles within the same individuals, using Korean and American diets. The Korean diet is characterized by high levels of vegetable, whole grains, and low levels of animal-derived foods and saturated fat [51]. On the other hand, a typical American diet, also known as the Western diet, is characterized by high levels of processed meat, added sugars, and saturated fat and low intakes of vegetable, fiber, and fruits [52]. In this study, we also examined a healthy American diet to compare the diet to the typical American diet and/or Korean diets on the intestinal bacterial communities and host metabolome. The healthy American diet tested in this study was based on the 2010 Dietary Guideline for Americans provided by the United States Department of Agriculture, which recommends a diet that is high in fruit, vegetables, low-fat dairy, whole grains, and lean protein foods and low in saturated fatty acid, sodium, and refined sugar and grains [53,54]. Differential effects of those diets were examined in overweight individuals in this study. Compared to normal weight individuals, obese and overweight individuals are more prone to develop microbial dysbiosis and metabolic disturbances [55,56]; therefore, the unbalanced shape of intestinal bacterial communities and dysregulated metabolome profiles were targeted and studied in the present study. To determine the diet-specific effects on the gut microbiome, we used a randomized crossover design in this study, because substantial variation between individuals is a well-known obstacle to microbiome studies in humans. This design enabled us to compare the different effects of the three distinct diets in the same individuals. However, the crossover design can suffer from a disadvantage called the carry-over effect, in which the consequences of one intervention could be carried over from one intervention period to another [55]. Therefore, to avoid a potential carry-over effect, we inserted a 2-week washout phase between each dietary intervention period. This period of washout was long enough to return the gut microbiome that had been changed by the experimental diet to the state of baseline within an individual (data not shown).

In conclusion, to our knowledge, this study compared for the first time the differential roles that a Korean diet and two American diets, healthy and typical, played in modulating intestinal bacterial communities and host metabolite profiles in a crossover design. We demonstrated that 4-week consumption of each diet dramatically changed the gut microbiome structure and serum metabolome networks in a diet-specific manner. Differences in Korean diet vs. American diets was much more dramatic than any other comparisons of three different diets. Although we found the diversity of bacterial communities and ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes at the phylum level were changed only by the Korean diet, at the genus level the taxon matrix specific to Koreans, typical American, and healthy American diets were identified. Global metabolome profiling analysis and pathway analysis revealed the metabolism of BCAAs and ketone bodies as significant networks that distinguished Korean diet and both American diets. Additionally, we demonstrated that a response of gut microbiome-host interaction to a diet might vary based on the individual’s enterotype. These findings indicate that the gut microbiome and host metabolome respond rapidly to different cultural diets and provide information that will be helpful for constructing the communication networks of the gut microbiome and host metabolome with roles of diet in orchestrating the communication in humans, and developing strategies for personalized nutrition.
