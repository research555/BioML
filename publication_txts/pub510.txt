Metagenome-assembled genomes and gene catalog from the chicken gut microbiome aid in deciphering antibiotic resistomes

Gut microbial reference genomes and gene catalogs are necessary for understanding the chicken gut microbiome. Here, we assembled 12,339 microbial genomes and constructed a gene catalog consisting of ~16.6 million genes by integrating 799 public chicken gut microbiome samples from ten countries. We found that 893 and 38 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) in our dataset were putative novel species and genera, respectively. In the chicken gut, Lactobacillus aviarius and Lactobacillus crispatus were the most common lactic acid bacteria, and glycoside hydrolases were the most abundant carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). Antibiotic resistome profiling results indicated that Chinese chicken samples harbored a higher relative abundance but less diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) than European samples. We also proposed the effects of geography and host species on the gut resistome. Our study provides the largest integrated metagenomic dataset from the chicken gut to date and demonstrates its value in exploring chicken gut microbial genes.

Chickens are an important source of meat and eggs for humans, and over 60 billion chickens are estimated to exist worldwide1. A large number of microbes, including bacteria and archaea, colonize the chicken gastrointestinal tract and may play vital roles in the degradation of nutrients2, immune system development3, pathogen exclusion4, abdominal fat mass5, feed efficiency6, etc. Understanding the roles of the chicken gut microbiome is essential for manipulating gut microbes to promote chicken health and increase the efficiency of chicken production.

In the current study, we combined the metagenomic data of the chicken gut microbiome from China and European countries to build an integrated chicken gut microbial reference genomes and gene catalog. We annotated and analyzed the assembled genomes and gene catalog using multiple bioinformatic tools and databases. We also profiled the ARGs in the chicken gut microbiome using the newly assembled MAGs and the gene catalog and compared chicken and human gut antibiotic resistomes. These integrated genomic and gene resources are essential for better understanding the structure and functions of the chicken gut microbiome.

We assembled expanded MAGs and constructed an integrated gene catalog using metagenomic sequencing data from 799 public chicken gut microbiome samples in China and Europe for the workflow (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1 and 2). After binning the metagenomic contigs, we generated 12,339 dereplicated MAGs (99% average nucleotide identity, ANI) and 1978 dereplicated MAGs (95% ANI) from 19,750 high-quality MAGs (completeness ≥80%, contamination ≤10%, Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 3). The overwhelming majority of chicken gut microbes were bacteria (1970 genomes), and archaea were extremely scarce (eight genomes). According to the GTDB-Tk assignments, the most dominant phylum was Firmicutes A (n = 822), followed by Bacteroidota (n = 348). When redundant MAGs reported in two recent studies21,22 were removed from our data, a total of 893 species-level MAGs (45.1%) were putative novel species, and a total of 38 genera were candidate novel genera (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c and Supplementary Data 4 and 5). The greatest numbers of novel species-level (n = 20) and genus-level (n = 9) MAGs belonged to the genera RC9/Alistipes and the order Oscillospirales, respectively. Two MAGs (MAGs_co_3131 and MAGs_co_10417) could only be assigned to the class level. Strains of Firmicutes A and Bacteroidota exhibited the highest diversity, as reflected by the Shannon index (Supplementary Fig. 1d), suggesting their contributions to the chicken gut microbiota composition and successful niche occupation and niche/substrate specialization. Strains in the Bacteroidota phylum had relatively larger genome sizes and higher proportions of CAZymes (Supplementary Fig. 1e, f), implying their important role in digesting complex carbohydrates; thus, these strains may increase feed efficiency in chickens23. Four of the eight archaeal genomes (95% ANI) were novel species, which all belonged to the phylum Thermoplasmatota (Supplementary Data 4) and were located relatively close to Candidatus Methanomethylophilus alvus Mx-05 in the phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 6). Ca. M. alvus Mx-05 was recently isolated from the human gut and demonstrated to have the ability to convert trimethylamine into methane24.

After mapping reads to the dereplicated MAGs at the strain level, over 85.0% of reads were mapped in most samples (Supplementary Fig. 3a and Supplementary Data 7), demonstrating that our MAGs well represented the chicken gut microbiome. There were 705 samples harboring more than 100 strains, while other samples appeared to contain fewer strains, which may have been due to the limited sequencing depth (Supplementary Fig. 3b). We removed samples with less than 15 million paired reads for most of the downstream analyses, and 477 samples remained (Supplementary Data 8). Variations were observed between samples. At ≥1× coverage, 10,657 MAGs existed in less than 50 gut samples, while only 43 MAGs were present in more than 300 samples (Fig. 2b). Two strains of Lactobacillus aviarius and Lactobacillus crispatus were very common in the chicken gut microbiota, presenting in over half of the samples (Supplementary Fig. 3c). This implies the importance of these two autochthonous lactic acid bacteria in chickens. A total of 535 MAGs were shared among samples from the ten countries (Supplementary Data 9), most of which belonged to Limosilactobacillus (n = 153), followed by Escherichia (n = 101) and Lactobacillus (n = 78) (Supplementary Fig. 3d and Supplementary Data 10). Among the 535 shared MAGs, 71.2% (381/535) were novel strains, but no novel genera were shared. The novel strains were mainly from the three genera mentioned above: Limosilactobacillus (n = 92), Escherichia (n = 81), and Lactobacillus (n = 67). Due to the strain-specific properties of Escherichia and lactic acid bacteria25,26, strain-level characterization of chicken gut microbes deserves more attention.

We next built an integrated chicken gut microbial gene catalog (GG-IGC) containing 16.6 million nonredundant genes, which was 1.8 times larger than the previous reference gene catalog of the chicken gut microbiome (CGM-RGC, 9 million)7. The lengths of genes in the GG-IGC ranged from 102 bp to 91,812 bp, with a median value of 1083 bp, and more than 63.1% of these genes were complete open reading frames. There were 4,987,193 genes in GG-IGC assigned to 10,665 different KEGG orthologs, compared with 2,611,763 genes assigned to 10,046 KEGG orthologs in CGM-RGC. In addition, 11,290,604 (68.2%) and 6,960,807 (77.0%) genes were annotated with COG functional categories in the GG-IGC and CGM-RGC, respectively (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 11). The GG-IGC contained 1.9 and 2.5 times more genes with unknown functions [S] and no-hit results, respectively, than the CGM-RGC (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data 12). These results suggested that the GG-IGC expanded the current chicken gut gene catalog in both microbial gene number and gene function, facilitating better characterization of the roles of the chicken gut microbial community in future multiomics studies. In addition, our results, together with gut microbiome gene catalogs in different hosts from previous studies18,19,27,28, demonstrated many genes in gut microbial gene catalogs have unknown functions or even lack matches in any database. Therefore, a large number of gut microbes and their functions have not been recognized, which warrants further investigation.

Plasmid typing results showed that 27 types (total 145) of plasmids were present in more than 60% of samples. The top three plasmid types in the chicken gut were repUS43, repUS64 and rep22 (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b and Supplementary Data 13). The commonly present repUS43 may be a carrier of the tetracycline resistance gene tet(M) in the chicken gut microbiome, as reported previously29,30. Plasmid patterns in samples from China were different from those from the other countries, and they included fewer IncX3, IncX1, p0111, and IncI1 plasmid types (Supplementary Fig. 6c, d). IncX3 plasmids have been described to carry various carbapenemase genes in carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae worldwide31. The common VF genes in the chicken gut were carried by bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family, including arcB, entB, entE, entF, rhs/PAAR, and vgrG/tssI (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Data 14), highlighting the pathogenic role of Enterobacteriaceae. Plasmid patterns and virulence gene profiles are highly associated with HGT events32, and more efforts are needed to accurately identify the mobile genetic elements involved by using metagenomic methods in gut microbiome studies.

We used the expanded MAGs and the GG-IGC to explore the antibiotic resistome in the chicken gut microbiome. We first analyzed the ARGs in the MAGs and found that 1388 of the 12,339 (11.2%) strain-level MAGs harbored 235 ARG types. The common ARGs in the MAGs were lnu(C) (n = 201), mdf(A) (n = 120), and ant(6)-Ia (n = 90) (Supplementary Fig. 8a and Supplementary Data 15). Escherichia, Romboutsia, and Enterococcus were the top three genera containing the greatest number of ARGs in each genome (≥5 genomes were considered in each genus) (Fig. 4a). HGT prediction analysis indicated that HGT events occurred frequently among Lachnospiraceae, Bacteroidaceae, Oscillospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Acutalibacteraceae but rarely among Lactobacillaceae and other families (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Concerning HGT between gut bacteria, this result reinforces the general notion of lactobacilli as safe. Among the 20,694 genes that may be subjected to horizontal gene transfer, only 17 were ARGs (Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Data 16). The low positive rate for ARGs in MAGs may have been affected by the plasmid recovery rate and genomic islands during the process of genome binning33. Consistent with a previous study, tetracycline and macrolide AMR were most abundant in the chicken gut microbiome at the genome level34.

We then annotated ARGs in the 9.9 million gene catalog of the human gut35 and compared resistomes between humans and chickens. We showed that 1) the chicken gut contained more ARG types than humans (304 vs. 179), and both human samples and chicken samples from China harbored higher abundances of ARGs than European samples. 2) Gut samples from the same host, either chicken or human, shared a higher number of ARGs (87.8% between Chinese and European chicken samples and 89.4% between Chinese and European human samples). 3) Chinese human and chicken samples shared a slightly higher number of ARGs than that shared between European samples (42.3% vs. 40.8%). 4) Additionally, the effect of geography on the antibiotic resistome was lower than that of the host species (Fig. 4g–i and Supplementary Fig. 11).

By integrating metagenomic data of the chicken gut microbiome, we expanded the reference microbial genomes in the chicken gut and constructed an integrated gut microbial gene catalog. These data provide a foundation for further functional characterizations and taxonomic assignments of chicken gut microbes. We profiled the antibiotic resistome in the chicken gut using an integrated dataset and revealed the role of plasmids in shaping ARG patterns in the gut microbiome and the host specificity of ARGs in chicken and human gut microbial communities.

We collected metagenomic data from four publicly available chicken gut microbiome sequencing projects from China and nine European countries in this study, including PRJEB33338 (n = 24)21, PRJEB22062 (n = 178)34, PRJNA417359 (n = 495)7 and PRJNA408020 (n = 102), the latter of which we generated previously13. An integrated catalog of 9.9 million reference genes in the human gut microbiome35 was included for the comparison of gut antibiotic resistomes.

Before assembly, low-quality bases (Phred score  < 20) and residual Illumina adapter contaminations were excluded using fastp (v0.19.4)36 and Cutadapt (v1.18)37, respectively, and reads mapped to chicken, maize, soybean, wheat and zebrafish genomes by BMTagger (v1.1.0) were filtered out. The clean reads of each metagenome were assembled independently using MEGAHIT (v1.1.3)38. To increase the generated number of MAGs, coassembly was further performed by dividing all 799 samples into 29 groups using MEGAHIT. The criteria for the grouping of metagenomes were based on various projects and the size of the sequencing data. For metagenomic binning, three methods, i.e., MetaBAT2 (v2.12.1)39, Maxbin2 (v2.2.6)40 and Concoct (v1.0.0)41, were used. A superior bin set from multiple original binning predictions was produced with the Binning_refiner module42 of MetaWRAP43. The completeness and contamination of each bin from the superior bin set were evaluated using CheckM (v1.0.12)44. Afterward, bins with ≥80% completeness and ≤10% contamination were retained. To improve the bin quality, bins were reassembled with SPAdes (v3.13.0)45 in the Reassemble_bins module of MetaWRAP (v1.2.1)43. All MAGs were dereplicated at 99% ANI (equivalent to the strain level) and 95% ANI (equivalent to the species level) using dRep (v2.6.2)46. GTDB-Tk47 was used to assign taxonomy to the MAGs. CompareM (v0.1.2, http://github.com/dparks1134/CompareM) was used to calculate the average amino acid identity (AAI) among the MAGs. Genomes were defined as novel strains if the ANI output by GTDB-Tk was <99%. Genomes were determined as novel species if the ANI output by GTDB-Tk was <95%. Genera were defined as novel if all MAGs clustered at 60% AAI were not assigned a genus by GTDB-Tk47. We also compared the MAGs with those reported in chicken gut microbiomes in previous studies21,22 to avoid redundancy. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using PhyloPhlAn (v3.0.60)48. The phylogenetic tree was based on 400 universal markers defined in PhyloPhlAn and built using the following set of parameters: “-diversity high -fast -remove_fragmentary_entries –subsample fivehundred –min_num_markers 50”. The coverage of MAGs at the strain level was calculated as previously described11. The standalone run_dbCAN2 (v2.0.11)49 was used to detect the presence of CAZyme genes in the MAGs. Mass screening of the MAGs for acquired ARGs was performed using ABRicate software (https://github.com/tseemann/abricate), which integrates the Resfinder database50, VFDB51, and PlasmidFinder database52. All phylogenetic trees were visualized using iTOL (v6.1.1)53. Taxonomic classification of the chicken gut microbiome was performed using Kraken 2 (v2.0.9-beta)54, and we estimated the abundance of each species using Bracken (v2.6)55.

Gene prediction of the contigs from each sample was performed by Prodigal (v2.6.3)56 with the parameter “-p meta”. The predicted genes were filtered to remove genes shorter than 100 bp. A nonredundant gene catalog was constructed from the predicted genes by MMseq257 with the parameter “easy-cluster -min-seq-id 0.95 -c 0.9” to cluster the genes with the criteria of identity ≥95% and overlap ≥90%. To calculate relative gene abundances, clean reads from each sample were aligned against the gene catalog by BWA-MEM2 (v2.1)58. The outputs were converted to the BAM format by SAMtools (v1.11)59. Then, the BAM files were translated to abundances using the “jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depth” script from MetaBAT 239. The nonredundant gene catalog was annotated with KofamKOALA (v1.3.0)60 to assign KEGG Orthology. eggNOG-mapper (v2.0.1b)61 was used to assign clusters of orthologous groups (COG) functional categories. The presence of CAZyme genes, acquired antimicrobial resistance genes, virulence genes and plasmid replicon genes in the gene catalog was analyzed by the method described above. To explore colistin-resistance genes with low copy numbers that were not included in the gene catalog, clean reads of each sample were aligned to colistin-resistance genes in the ResFinder database50 using BWA-MEM258.

To identify HGT within chicken gut communities, HGT analysis was performed using MetaCHIP (v1.10.0) on all dereplicated MAGs (clustered with 95% ANI) at the family level. The identification of HGT was performed by the combination of best-match and phylogenetic approaches. The predicted gene flows were visualized using the circlize package in R62. The identified HGT genes were further screened against the ResFinder database to identify ARGs using the software ABRicate, as described above.

The Shannon index and Bray–Curtis distance were calculated by the vegan (v2.5–7) package in R. Differential abundance analysis was performed by a two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test. When multiple hypotheses were considered simultaneously, P-values were adjusted to control the false discovery rate in R with the method described previously63. To determine the effect of the microbiota and the plasmids on the antibiotic resistome, we used Procrustes analysis to determine correlations based on abundance profile Bray–Curtis distances. The correlation between the two datasets was determined by using the “protest” function in R.
