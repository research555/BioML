Gut microbiome composition is associated with spatial structuring and social interactions in semi-feral Welsh Mountain ponies



Microbiome composition is linked to host functional traits including metabolism and immune function. Drivers of microbiome composition are increasingly well-characterised; however, evidence of group-level microbiome convergence is limited and may represent a multi-level trait (i.e. across individuals and groups), whereby heritable phenotypes are influenced by social interactions. Here, we investigate the influence of spatial structuring and social interactions on the gut microbiome composition of Welsh mountain ponies.

We show that semi-feral ponies exhibit variation in microbiome composition according to band (group) membership, in addition to considerable within-individual variation. Spatial structuring was also identified within bands, suggesting that despite communal living, social behaviours still influence microbiome composition. Indeed, we show that specific interactions (i.e. mother-offspring and stallion-mare) lead to more similar microbiomes, further supporting the notion that individuals influence the microbiome composition of one another and ultimately the group. Foals exhibited different microbiome composition to sub-adults and adults, most likely related to differences in diet.

We provide novel evidence that microbiome composition is structured at multiple levels within populations of social mammals and thus may form a unit on which selection can act. High levels of within-individual variation in microbiome composition, combined with the potential for social interactions to influence microbiome composition, suggest the direction of microbiome selection may be influenced by the individual members present in the group. Although the functional implications of this require further research, these results lend support to the idea that multi-level selection can act on microbiomes.

All metazoan species harbour complex communities of microorganisms referred to as host microbiomes. The host plus its microbiome can be considered as a distinct biological entity, the holobiont, with a complementary genome, the hologenome [1]. Although the concept of a holobiont remains a topic of debate [2, 3], there are several compelling arguments for why this approach is biologically relevant. First, microbiome composition can be heritable such that offspring microbiomes resemble those of their parents [4]. Second, microbiome genomes are much more plastic and evolvable over short periods of time than host genomes, providing hosts with phenotypic plasticity that can respond more rapidly to external and internal challenges [5]. Third, these diverse communities are associated with host functional traits, such as immune function and metabolism, as demonstrated across a range of host sites for both mammalian and non-mammalian taxa [6–8]. For example, microbiome composition and complexity has been associated with disease prevalence for many host taxa at the individual and population level [9–12]. Many host species have a considerable 'core' microbiome that is stable with a body site across individuals, time, and space [13–17]. This core microbiome is thought to represent the heritable "house-keeping" component of the microbiome, while there is also a flexible component to the microbiome that varies based on environmental influences [5]. At the same time, there is significant temporal variation in microbiome composition between and within individuals of a given species [18, 19].

Here, we determine how the gut microbiome of semi-feral ponies from Snowdonia National Park is influenced by spatial structuring, social interactions, and kin relationships. Using social network analysis combined with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of faecal samples, we test the following hypotheses: (i) there will be within-individual variation in microbiome composition, but this will not be as large as between-individual variation; (ii) mares will have more similar microbiomes to band stallions than to other mares in their band; (iii) mares will have more similar microbiomes to their own offspring than to other juveniles in the band; (iv) band, life stage, and sex will influence microbiome composition; (v) band-level variation in microbiome composition will be driven by spatial structuring (i.e. social networks).

Carneddau Welsh mountain ponies are located in the Carneddau mountain range, Snowdonia National Park, North Wales (53.22°N, 3.95°W) over an area of approximately 35–40 km2 of commons land between 287 and 610 m above sea level. The land is used primarily for sheep farming and recreational hiking and thus ponies are habituated to human presence but not to physical contact. The population is essentially unmanaged aside from an annual roundup event each November, during which individuals are herded onto adjacent farmland for 1 to 2 days for population monitoring and management purposes. Individuals can be identified using their age-sex classification and a photographic database that depicts coat colour, face and leg markings, and ear tags/notches. For this study, we collected data from 30 individuals across three focal bands (Aber, Marsh, and Valley) that have been the subjects of long-term behavioural and demographic data collection [39, 40] (Table 1).

Demography and proximity data were collected over ten sampling days between the 21 August and 14 November 2014 (the same time period when faecal sampling also occurred). All ponies included in the spatial analyses were sighted a minimum of 5 days, sampled opportunistically within the study area. Upon encountering a group, we recorded time, pony IDs, and GPS location along with an approximate spatial network of the ponies. We plotted the geographic distribution of the bands over the study period using the ggmap package [41] in RStudio (v1.0.153) [42] for R (v3.4.1) [43].

For the social network analysis, we approximated the distance in metres between individuals. All individuals less than ~ 100 m apart and moving as a cohesive unit were considered to be associated with each other [40]. Association matrices were constructed for each day of sampling; individuals that were close together (< 15 m) or interacted were given a score of 2, other individuals (i.e. those 15–100 m apart) were given a score of 1 and more than 100 m apart scored 0. Using these association scores, an overall weighted association index for each dyad was calculated using a modified version of the simple ratio index [44], where edge weight was calculated as:

For each band, faecal samples were collected from the stallion plus 4–7 mares and 2–5 juveniles (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S1) between the 21st August and 11th November 2014, prior to the annual round-up. Faecal samples were collected using sterile gloves. Most samples were collected within 10 minutes of defecation, but on rare occasions, this took up to a maximum of 1 hour when multiple individuals defecated within a short period. Several samples were collected from different parts of the dung pile, but no faeces in contact with the ground were collected (thus, there was minimal risk of environmental contamination). The samples were mixed thoroughly by hand in a sterile bag and a subsample retained for analysis. Three to five samples were collected per individual across the four study months (Additional file 1: Table S1). Samples were stored and transported in cool bags to the University of Manchester the same day and frozen at − 80 °C prior to DNA extraction.

DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, UK) following the manufacturer’s protocol with an additional incubation time of 30 min at 95 °C. A blank extraction was also included to act as a negative control for sequencing. DNA was amplified for the 16S rRNA gene (v4 region) using dual-indexed forward and reverse primers according to Kozich et al. [45] and Griffiths et al. [29]. Briefly, PCRs were run in duplicate using Solis BioDyne 5x HOT FIREPol® Blend Master Mix, 2 μM primers and 1 μl of sample DNA. Thermocycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 15 min; 28 cycles of (95 °C for 20 s, 50 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 60 s), and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR replicates were checked on an Agilent 2200 TapeStation, combined into a single PCR plate and cleaned using HighPrep™ PCR clean up beads (MagBio, USA) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Products were quality checked using an Agilent 2200 TapeStation and quantified using a Qubit™ 3.0 Fluorometer according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Samples were pooled according to concentrations in order to minimise sequencing bias. Paired-end (2 × 250 bp) amplicon sequencing was conducted on an Illumina MiSeq platform with negative and positive (mock community) controls.

We conducted all analyses in RStudio (v1.0.153) [42] for R (v3.4.1) [43]. A total of 3,208,334 raw sequence reads from 112 samples were generated during sequencing. We conducted sequence processing in dada2 v1.5.0 [46] using the default pipeline (see Additional files 1, 2, 3, and 4). Modal contig length was 253 bp once paired-end reads were merged. We removed sequence variants (SVs) with length > 260 bp (4 SVs; 0.086% of total sequences) along with chimeras and two SVs found in the negative controls, leaving an average of 22,294 reads per sample (range 8071–42,869). We assigned taxonomy using the SILVA v128 database [47, 48]. To provide greater taxonomic detail about unidentified SVs and to stop the removal of these during analyses that agglomerate to a given taxonomic level, we fully annotated the taxonomy table to species level using higher levels assignments (e.g. SV1 was named “Family_Prevotellaceae” at the genus and species levels). We exported the final SV table, taxonomy table, and sample metadata to the phyloseq package [49] and converted the data to relative abundance for further analyses.

We produced an NMDS plot in phyloseq using the Bray-Curtis distance matrix to visualise the variation within and between individuals according to community composition. To determine the microbiome variation attributable to individual variation (ID), we conducted a permutational ANOVA (PERMANOVA; adonis) in the vegan package [50].

To determine whether there was greater microbiome variation within an individual than between individuals, we calculated Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) values in the phyloseq package [49]. JSD values give a measure of similarity between all individual samples (i.e. by calculating the distance between samples) either from the same individual (i.e. within-individual variation) or from different individuals in the same band (i.e. between-individual variation). Smaller JSD values indicate more similar microbial communities and conversely, larger values indicate a less similar community. We used a generalised linear mixed model with ID and band as random factors to compare JSD distances within individuals to JSD distances between individuals and visualised the data using a bar chart.

We categorised individuals under the age of 1 year as foals and for older individuals, females < 2 years old and males < 3 years old as sub-adults (females are usually reproductively mature from 2 years onwards but males take longer to mature, disperse, and attract mares). We classified all others as adults, with the exception of one female who still displayed sub-adult behaviours, did not disperse from her natal band, and had not foaled by age 3, and so was considered a sub-adult. We visualised the taxonomic composition (at the class level) of the communities according to band and life stage using stacked plots in phyloseq [49] and ggplot2 [52].

To identify differences in microbiome composition between foals (which at approximately 5–8 months old, were most likely still nursing) and sub-adults (which were most likely fully weaned), we conducted an indicator analysis using the multipatt function in the indicspecies package [53].

We correlated the social network association matrix with the NMDS scores of each individuals’ average microbiome using Kendall’s correlation coefficient for non-parametric data with ties. Networks were constructed and visualised using the igraph package [54] with edges weighted by either microbiome similarity (the inverse of the NMDS distance) or the association index as described above. As the microbiome distance matrix is fully connected, we delated edges with a similarity less than the mean value for the population. We calculated JSD values between merged samples in the phyloseq package [49] and used general linear mixed models (with ID and band as random factors) to identify whether mares had more similar microbiomes to other mares within the same band or to the band stallion and whether mares had more similar microbiomes to their own offspring than to other mares’ offspring within the same band. We visualised these using bar charts.

Bacteria primarily belonged to the Bacteroidia, Clostridia, Spirochaetes, and Fibrobacteria classes (Bacteroidetes, Fibrobacteres, Firmicutes, and Spirochaetae phyla) (Additional file 1: Figure S1 and S2). The dominant families represented in the core microbiome were anaerobic bacteria associated with grass-eating mammals, including Prevotellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Spirochaetaceae, Fibrobacteraceae, Christensenallaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Acidaminococcaceae, and various groups of Bacteroidales.

Maternal relationship had a significant effect on microbiome similarity (χ2 = 8.425, df = 2, p = 0.015; Fig. 2c). Pairwise comparisons showed significant differences in microbiome divergence between mother-offspring relationships and non-maternal mares and juveniles (foals and sub-adults combined) (p = 0.017). Microbiome divergences between foal-less mares and juveniles were not significantly different to those of mother-offspring relationships (p = 0.313) or non-maternal mares and juveniles (p = 1.000). Mares had significantly more similar microbiomes to the band stallion than the other mares in their band (χ2 = 4.206, df = 1, p = 0.040; Fig. 2d).

The effects of population structuring, in general, and social interactions, in particular, on microbiome composition remains poorly understood; challenges often arise in the separation of direct microbiota transmission via social interactions from effects of communal living such as a shared diet or physical environment [27, 32]. Here, we show that despite large variation between individuals in microbiome composition, spatial structuring, social relationships (i.e. mother-offspring and stallion-mare), and network ties account for microbiome similarities. The main predictor of microbiome composition is individual identity (pony ID), accounting for around 50% of microbiome variation, with ~26% variation across multiple samples collected for each individual and ~34% variation between individuals. Significant inter-individual variation in microbiome composition has been shown in other species [18, 19, 28, 55–57]. Given that such a large component of microbiome variation is due to individual ID, which individuals are present in the band (both mares and stallions) may well influence the composition of the total group microbiome.

We also demonstrate differences between life stages in microbiome composition of Carneddau ponies; foals had considerably different microbiome composition to both sub-adults and adults. Similar changes in microbiome composition across host development have been seen in other host organisms [10, 29, 65]. For mammals, this is particularly evident for nursing young compared with weaned individuals [66–68], and this most likely explains the results we see in our data. There was an absence of unique genera in the microbiome of foals, indicating the transition to a grass-based diet leads to the assimilation of additional bacterial groups into the gut microbiome, potentially through environmental transmission. Although gut microbiome composition has been shown to differ between sexes [69], we found that microbiomes were not significantly different between males and females for this population of semi-feral ponies. However, this may reflect a low number of males in the analysis. It would be of interest to follow changes in male microbiome across dispersion and particularly shifts in composition as stallions form new family groups and their microbiome is influenced by, and influences, new mares joining their band.

Here, we show that semi-feral ponies exhibit variation in microbiome composition between bands, which may relate to social, dietary, and environmental factors. In addition, due to the high level of within-individual variation, the direction of group selection may be influenced by the individual members present in the band. Spatial structuring was also identified within bands, suggesting that despite communal living, social behaviours still influence microbiome composition. We identify two such interactions; mother-offspring and stallion-mare, that lead to more similar microbiomes, indicating that individuals influence the microbiome composition of one another and ultimately the group. Thus, we provide novel evidence that microbiome composition is structured at multiple levels within populations. The functional implications of this require further research.
