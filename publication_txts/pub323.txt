Diet and the microbiota–gut–brain-axis: a primer for clinical nutrition

Diet is an essential modulator of the microbiota–gut–brain communication in health and disease. Consequently, diet-induced microbiome states can impact brain health and behaviour. The integration of microbiome into clinical nutrition perspectives of brain health is sparse. This review will thus focus on emerging evidence of microbiome-targeted dietary approaches with the potential to improve brain disorders.

Research in this field is evolving toward randomized controlled trials using dietary interventions with the potential to modulate pathways of the microbiota–gut–brain-axis. Although most studies included small cohorts, the beneficial effects of Mediterranean-like diets on symptoms of depression or fermented foods on the immune function of healthy individuals shed light on how this research line can grow. With a clinical nutrition lens, we highlight several methodological limitations and knowledge gaps, including the quality of dietary intake information, the design of dietary interventions, and missing behavioural outcomes.

Findings in diet–microbiome–brain studies can have groundbreaking implications in clinical nutrition practice and research. Modulating brain processes through diet via the gut microbiota raises numerous possibilities. Novel dietary interventions targeting the microbiota–gut–brain-axis can offer various options to prevent and treat health problems such as mental disorders. Furthermore, knowledge in this field will improve current nutritional guidelines for disease prevention.

The gut microbiota refers to the trillions of microorganisms residing within the gut, with the microbiome referring to the full collection of genes of these gut microbes. It is now established that this community of bacteria is an essential determinant of key set points across multiple aspects of human physiology [1], including critical functions in energy metabolism [2▪▪] and immunity [3▪▪], extending from gastrointestinal health to brain function and behaviour [1,4,5,6▪]. A central question is whether ‘feeding the microbiome’ modulates brain function and human behaviour [7]. The beneficial effects of diet can be moderated or mediated via processes involving the communication pathways between the gut microbiome and the brain (i.e., the microbiota–gut–brain-axis) [8].

Although clinical evidence is limited, recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the available evidence have shed light on microbiota signatures in psychiatric disorders [9,10▪▪,11,12]. These findings led to novel research in microbiome-targeted therapies termed ‘psychobiotics’, including administration of live organisms (i.e., prebiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics), faecal microbial transplants, and dietary interventions to reshape microbiome composition and function to a protective profile with beneficial effects on brain and behaviour [7,13,14]. Among psychobiotic therapies, the administration of probiotic organisms (mostly Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains, alone or combined) has been the most tested, for example, in clinical depression [14]. In contrast, dietary therapies, either using specific dietary factors (e.g., dietary fibre supplements) or whole dietary interventions (e.g., Mediterranean diet), are much less studied in terms of their impact on the gut microbiome, at least in part, due to their methodological challenges. Compared with other psychobiotic interventions, the effect of diet is ubiquitous, extending across the entire lifespan with implications for neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration [7,13]. Therefore, modulating the microbiota–gut–brain-axis through diet is a promising approach to preventing and treating mental health disorders. However, dietary gut microbiota–target interventions are in their early stage of research. Although more randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are emerging, it is crucial to address methodological limitations inherent to dietary intervention studies and collect high-quality microbiome, brain, and behavioural data simultaneously. Thus, this opinion review will focus on recent studies that used dietary gut microbiota–target interventions, emphasizing those with behavioural data in the context of mental health. In addition, we will discuss recommendations for establishing more informative and robust dietary assessment protocols and interventions in diet–microbiome studies. 

There are many pathways through which the gut–microbiota communicates with the brain that are prone to dietary modulation [1,5,7,13,15,16▪]. Although most of this knowledge comes from preclinical studies, there is emerging interest in translating diet–microbiome–brain findings into clinical research [7,12,13,16▪]. The bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain, known as the microbiota–gut–brain-axis, comprises neuroendocrine-immune pathways [15]. The most studied microbial-derived metabolites are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs – acetate, propionate, and butyrate), resulting from microbial processing of dietary indigestible fibres [15,17]. SCFAs act on enteroendocrine L cells secreting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide Y.Y. (PYY). These anorexigenic peptides act on hypothalamic centres to control feeding behaviour and energy balance [5,15,18,19]. Additionally, bacteria-derived secondary bile acids and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can enhance GLP-1 secretion in L cells. SCFAs also have immune functions, for example, by promoting host intestinal barrier integrity (e.g., stimulation of mucus production and tight junction assembly) [15]. Other actions of SCFAs include regulating the suppression of cytokine production from myeloid cells and differentiating T regulatory and T helper cell differentiation [15].

The composition of the diet can impact these pathways through several factors [16▪] (Fig.
1). For example, a healthy diet (with varied sources of dietary fibre [20▪,21], phytochemicals [22], or live bacteria [3▪▪,23]) can promote increased microbial diversity and production of SCFA and other bioactive compounds with beneficial physiological effects from gastrointestinal and metabolic health to brain processes [3▪▪,13,16▪,20▪,21,23]. On the contrary, a western-like pattern comprising processed foods lacking the recommended quantity of dietary fibre and with higher content of saturated fats, salt and sugars can result in suboptimal gut microbiota composition and a low-grade systemic inflammation associated, for example, with mental illness, gastrointestinal pathology and metabolic disorders [11] and obesity [24,25] (Fig.
1).

Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have supported the role of the gut microbiome in mental health [9,10▪▪,11]. For example, there is evidence of a lower relative abundance of SCFA-producing genera and a higher relative abundance of lactic acid-producing bacteria genera across different psychiatric disorders [9,10▪▪]. And, increased circulating levels of the tight-junction protein zonulin, the endotoxin LPS and gut-related systemic inflammatory markers have been shown in patients with severe mental illness and chronic fatigue relative to controls [11]. In addition, recent RCTs have raised attention to the efficacy of dietary interventions in outcomes relevant to mental disorders, such as improvement of depression symptoms [3▪▪,26▪,27–29]. This section will provide a nonextensive discussion of recent findings of diet–microbiome studies, highlighting those with behavioural outcomes whenever possible.

Intermittent fasting has gained attention mainly in weight management and improved metabolic outcomes, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet clarified. The gut microbiome may have a potential role in those outcomes. However, diet–microbiome studies in humans have been limited to Ramadan fasting. For example, 1-month intermittent fasting in Ramadan induced an increased relative abundance of butyric acid-producing Lachnospiraceae and improved body mass index and blood glucose relative to nonfasting controls [40]. But, since Ramadan fasting results in decreased energy intake and a profound dietary modification [41], it does not necessarily reflect the more common intermittent fasting approaches. Energy consumption and dietary macronutrient distribution are not necessarily modified in the latter. Thus, controlled studies using fasting as an intervention are needed, accounting for energy intake, dietary composition, gut microbiota, and behavioural data.

Human studies aiming to assess diet–microbiome–behaviour effects face several levels of complexity, from intra-individual variability in the microbiome [42] to limitations inherent in diet studies (e.g., difficulty in assessing dietary intake and adherence to diet) [42]. One major challenge is the lack of standardized protocols for dietary assessment or interventions in microbiome studies [43]. This section will provide a nonexhaustive critical review of fundamental aspects for designing diet–microbiome–behaviour studies, including selecting dietary assessment methods and implementing dietary interventions.

The assessment of dietary intake in free-living settings is a major challenge in nutrition research [44], extending to diet–microbiome studies. In brief, dietary intake can be evaluated using direct methods, comprising direct observation, duplicate diets, and nutritional biomarkers [45,46]. More commonly, indirect (self-report) methods, such as food diaries (weighed or estimated), 24-h dietary recalls and Food Frequency Questionnaires (FQs) [45,46], are used due to their lower cost and burden [45]. However, all subjective techniques rely on the participant's self-report and, thus, on memory, past experiences, and perceptions [46]. Therefore, all self-report methods are prone to systematic bias and misreporting issues [44,46].

In summary, direct and self-report methods have advantages and disadvantages, and there is not a one-size fit solution for dietary assessment methods. However, according to the study design and research question, researchers can decide which instruments to include based on available toolkits (see Dao et al.[46] for details). Furthermore, in diet–microbiome–behaviour studies, nutritional biomarkers can be an asset to address food composition variability and the effects of food processing and cooking methods [44]. Although this approach needs further validation [44], it has the potential to change current dietary assessment practices. Lastly, using digital-based options is also recommended [44], mainly when the software uses validated databases and calculation methods [44].

Several aspects must be considered when designing a dietary intervention in a microbiome study. One critical question is the optimal duration of the dietary intervention [43]. Preclinical evidence showed rapid diet-induced changes in the gut–microbiome, consistent with results from different dietary interventions in humans that resulted in microbiome composition changes within days [28,50]. However, there is also evidence of gut–microbiota resilience as shown in long-term dietary interventions for weight loss [51▪]. The initial shift in the microbiota was followed by a return to baseline characteristics even though the participants maintained the prescribed diet and weight loss [51▪]. Accordingly, the length of a dietary intervention required to induce changes at the host level is suggested to be weeks or months, depending on the outcomes of interest and the study design (longer for crossover design) [43]. In addition, other factors such as baseline microbiota composition and extent of change in a dietary intervention (e.g., increasing fibre intake vs. switching to vegetarian from a meat-based diet) will probably play a role. Also, the impact of dietary interventions on the habitual diet and overall feeding behaviour in diet–microbiome studies has not been consistently assessed and reported to the best of our knowledge. For example, increasing dietary fibre intake or introducing novel foods can impact satiety and satiation [21], and thus habitual dietary intake regarding energy content and macronutrient composition. Therefore, diet–microbiome studies would benefit from assessing the participants’ baseline diet and feeding behaviour characteristics (e.g., hunger, satiety and fullness) and monitoring the relationship between these parameters throughout the follow-up.

Furthermore, participants must be willing to comply with the changes in diet that can comprise novel foods, unusual textures, cooking methods, and shopping habits. In this context, knowledge acquired from lifestyle programs (e.g., diabetes prevention) [52], including behavioural change techniques and strategies to promote engagement and attenuate retention, can be translated into diet–microbiome–behaviour studies, particularly relevant when studying individuals with mental disorders [52]. Thus, researchers must design dietary interventions, considering available resources and the specificities of the targeted population, among other relevant factors such as assessment of compliance to diet, as shown in Table
1.

Diet–microbiota–gut–brain-axis is an emerging topic with high potential application for clinical nutrition. Controlled diet–microbiome studies in humans are emerging with promising findings for brain health. However, much work is needed to address current limitations in this field. Future diet–microbiome studies will benefit from standardized methods for dietary assessment based on validated approaches but with sufficient specificity for the microbiome field. In terms of intervention studies, it is critical to determine the optimal length of dietary intervention, to test behavioural approaches to promote compliance with diet specificities and to include behavioural outcomes along with microbiome and nutritional data. Lastly, the resources required for deploying technologically assisted methodologies, including mental health populations, should be considered when designing new diet-microbiome studies.
