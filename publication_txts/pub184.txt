Effect of host breeds on gut microbiome and serum metabolome in meat rabbits

Gut microbial compositional and functional variation can affect health and production performance of farm animals. Analysing metabolites in biological samples provides information on the basic mechanisms that affect the well-being and production traits in farm animals. However, the extent to which host breeds affect the gut microbiome and serum metabolome in meat rabbits is still unknown. In this study, the differences in phylogenetic composition and functional capacities of gut microbiota in two commercial rabbit breeds Elco and Ira were determined by 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing. The alternations in serum metabolome in the two rabbit breeds were detected using ultra-performance liquid chromatography system coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS).

Sequencing results revealed that there were significant differences in the gut microbiota of the two breeds studied, suggesting that host breeds affect structure and diversity of gut microbiota. Numerous breed-associated microorganisms were identified at different taxonomic levels and most microbial taxa belonged to the families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. In particular, several short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing species including Coprococcus comes, Ruminococcus faecis, Ruminococcus callidus, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium NK4A136 could be considered as biomarkers for improving the health and production performance in meat rabbits. Additionally, gut microbial functional capacities related to bacterial chemotaxis, ABC transporters, and metabolism of different carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids varied greatly between rabbit breeds. Several fatty acids, amino acids, and organic acids in the serum were identified as breed-associated, where certain metabolites could be regarded as biomarkers correlated with the well-being and production traits of meat rabbits. Correlation analysis between breed-associated microbial species and serum metabolites revealed significant co-variations, indicating the existence of cross-talk among host-gut microbiome-serum metabolome.

Our study provides insight into how gut microbiome and serum metabolome of meat rabbits are affected by host breeds and uncovers potential biomarkers important for breed improvement of meat rabbits.

Gut microbial communities play pivotal roles in host nutrient digestion, energy harvesting, immunity modulation, and disease development [1]. Recently, compositional and functional variation in the gut microbiota has been linked to the health and production performance of farm animals [2]. Thus, understanding the mechanisms governing the maintenance and function of gut microbiota is crucial for farm animal industry. Both environmental (e.g., diet, medicine, and environmental hygiene) and host factors (e.g., genetics background, gender, and age) can shape the gut microbial communities [3]. In recent years, accumulating evidence has highlighted the variation of gut microbiome in different animal breeds fed under the same conditions. For example, Xiao et al. found that gut microbiota of Landrace and Yorkshire pigs were similar but remarkably different from that of Duroc and Hampshire pigs [4]. Pandit et al. identified several breed-specific biomarkers including the genera Clostridium, Blautia, Butyrivibrio, Ruminococcus, and Roseburia in the gut microbial communities of different broiler chicken breeds [5], while Cheng et al. observed substantial changes in the metabolic capacities of xylose, ribose, and fucose in the gut microbiome of Lantang and Duroc pigs [6].

Microbiomics and metabolomics have been effective in improving our understanding of how host breeds affect gut microbiome and metabolic profile in livestock, respectively. Nonetheless, few studies have applied a combined meta-omics approach to evaluate the role of host breeds in structuring gut microbial communities and circulating metabolic profiles, and to investigate the relationship between breed-associated microorganisms and metabolites. In the current study, we analysed the gut microbiome and serum metabolome in two commercial meat rabbit breeds (Elco and Ira), exploring the correlations between breed-associated microbial species and serum metabolites. Our findings not only provide the basic knowledge of how host breeds shape both the gut microbiome and the serum metabolome, but uncover potential biomarkers for practical applications in promoting the well-being status and production performance of meat rabbits.

To understand how host breeds affect gut microbial community structure, we performed RDA analysis, which revealed that breeds exerted a stronger effect on gut microbial communities in comparison to gender and age (Fig. 1a). The alpha diversity analysis showed that there were no significant differences in Chao1, ACE, observed species, and Good’s coverage between Elco and Ira rabbits, but Elco rabbits had significantly higher Shannon and Simpson indices than Ira rabbits (Fig.
1b and c, FDR adjusted P < 0.05). On the other hand, beta diversity analysis using both weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances indicated that Ira rabbits had higher dissimilarities among gut microbial communities than Elco rabbits (Fig.
1d, FDR adjusted P < 0.05).

The six predominant phyla in the gut microbial communities of both Elco and Ira rabbits were as follows: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, and Tenericutes (Fig. 2a). Sixteen out of nineteen most dominant genera were derived from the phylum Firmicutes, such as Ruminococcus_1, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group, and Ruminococcaceae_V9D2013_group (Fig.
2b). The other three most dominant genera were Alistipes and Bacteroides (phylum Bacteroidetes) and Akkermansia (phylum Verrucomicrobia).

Due to the limitations of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we could not identify the microorganisms at the species level. Hence, we performed LEfSe analysis using metagenomic species data. As shown in Figs. 4, 11 species, including Clostridium sp. CAG:710, Blautia sp. CAG:37, Lachnospiraceae bacterium NK4A136, Bacteroides faecichinchillae, and Ruminococcus sp. CAG:488 were more abundant in Elco rabbits, while 12 species, including Clostridium sp. CAG:1013, Bacteroides eggerthii CAG:109, Coprococcus comes, Ruminococcaceae bacterium mt9, and Lachnospiracea ebacterium ND2006 were more abundant in Ira rabbits. In consistent with the results obtained at higher taxonomic levels, we found that in both rabbit breeds most of the more abundant species (16 out of 23) were members of the family Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae.

To investigate the functional differences of the gut microbial communities between Elco and Ira rabbits, LEfSe analysis was performed using metagenomic KOs and KEGG pathways data (Fig. 5 and Additional file 2: Table S4). Twenty-four KOs were highly represented in Elco rabbits (Fig.
5a), of which most were assigned to bacterial chemotaxis (e.g., K03411, K02556, and K02410), two-component system (e.g., K02406, K07710, and K03415), pentose phosphate pathway (e.g., K00036, K00033, and K06151), fructose and mannose metabolism (e.g., K18333, K01840, and K01805), and valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation (e.g., K05606 and K18661). Meanwhile, 26 KOs were significantly enriched in Ira rabbits, most of which were related to ABC transporters system (e.g., K10188, K17235, K10190, and K02195), phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan metabolism (e.g., K01556, K00014, K04517, and K10797), galactose metabolism (e.g., K01835, K01193, and K01684), glycerolipid metabolism (e.g., K01130 and K03621), and lysine metabolism (e.g., K00658 and K00003). KEGG pathways comparison analysis indicated that eight functional categories, including primary bile acid biosynthesis, secondary bile acid biosynthesis, bacterial chemotaxis, and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, were more active in Elco rabbits. In contrast, 8 functional categories, such as, ABC transporters, lysine biosynthesis, tryptophan metabolism, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism, were more abundant in Ira rabbits (Fig.
5b).

To comprehensively understand how the serum metabolome differed between Elco and Ira rabbits, non-targeted UPLC-QTOFMS was used to characterise the serum metabolomics profiles. In total, 834 metabolite features were obtained. PLS-DA analysis using all metabolite features showed a clear difference between Elco and Ira rabbits (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). In addition, 73 significantly different metabolites were identified (FDR adjusted p < 0.05, Fig. 6a, Additional file 2: Table S5). Among these, 39 metabolites were more abundant in Elco rabbits, with 14 fatty acids and derivatives (e.g., heptadecanoic acid, erucic acid, nervonic acid, pristanic acid, phytanic acid, and pentadecanoic acid); six amino acids and derivatives (e.g., L-glutamine, glycine, L-serine, and acetylglycine); and six organic acids (e.g., 2-hydroxy-butanoic acid, 3-aminobutyric acid, glycolithocholic acid, and 4-aminobutyric acid). The other 34 metabolites were enriched in Ira rabbits, including 13 amino acids and derivatives (e.g., L-cystine, 3-methylhistidine, L-kynurenine, L-lysine, L-proline, and L-tryptophan), ten organic acids (e.g., chlorogenic acid, 3-phenylpropanoic acid, phenylacetic acid, succinate, and alpha-ketoglutarate), and two fatty acids and derivatives (2-methylglutaric acid and adipic acid).

Pathway enrichment analysis using significantly different metabolites identified 28 differentially enriched metabolic pathways in the two rabbit breeds (Fig.
6b). Several metabolic pathways of fatty acids (e.g., alpha linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolism, propanoate metabolism, bile acid biosynthesis, and oxidation of branched chain fatty acids) and amino acids (e.g., aspartate metabolism, glutamate metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation) were more activated in Elco rabbits, while in Ira rabbits amino acids metabolic pathways (e.g., histidine metabolism, glycine and serine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and tyrosine metabolism) were more activated.

To evaluate the potential relationships between breed-associated gut microbial species and serum metabolites, we performed Spearman rank correlation analysis. A total of 343 significant correlations were identified (FDR adjusted P < 0.05, Fig. 7). In Elco rabbits, ten of the most abundant species were significantly associated with at least one metabolite. Among these, Lachnospiraceae bacterium NK4A136, Bacteroides clarus CAG:160, Lachnospiraceae bacterium COE1, Ruminococcus sp. CAG:579, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium AC2031 were the predominant species, which had 110 significant associations with metabolites. Meanwhile, twenty Elco-associated metabolites showed significant associations with at least one species. Among the metabolites, taurocholate, pristanic acid, phytanic acid, heptadecanoic acid, erucic acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, linoleic acid, chenodeoxycholate, and stearidonic acid were the dominant ones, each of which was associated with at least 10 species. Twelve Ira-associated species, including Pseudobacteroides cellulosolvens, Lachnospiraceae bacterium CAG:215, Ruminococcaceae bacterium mt9, Clostridium sp. CAG:1013, and Lachnospiracea ebacterium ND2006, which totally exhibited 181 significant associations with 35 metabolites. In addition, 22 Ira-associated metabolites were significantly correlated with at least one species, including 4-hydroxycoumarin, DL-3-hydroxybutyric acid, allocystathionine, homoveratric acid, guanidoacetic acid, L-carnitine, Glu-Ser, L-lysine, 4-guanidinobutyric acid, L-cystine, L-kynurenine, p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and adenosine 3′-monophosphate, each of which was associated with more than 10 species.

Emerging evidence has linked the gut microbiome and metabolome to the health, development, and growth of farm animals [11–13]. Hence, understanding how host and environmental factors affect the gut microbiome and metabolome is beneficial to improve the well-being and production performance of animals. However, few studies have investigated the effects of host breed on the gut microbiome and metabolome of meat rabbits. Thus, we explored differences in the gut microbiome and serum metabolome of Elco and Ira rabbits and established correlations between breed-associated microbial species and serum metabolites.

Our study has limitations as we analysed only two rabbit breeds, but it provides important evidence of the effect host breeds have on the gut microbiome and serum metabolome in meat rabbits and unravels a number of microbial species and serum metabolites that could be considered as candidate biomarkers for breed improvement in meat rabbits. In this context, further studies aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms of how host breeds modeling the gut microbiome and serum metabolome are needed. In addition, future studies aiming to validate such biomarkers in a large population with multiple rabbit breeds should also be considered.

The current study provides information on the effect host breeds have on gut microbiome and serum metabolome of meat rabbits. Differences in gut microbial features (such as, diversity, microbial taxa, and functional capacities) and serum metabolites were detected between Elco and Ira rabbits. Even though such breed-associated differences constitute a small part of the complex biological processes, our study provides information that could aid future studies in determining the genetic basis of microbial and metabolome profiles variation, improving our knowledge of host-gut microbiome-serum metabolome interactions and how it influences the health and production traits of meat rabbits.

Fifteen rabbits (8 males and 7 females) with similar age (72 ± 2 days) were randomly selected from Elco and Ira breed in the rabbit farm of Wanjia Animal Husbandry Co., Ltd., Longyan, China. All rabbits were fed with the same commercial pellet diet (Additional file 2: Table S1) under the same raising environment conditions. All rabbits were healthy and had not received antibiotics, anticoccidial drugs, probiotics or prebiotics before hard fecal samples were collected. Three rabbits (2 males and 1 female) were randomly selected from each group for metagenomic sequencing and jugular vein blood collection. Blood samples were refrigerated on ice after collection for 1 h and serum was obtained by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min. All samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for transportation and stored at − 80 °C until further utilization. At the end of the study, all rabbits (80 ± 2 days) were transported to the local slaughterhouse, stunned with electronarcosis and quickly bled by cutting the jugular veins and carotid arteries.

Total genomic DNA was isolated from feces using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantity and quality of DNA was detected by using the Nanodrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. The fusion primers 341F (5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′) and 806R (5′- GGACTACHVGGGTATCTAAT-3′) were used to amplify the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene under the annealing temperature of 55 °C with 28 cycles. The products of amplification were purified, and then sequenced on Hiseq-2500 platform (Illumina, USA) according to the manufacturer’s manuals. Quality control of raw data including filter out the primers, barcodes, and low quality sequences was accomplished by QIIME (v.1.9.1) [58]. High-quality paired-end reads (quality score ≥ 20) were assembled into tags by using FLASH (v.1.2.11) [59]. To avoid potential sequencing depth bias, the library size of microbial sequences of each sample was rarefied to 40,000 tags [60]. Tags with > 97% sequence identity were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using USEARCH (v.10.0) [61]. Taxonomic category assignments of OTUs were performed by using SILVA database (v.132) [62]. The alpha and beta diversity indices were calculated using Mothur (v.1.41.1) and QIIME (v.1.9.1), respectively [58, 63].

According to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, USA), a pair-end (PE) DNA library was constructed for each sample. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina Hiseq-4000 platform. Fastp (v.0.19.4) was used to quality control, adapter trimming, and low-quality reads filtering of raw reads [64]. High quality reads were assembled into contigs by using the MEGAHIT (v.1.1.3) [65]. Open reading frames (ORF) prediction was performed using the contigs with more than 200 bp in length by MetaGeneMark (v.2.10) [66]. Cd-hit (v.4.6.1) was used to exclude the redundant genes from the predicted ORFs to construct the non-redundant gene catalogue [67]. Gene abundance was calculated by mapping the high quality reads against the non-redundant gene catalogue using MOCAT (v2.0) [68]. Taxonomic category assignments of the genes were performed by aligning against non-redundant (NR) database using DIAMOND (v.0.9.24) [69]. KEGG Orthologies (KOs) and KEGG pathways annotation information from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database were obtained by GhostKOALA [70].

Serum samples were used for untargeted metabolomics analysis by ultra-performance liquid chromatography system coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOFMS). Serum samples were preprocessed as the following modified protocol [71]. 100 μl of serum from each sample was precipitated by 300 μl methanol precooled to − 20 °C. After mixing with a vortex, all samples were incubated at − 20 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant. The supernatant (500 μl) was collected and freeze-dried for storage. The dried supernatants were resolved in 200 μl of 15% methanol (diluted by water) and transferred into the sampling vials for UPLC-QTOFMS (Waters, USA) analysis. Additionally, the quality control (QC) sample was created by mixing an aliquot of equal volume for each sample.

The raw data was processed by the Progenesis QI (Waters, USA) for peak alignment to obtain a peak list consist of the retention time, m/z, and peak area [72]. Based on retention time and the m/z data pairs, both ion intensity of each peak and a matrix consist of sample names, ion intensities, and arbitrarily assigned peak indices were obtained. The matrix was further trimmed by filtering out peaks with missing values in more than 75% of samples and those with isotope ions to obtain consistent variables. The qualified peaks were normalized to the QC sample by using support vector regression algorithm in R package MetNormalizer [73]. To assess the repeatability of metabolomic data sets, the coefficient of variation of metabolites in the QC samples was set at a threshold of 25%. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), identification of significantly different metabolites (Wilcoxon test with FDR correction), and KEGG pathways enrichment analysis was performed by using MetaboAnalyst 4.0 web server [74].

To identify the effect of host breeds, age and gender on gut microbial communities, redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed by using the vegan package in R. Wilcoxon rank sum test with false discovery rate (FDR) correction was performed to detect differences in microbial diversity indices and relative abundances of microbes at different taxonomic levels between Elco and Ira rabbits. The significant differences in relative abundances of microbial species and functional capacities between Elco and Ira rabbits were uncovered by using linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis. To make heatmap more legibility to show the differential functional features, the relative abundances were transformed to enrichment scores as previously described by Contrepois et al. [75]. Spearman rank sum correlation analysis with FDR correction was used to calculate the correlation coefficients between breed-associated species and metabolites [76]. Excepted the differential OTUs were visualized using iTOL [77], the other plots were generated in R.
