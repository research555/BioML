The relationship between the gut microbiome and host gene expression: a review

Despite the growing knowledge surrounding host–microbiome interactions, we are just beginning to understand how the gut microbiome influences—and is influenced by—host gene expression. Here, we review recent literature that intersects these two fields, summarizing themes across studies. Work in model organisms, human biopsies, and cell culture demonstrate that the gut microbiome is an important regulator of several host pathways relevant for disease, including immune development and energy metabolism, and vice versa. The gut microbiome remodels host chromatin, causes differential splicing, alters the epigenetic landscape, and directly interrupts host signaling cascades. Emerging techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing and organoid generation have the potential to refine our understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiome and host gene expression in the future. By intersecting microbiome and host gene expression, we gain a window into the physiological processes important for fostering the extensive cross-kingdom interactions and ultimately our health.

The human body plays host to large numbers of bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms—commonly referred to as the microbiota (Shreiner et al. 2015). These microbes are important to our health. They assist in establishing host immunity (Kamada et al. 2013), strengthen the gut barrier (Leclercq et al. 2014), and provide beneficial metabolites (Lukovac et al. 2014). Consequently, the microbiota is associated with a large number of complex diseases in humans, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Aleksandrova et al. 2017), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Tang et al. 2017), and colon cancer (Nelson and Chia 2019). Whether shifts in the microbiota lead to or are the cause of disease remains largely unknown. Although, it has been demonstrated that the microbiota play causal roles in several diseases, including obesity (Ridaura et al. 2014; Turnbaugh et al. 2006) and diabetes (Wen et al. 2008). Given the importance for our health, it is necessary to characterize the physiological relationships between the microbiota and human host to understand disease etiology and design therapeutics involving the microbiome.

In this review, we offer insights about the physiology of host–microbiota relationships gained by studying host gene expression jointly with the microbiome, specifically in the gut. We briefly describe the microbiome and how it is studied, synthesize themes gained through studies performed in powerful model systems and in humans, and highlight potential mechanisms through which host transcription–microbiota cross-talk occurs. Finally, we propose future directions, both experimental and analytical, that will further our understanding of how host transcription and the microbiome interact.

The relationship between the host and the gut microbiome starts at birth when the microbiome of the newborn is seeded. Delivery mode (cesarean section or vaginal delivery) plays an important role in the establishment of the microbiome (Bäckhed et al. 2015; Dominguez-Bello et al. 2010; Montoya-Williams et al. 2018; Papathoma et al. 2016). Proper nutrition and the transition from breast feeding to more solid foods results in maturation of the infant microbiome (Bäckhed et al. 2015). The establishment of the microbiome in neonates works in concert with the establishment of innate mucosal immunity, but can be disrupted by early use of antibiotics (Russell et al. 2012). The composition of the microbiome rapidly diversifies up to the age of three, steadily increases until around the age of 40, and then remains fairly stable (de la Cuesta-Zuluaga et al. 2019; Yadav et al. 2016; Yatsunenko et al. 2012). Though highly unique between individuals, the microbiome is relatively resistant to long-term changes (Bäckhed et al. 2012). The microbiome will typically return to a state of equilibrium after a stress like a dietary change, a short term adult antibiotic treatment, or an acute invasion by a pathogenic bacterium (Bäckhed et al. 2012). However, short-term modulations of the gut microbiome can interrupt normal metabolite production (Yoon and Yoon 2018). This in turn may cause changes in host gene expression that could lead to more long-lasting effects in the host.

Finally, to explore functional activity of the gut microbiome, RNA within a microbiome can be sequenced via RNA-seq (referred to as metatranscriptomics). Typically, researchers deplete ribosomal and transfer RNA experimentally to enrich for bacterial transcripts prior to sequencing, as ribosomal and transfer RNA make up approximately 95–97% of total RNA in a bacterial cell (Rosenow et al. 2001). Metatranscriptomics investigates bacterial gene expression (transcription) changes between conditions or individuals [analyzed with the program SAMSA2, for example (Westreich et al. 2018)]. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomic sequencing can be coupled with host transcriptomics to investigate how different aspects of the gut microbiome (composition, functional capacity, or functional activity) affects host gene expression and vice versa.

A powerful way to investigate both the microbiome and host transcriptomics is with model organisms, such as mice (Fig. 1), zebrafish, C. elegans or Drosophila melanogaster. With model organisms, researchers have control over the environment, complete control over diet, and, importantly, the ability to study all tissues. These aspects are either impossible or extremely difficult to do with human subjects. Organisms bred without a microbiome (e.g., germ-free mice) can be used to identify gut microbiome-mediated effects in the host organism. For example, if the effects of a treatment are lost in germ-free mice when compared to wild-type or conventionalized mice, then it can be inferred that gut microbiome plays a role in the specific effect. While powerful, there are caveats to consider when using germ-free mice. With no microbiome present, there is much thinner mucous layer in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of a germ-free mouse compared to a conventional mouse (Miyakawa et al. 1971). Barrier function is worse, and there is likely innate inflammation present in the gut (Miyakawa et al. 1971). Germ-free mice also have reduced metabolic rates and enlarged ceca (Miyakawa et al. 1971). These innate functional differences must be noted when drawing conclusions with germ-free mice.

While we highlight mouse models above, many additional organisms serve as powerful laboratory systems to reveal insights into the relationship between the microbiome and host transcription. Studies conducted in zebrafish (Murdoch and Rawls 2019), C. elegans (Dirksen et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2019), and Drosophila melanogaster (Broderick et al. 2014; Douglas 2018; Elya et al. 2016) for example, all have revealed the impact of the microbiome on immunity, metabolism, and developmental gene regulation.

Given the difficulties of studying human gene expression, far less is known about the relationship between the human microbiome and the human transcriptome. The area with the most research to date is the study of how gut pathogens influence host gene expression, either directly or indirectly through immune stimulation. One of the ways pathogens modulate host gene expression is indirectly through the activation of host microRNAs (miRNA), which are small RNA molecules (~ 20 nucleotides long) that repress transcribed mRNAs in human cells by targeting specific RNAs for degradation or inhibiting their translation (Maudet et al. 2014). Pathogenic bacteria like Listeria monocytogenes (Schnitger et al. 2011), Salmonella Typhimurium (Schulte et al. 2011) and Helicobacter pylori (Zhang et al. 2008) all stimulate host miRNAs that dampen the immune response, repress apoptotic signals, and increase autophagy to avoid host clearance (Maudet et al. 2014).

While exciting, technical limitations exist for scRNA-seq on host cells as well as for using scRNA-seq on a microbiome sample. The first hurdle of scRNA-seq is that the equipment needed for the experiments are expensive (Liu and Trapnell 2016). Additionally, the procedures used to isolate cells and their respective RNA are complicated and could introduce bias based on the enzyme treatments used. ScRNA-seq methods are most criticized for their low capture rates, meaning that sparse transcripts may be missed. When applying scRNA-seq to the microbiome, the above issues are compounded with the fact that there are thousands of species of bacteria in our gut. There has not been a method developed for using scRNA-seq specially on a microbiome sample. However, one group took existing scRNA-seq methods that address multiple species (Butler et al. 2017), zero inflation issues (Van den Berge et al. 2018) and issues with technical noise (Kharchenko et al. 2014), tested them on simulated and manually curated 16S and metagenomic microbiome data, and compared the results with existing metagenomic analysis techniques (Calgaro et al. 2020). This group concluded that there was no perfect method but existing microbiome methods like DESeq2, edgeR and corncob preformed the best when analyzing the data. The prospect of combining scRNA-seq with the microbiome is attractive, new analytical techniques will need to be implemented to deal with the complexity of both the host and the microbiome.

When investigating microbiome–host interactions in humans, researchers employ various approaches, such as collecting biopsies (taken during colonoscopies, gastric surgeries, or colonic surgeries), generating organoids, the gut on a chip model (Kim et al. 2016) or using human cell cultures (Fig. 2, Supplemental Table 1). Biopsies provide the most biologically faithful representation of host gene expression–microbiome relationships at the interface of the intestinal lumen, but suffer from the drawback that they are invasive to obtain and are difficult to maintain the features of ‘normal’ human tissue. Consequently, many profiled biopsies originate from diseased tissue, and do not offer insight into host–microbiome interactions in healthy states. In some instances, matching control samples are collected from patients with diseased or inflamed tissue (Häsler et al. 2017; Lloyd-Price et al. 2019). This matched study design allows direct comparison between “normal” and inflamed tissue, which can be a more powerful approach that takes into account host-specific factors like diet and genetics versus comparing case and control samples collected in different individuals.

Biopsies are highly invasive and expensive, and alternative strategies exist for studying the relationship between the human microbiome and transcriptome. Cell cultures are cheap, relatively easy to maintain, and can be completely controlled by the researcher. To study how the host cells and microbes interact, co-culture techniques can be employed where intestinal cells are co-cultured with fecal isolates to simulate a host–microbiome environment (Richards et al. 2016). Although an imperfect proxy, colonocyte-microbiome co-culture experiments identify thousands of genes differentially regulated in the presence of a microbiome compared to control. The differentially expressed genes in the co-culture model are significantly enriched for genes identified as differentially expressed in murine colonic epithelial cells from conventional vs. germ-free mice, demonstrating the biological utility of the model.

It is clear from the many studies in model organisms and humans that there is an association between the gut microbiome and gene expression in the host. In many cases, it is unclear what the direction of causality is with these associations, however. Does a change in microbiome composition cause changes in host gene expression, or does a change in host gene expression change microbiome composition (Fig. 3)? Deciphering this relationship is important for understanding disease etiology and ultimately designing therapeutics that target the microbiome.

Conversely, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the gut microbiota provide evidence that gene expression likely influences the abundance of certain bacteria in the gut (Blekhman et al. 2015; Bonder et al. 2016; Davenport 2016; Goodrich et al. 2016; Goodrich et al. 2017; Turpin et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2017). In particular, taxa such as Christensenellaceae, Akkermansia, and Bifidobacterium are either heritable or associated with genetic variation in the human genome. As it is expected that an individual’s genome sequence will not change in the presence of the microbiome, these studies demonstrate that host genetics, likely via gene regulation, modulates aspects of the gut microbiome.

Many molecular mechanisms foster the cross-talk between the microbiome and host gene expression (Fig. 4). Transcription factors are host proteins that bind to DNA and regulate the transcription of genes. Elements of the microbiome bind directly to transcription factors (Davison et al. 2017; Krautkramer et al. 2017). In zebrafish, the microbiome suppresses the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4α), preventing the regulation of host inflammatory pathways, potentially leading to an inflammatory state (Davison et al. 2017). Studies on the skin microbiome of mice showed that colonization of the skin microbiome regulates the expression of several key transcription factors (Klf4, AP-1 and SP-1), albeit via an unknown mechanism (Meisel et al. 2018).

Finally, the gut microbiome also has a role in the alternative splicing of host genes (Martínez-Montiel et al. 2016) (Fig. 4c). Products from Pseudomonas sp (FR901464) and Streptomyces sp (pladienolide) inhibit host splicing machinery (Fan et al. 2011). Additionally, 320 differential splicing events in intestinal tissue occurred between patients with IBD and healthy controls, after controlling for tissue type, inflammation status, and diagnosis. (Häsler et al. 2017). The alternative splicing events upregulated in IBD patients were mapped to the KEGG pathways for ‘bacterial invasion of epithelial cells’, ‘pathogenic E. coli infection’ and ‘allograft rejection’. It should be noted that there was only a weak correlation between host gene expression and the shared alternative splicing events. Research into the relationship between alternative splicing and the microbiome remains scarce and should be considered in future studies, considering the major role splicing plays in complex disease etiology (Li et al. 2016).

The complexity of the interactions between the microbes in the gut and the host is immense. Although recent studies in model organisms and humans demonstrate that trans-kingdom crosstalk occurs, there are still many avenues to explore to gain further insight into host–microbiome interactions. Many existing studies identify individual bacteria associated with host gene expression. While this can occur, other effects are likely driven by a variety of taxa, due to functional redundancy. There are thousands of bacterial species present in the gut microbiome. Many different species share genes and pathways to produce the same metabolites (Moya and Ferrer 2016). Therefore, it is important to understand how the functional capability of the gut microbiome changes, in addition to shifts in taxonomy (Blakeley-Ruiz et al. 2019; Schirmer et al. 2019). Bacterial metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics can be used to investigate the functional potential of the gut microbiome. Future studies that combine metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and 16S sequencing with metabolomics and RNAseq of host tissue may be able to reveal more insights about how microbiome functions interact with host gene expression.

The study of the relationship between the microbiome and host gene expression has already yielded great insights into the physiological mechanisms that link a host with the microbes that live within it. With the exponential growth of sequencing techniques and technologies, new cell culture techniques, the growing popularity of scRNA-seq, and the advent of more advanced statistical methods, we are currently poised to gain even greater insight into the trans-kingdom relationship we have with our microbiome.
