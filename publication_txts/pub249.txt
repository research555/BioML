Investigating the Role of Diet and Exercise in Gut Microbe-Host Cometabolism



We investigated the individual and combined effects of diet and physical exercise on metabolism and the gut microbiome to establish how these lifestyle factors influence host-microbiome cometabolism. Urinary and fecal samples were collected from athletes and less active controls. Individuals were further classified according to an objective dietary assessment score of adherence to healthy dietary habits according to WHO guidelines, calculated from their proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) urinary profiles. Subsequent models were generated comparing extremes of dietary habits, exercise, and the combined effect of both. Differences in metabolic phenotypes and gut microbiome profiles between the two groups were assessed. Each of the models pertaining to diet healthiness, physical exercise, or a combination of both displayed a metabolic and functional microbial signature, with a significant proportion of the metabolites identified as discriminating between the various pairwise comparisons resulting from gut microbe-host cometabolism. Microbial diversity was associated with a combination of high adherence to healthy dietary habits and exercise and was correlated with a distinct array of microbially derived metabolites, including markers of proteolytic activity. Improved control of dietary confounders, through the use of an objective dietary assessment score, has uncovered further insights into the complex, multifactorial relationship between diet, exercise, the gut microbiome, and metabolism. Furthermore, the observation of higher proteolytic activity associated with higher microbial diversity indicates that increased microbial diversity may confer deleterious as well as beneficial effects on the host.

IMPORTANCE Improved control of dietary confounders, through the use of an objective dietary assessment score, has uncovered further insights into the complex, multifactorial relationship between diet, exercise, the gut microbiome, and metabolism. Each of the models pertaining to diet healthiness, physical exercise, or a combination of both, displayed a distinct metabolic and functional microbial signature. A significant proportion of the metabolites identified as discriminating between the various pairwise comparisons result from gut microbe-host cometabolism, and the identified interactions have expanded current knowledge in this area. Furthermore, although increased microbial diversity has previously been linked with health, our observation of higher microbial diversity being associated with increased proteolytic activity indicates that it may confer deleterious as well as beneficial effects on the host.

Recent studies have shown that increased physical activity and aerobic fitness may mediate some health benefits through modulation of the gut microbiome (1,–4). Human studies have shown differences in the gut microbiome, including increased diversity, in both habitual exercisers (5, 6) and professional athletes (7,–10) compared to more sedentary controls. Longitudinal studies have also found exercise-dependent compositional and functional changes in the gut microbiome that result in altered levels of a number of microbially derived bioactive metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) as well as improved glucose homeostasis (7, 11, 12).

However, understanding the relationship between the gut microbiome, diet, and exercise remains elusive in part because of the dietary adaptations that accompany habitual physical activity. Difficulties understanding this relationship are compounded by inaccuracies in assessing dietary habits, with 30 to 88% misreporting using traditional self-reported assessment tools (13,–15). In an earlier report, taxonomic and functional diversity were positively correlated with both dietary protein intake and physical exercise in a population of athletes (7, 8). We hypothesized that more accurate dietary assessment would help separate the contributions of diet and exercise to the modulation of the gut microbiota and enhance our understanding of the contribution of diet and exercise to the modulation of microbe-host cometabolism. To achieve this, we applied metabolic profiling combined with a mathematical modeling strategy to provide objective evidence of adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) healthy eating guidelines (increased fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dietary fiber and decreased fats, sugars, and salt) (16, 17). Our approach characterizes volunteers more accurately according to physical activity and dietary status. By minimizing dietary variation in volunteer subsets the study has uncovered insights into the distinct influences of physical activity and dietary status on host metabolism, the gut microbiome, and subsequent gut microbiome-host cometabolism. In addition, we have explored the functional and metabolic implications of higher microbial diversity, previously reported in athletes (7, 8), on the host.

To assess the separate contributions of diet and exercise in modulating the gut microbiota, we investigated urine and fecal samples from male athletes (n = 40) in the national Irish Rugby Football team that were collected while attending an intensive training camp and healthy controls (n = 46) matched for age and gender, as previously described (8). We used a previously validated, metabolic profiling dietary assessment tool (17) to objectively assess and score participants’ dietary habits (Fig. 1). Higher calculated scores indicate more complete adherence to WHO dietary guidelines of increased fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dietary fiber and decreased fat, sugar, and salt consumption. Briefly, the dietary profiling model was built using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) global urinary metabolic profiles derived from healthy participants that attended an inpatient randomized controlled crossover trial and were assigned to diets with differing levels of adherence to WHO healthy eating guidelines (16, 17) (see Materials and Methods).

As expected, controls had diverse adherence to a healthy diet, while professional athletes were predominantly assigned scores that met or exceeded the healthy eating guidelines with healthy eating scores of ≥100%, reflecting the known association between habitual exercise and good dietary habits (18). The scores for healthy eating behavior for the less active control participants ranged from 12.8% to 112.2%, with a relatively even distribution between the two extremes, while those of the athletes ranged from 15.7% to 112.5%, with only 5 of the 40 professional athlete participants falling below the 100% boundary. Individuals were then stratified according to their score to construct comparative groups (Fig. 1). Participants with a scored adherence to WHO healthy eating guidelines of ≥100% were considered healthy eaters. A cluster of controls was observed with a healthy eating adherence score of <35%. There is evidence that those at the bottom third of a healthy eating scale have a 25% higher all-cause mortality than those in the top third, as well as a 40% higher mortality from cardiovascular disease (19). Therefore, 35% was chosen as the cutoff to define unhealthy eaters. We used these groupings to construct a variety of models to statistically measure the differences in host metabolism, the gut microbiome, and their subsequent cometabolism between various groups (Fig. 1). Model 1 (healthy diet effect) was constructed comparing controls with a <35% adherence (n = 19) versus controls with a ≥100% adherence to healthy eating (n = 11); model 2 (exercise effect) compared controls with a ≥100% adherence to healthy eating (n = 11) versus athletes with a ≥100% adherence to healthy eating (n = 35); model 3 (combined healthy diet and exercise effect) compared controls with a <35% adherence to healthy eating (n = 19) versus athletes with a ≥100% adherence to healthy eating (n = 35). Other lifestyle factors, including smoking levels and alcohol consumption, were also measured. The were no significant differences in these factors between groups.

Based on these comparative groups, six statistically robust Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) models (Fig. 2A to
F) were obtained to assess the effects of diet, exercise, and the two in combination on participants’ urinary and fecal metabolic profiles, measured by 1H-NMR. The urinary model characterizing the combined effect of diet healthiness and exercise was strongest (model 3; Fig. 2C, R2Y = 0.94, Q2Y = 0.74), but statistically robust urinary models were also obtained defining the impact of diet healthiness (model 1; Fig. 2A, R2Y = 0.97, Q2Y = 0.55) and exercise alone (model 2; Fig. 2B, R2Y = 0.92, Q2Y = 0.45). With regard to fecal profiles, the strongest model was that defining the effect of exercise (model 2; Fig. 2E, R2Y = 0.92, Q2Y = 0.45). The combination of diet healthiness and exercise produced a relatively robust model (model 3; Fig. 2F, R2Y = 0.91, Q2Y = 0.39), while investigation of diet alone showed the least impact (model 1; Fig. 2D, R2Y = 0.95, Q2Y = 0.21).

Targeted analysis of 10 organic acids in urine by GC-MS demonstrated lower levels of lactate (pFDR = 0.002) and 2-hydroxybutyrate (pFDR = 0.014) in healthy eating controls versus controls with unhealthy eating habits (model 1, healthy diet effect). 2-Methylbutyrate (pFDR = 0.043) was lower in healthy eating athletes versus healthy eating controls (model 2, exercise effect). In contrast to the fecal SCFA model, urinary acetate (pFDR = 0.006), propionate (pFDR = 0.003), 2-methylbutyrate (pFDR = 0.001), isovalerate (pFDR = 0.001), and lactate (pFDR < 0.001) were all lower in athletes with ≥100% adherence to healthy eating versus controls with <35% adherence to healthy eating (model 3, combined effect).

No difference in gut microbial diversity was found between comparative groups when investigating the effect of healthy eating (model 1; Fig. 2J) or exercise (Model 2; Fig. 2K). However, there was increased diversity of genera detected by 16S profiling in healthy eating athletes versus unhealthy eating controls, both in richness and evenness (model 3; Fig. 2L, combined effect) using Shannon (pFDR = 0.012), Simpson (pFDR = 0.020), whole-tree (phylogenic diversity [PD]; pFDR = 0.001), Chao1 (pFDR = 0.025), and observed feature (pFDR = 0.012) indices. Similar comparisons for each of the models with microbial metabolic pathways, species, and genera identified with metagenomic sequencing were not significantly different despite having similar trends (data not shown).

Linear regression analysis of 1H-NMR fecal water global profiles against Shannon, Simpson, and PD diversity indices, corrected for confounding factors (age, lean mass, and fat mass), revealed multiple metabolites associated with diversity (see Table S2). In contrast, no metabolites from urinary 1H-NMR global profiles were found to significantly correlate with measures of gut diversity. Fecal metabolites associated with higher diversity included increased short/medium-chain FAs valerate and caproate; branched SCFAs isobutyrate, isovalerate, and 2-methylbutyrate; branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation products 2-oxoisocaproate and 2-oxoisovalerate; as well as products of phenylalanine (phenylacetate and 3-phenylpropionate), choline (dimethylamine), proline (2-methylproline), and uracil (ureidopropionate) metabolism. Increased diversity was also associated with lower glucose, isoleucine, asparagine, and histidine levels. See Table S2 for corrected P values (pFDR).

A total of 47 fecal and 27 urinary metabolites of interest were subsequently quantified. Selection of these metabolites was based on discriminatory capacity (model weighting) from models 1 to 3 and/or metabolites associated with microbial diversity. A number of correlation matrices were generated using these quantified metabolites to explore gut metabolome-host metabolome interactions. First, fecal-urinary metabolome interactions were derived from Spearman correlations between the two data sets (see Fig. 3). Findings included the correlation of urinary 3IS with fecal SCFAs, urinary PAG with fecal phenylacetate, urinary hippurate with fecal 3-phenylpropionate, and urinary TMAO with fecal trimethylamine and methylamine. Second, Spearman correlations between metabolite levels and relative abundance of (i) microbial species (Fig. S1) and (ii) microbial metabolic pathways (Fig. 4) were explored, revealing numerous significant correlations (pFDR < 0.01 = 257 and 58 correlations, respectively). These included the correlation of urinary PAG levels with bacterial species from the Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria phyla as well as a number of bacterial metabolic pathways, including those related to gluconeogenesis, anaerobic energy metabolism, and glutamate degradation to SCFAs. We found a number of positive correlations between bacterial species and pathways with SCFAs, including the correlation of acetate with Roseburia hominis, Streptococcus suis, and Halobacteriovorax marinus, propionate with Leuconostoc citreum, and valerate with Pyrococcus horikoshii, Simkania negevensis, and Streptococcus suis. We identified a large number of species and pathways whose abundance correlated with fecal dimethylamine (DMA) excretion but which did not appear to influence TMAO levels. Whereas the heterofermentative lactic acid bacterium Leuconostoc citreum did correlate with higher TMAO levels. Interestingly, we also identified a number of lactococcal phages that correlated with TMAO. Furthermore, lactococcal phage levels correlated with increased TMAO:DMA and TMA:DMA ratios. Further correlations between dietary, metabolite, microbial pathway, and microbial diversity data sets were also performed (Fig. S2 to S5). Fecal butyrate correlated strongly with fiber intake, whereas propionate correlated most strongly with protein intake. Diversity was correlated with a number of metabolites, including valerate, medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA), branched SCFA, and branched-chain keto acids (BCKA), as well as lower amino acid levels. Increased diversity also correlated with a number of microbial pathways, including higher amino acid, BCAA, and nicotinate degradation, cofactor and amino acid biosynthesis, and gluconeogenesis pathways, along with a reduced activity in starch degradation, methionine, and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways.

Models of diet healthiness, exercise, or both each displayed metabolic and functional microbial signatures, with a number of discriminatory metabolites. Microbial diversity was associated with a combination of increased diet healthiness and exercise and also correlated with distinct microbially derived metabolites. Our results suggest that dietary changes alone did not significantly impact bacterial diversity, although they did affect gut microbial metabolites in urine and feces.

As expected, the effect of adherence to WHO healthy eating guidelines was associated with higher markers of fruit and vegetable intake (urinary proline-betaine, formate, and hippurate in addition to lower sugar levels) (17, 22). Healthy eating was also characterized by lower urinary levels of lactate and 2-hydroxybutyrate, markers of anaerobic respiration and oxidative stress, respectively (22).

High levels of physical activity were linked with higher concentrations of O-acetyl carnitine, a metabolite associated with the intake of animal protein. Although protein consumption was higher in the athlete group and included whey protein supplementation in several individuals, higher O-acetyl carnitine may also have been due to increased fatty acid mobilization and oxidation (23). In addition, there were lower concentrations of urinary succinate in athletes, likely due to increased systemic utilization through the TCA cycle.

Tryptophan metabolism. In control participants assigned high healthy eating scores (model 1), we found lower levels of N-methylnicotinamide (NMND). NMND is generated from tryptophan metabolism through the kynurenine pathway in humans. The resulting nicotinamide is methylated by nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), to form NMND, which is then further metabolized to 2-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2PY) (24). Nicotinamide serves an important role in energy regulation. Indeed, NNMT knockout in mice—resulting in higher nicotinamide and reduced NMND and 2PY—is protective of diet-induced obesity (25). Thus, the lower levels of NMND seen here suggest increased energy expenditure in healthy eaters.

In addition, SCFAs can also be utilized by bacteria for de novo amino acid biosynthesis (44). Here, increased fecal valerate correlated with increased exercise (models 2 and 3) and microbial diversity and was positively correlated with bacterial phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis pathways (Fig. 4). Furthermore, increased fecal acetate also correlated with increased exercise (models 2 and 3) and was positively correlated with bacterial tryptophan biosynthesis pathways. Lastly, fecal acetate and valerate were positively associated with guanosine ribonucleotide biosynthesis pathways. These correlations suggest that SCFAs have an important role in enabling the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds.

We have shown that each exercise/diet group exhibited a distinct metabolic and functional microbial phenotype. The incorporation of an objective measure of dietary habits into the models enabled us to more accurately reduce the confounding effect of diet when investigating exercise and therefore better ascertain the individual biological sequelae of diet healthiness and exercise. Limiting the participants to males removed confounders resulting from gender. However, further studies are needed to confirm the reproducibility of these results in females. In addition, we were unable to isolate the effect of diet in participants with high physical activity levels due to a paucity of athletes that follow an unhealthy diet.

Although increased microbial diversity has previously been linked with health (45,–48), increased diversity in the present cohort was associated with amplified proteolytic fermentation by gut bacteria. Since protein metabolism within the gut has been linked with the production of toxic compounds such as ammonia, amines, and sulfides (49, 50), increased gut bacterial diversity may include deleterious as well as beneficial effects on the host. This emphasizes the value of in-depth analysis at a metabolic pathway and taxonomic level in future microbiome studies.

Professional male athletes from the national Irish Rugby Football team (n = 40) and healthy controls (n = 46) matched for age and gender were enrolled in this study as previously described (8). Exclusion criteria included receiving antibiotics within 2 months before screening and prior diagnosis with any cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or immunological condition. Control subgroups were established with body mass index (BMI) ranges matching the body types of the athletes. Approval was granted by the Cork Clinical Research Ethics Committee. Urine and fecal samples were collected from both groups and stored at −80°C until analysis.

Urine and fecal samples were collected from athletes while they attended an intensive training camp and from healthy but less active controls. Activity levels were validated using the EPIC-Norfolk questionnaire (51) and creatine kinase levels. Dietary intake was calculated from food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) administered by a research nutritionist (8).

As determined previously, 16S taxonomic profiles had more robust characterization of taxa at and above the level of genus (7). Due to the removal of samples falling outside healthy diet thresholds, species and strain-level designations were unreliably varied within the study groups. As a result, the 16S data were used in order to more conservatively represent alpha diversity above the species level, whereas metagenomic sequencing was used to establish species and pathway data.

Extraction and purification of DNA from fresh fecal samples were accomplished with the QIAmp DNA stool minikit (Qiagen, UK). The manufacturer’s protocol for the extraction kit was followed with the addition of a bead-beating step (30s × 3) to better disrupt cell walls. The resulting DNA was initially stored at −20°C prior to 16S rRNA sequencing before being stored at −80°C until the samples were prepared for shotgun metagenomics sequencing.

The complete procedures used for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing were outlined previously (8). Briefly, 16S rRNA gene (v4) PCR amplicons were generated using a combination of universal 16S rRNA primers estimated to bind to 94.6% of all 16S genes. Sample-specific identifier tags and 454 adaptor sequences were combined with the primers. The AMPure magnetic bead purification system was used to clean both 16S amplicons and shotgun metagenomics libraries (Beckman Coulter; catalogue number 9A63880). The 16S amplicons were sequenced on a 454 genome sequencer FLX platform at the Teagasc sequencing facility using the manufacturer’s protocols. The 16S sequencing data were originally processed accordingly as follows: quality trimming of raw 16S sequences was done with the Qiime (v1.2) (52) software suite, using the SILVA 16S rRNA database (v106) (53). Reads were discarded from further analysis if they fell below a minimum quality score of 25 or were shorter than 150 bp. BLAST with default parameters was used with the SILVA database to generate input for MEtaGenome ANalyzer (MEGAN v4.70.4), which assigned reads to taxonomies. Following read clustering to operational taxonomical units (OTUs) and chimaera removal, Qiime was then used to generate measures of alpha diversity. Although the methods to process 16S sequencing data are continuously evolving, minimal changes have occurred with OTU assignment and the calculation of alpha diversity measures. Due to this, diversity indices as previously reported were used to describe alpha diversity above the species level (8).

As described previously (7), metagenomic library preparation was performed with the Illumina Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit (Illumina, Inc., USA) in explicit accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol (15031942, Illumina). Prior to library preparation, DNA samples were normalized to 0.2 ng/μl using the Qubit v2.0 fluorometric quantification system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Library fragment size was assessed with the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies; catalogue number G2939BA). Finalized libraries were combined in equimolar concentration (2 nM) before sequencing. Metagenomic libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 (chemistry v4.0) next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform by Eurofins Genetic Services Ltd. (Ebersberg, Germany) using the high-output run mode for 2 × 125-bp paired-end reads with the addition of a PhiX library (1%) to estimate sequence quality. Contaminant reads from humans were removed from raw FASTQ sequence files with NCBI Best Match Tagger (BMTagger) software. Remaining reads were quality checked with Picard and SAMTools software, removing duplicate and substandard-quality reads. The resulting high-quality sequence data were subjected to functional profiling by the Human Microbiome Project Unified Metabolic Analysis Network (HUMAnN2 v.0.5.0) pipeline (54). Here, models of microbial metabolic pathways derived from the MetaCyc database were generated. Metagenomic taxonomic profiling was performed with the Kraken software package (v0.10.6) (55). Species-level shotgun metagenomics data were converted to relative abundance, and HUMAnN2 pathway profiles were normalized to copies per million units prior to statistical analysis.

Metabolic analyses of urine and fecal biofluids were conducted using established 1H-NMR and GC-MS methods (56, 57), as previously described (7).

Urinary and fecal quality control samples were used for the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and GC-MS analyses to ensure data quality.

We applied a novel and validated mathematical tool capable of objectively assessing free-living individuals’ dietary patterns based on their urine composition, without the need to collect dietary data. The tool is based on a Monte Carlo cross-validated PLS-DA model built from global urinary metabolic profiles derived from a highly controlled environment (inpatient randomized controlled crossover trial) to ensure that healthy participants were fully adherent to four dietary interventions that reflected four different levels of adherence (25, 50, 75, and 100%) to WHO healthy eating recommendations (increased fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dietary fiber and decreased fats, sugars, and salt) (17). The application of this model has been successfully validated in free-living populations (17, 59). 1H-NMR urinary metabolic profiles from athletes and controls were projected into the MCCV-PLS-DA model to calculate a predicted score for each participant that reflected their adherence to healthy eating. We considered a score that is predicted at 100% or higher to be reflective of healthy eating; e.g., the global profile of such a score has (on average) higher concentrations of biomarkers reflective of the 100% diet than trial participants following the 100% diet.

Based on the self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), there were no significant differences in the frequency of citrus fruit or fruit and vegetable consumption comparing controls with a ≤35% adherence to healthy eating versus controls with a ≥100% adherence to healthy eating (citrus consumption, P = 0.96; fruits and vegetables, P = 0.67) or controls with a ≤35% adherence to healthy eating versus athletes with a ≥100% adherence to healthy eating (citrus consumption, P = 0.85; fruits and vegetables, P = 0.77).

However, we and others have demonstrated the use of urinary biomarkers to independently assess the consumption of specific food groups, including proline-betaine for citrus fruits (20, 60) and hippurate for fruits and vegetables (31, 61). Investigation of urinary proline-betaine and hippurate found higher intake of citrus and fruits and vegetables in the healthy eating athletes and controls. This suggests a level of misreporting in the self-reported data that makes it difficult to interpret. Therefore, participants’ dietary intakes were scored using the validated metabolic profiling dietary assessment tool that relies on urinary metabolic profiles and dietary biomarkers instead of self-reported FFQ (17).

1H-NMR spectra were phased and digitized over the range δ0 · 5 to 9 · 5 and imported into MATLAB to undergo median fold change normalization (62). Multivariate statistical analysis was performed using SIMCA v14.1 (Umetrics) (62). The three comparative groups previously defined were modeled using OPLS-DA: (i) controls with a <35% adherence to healthy eating versus controls with a ≥100% adherence to healthy eating (model 1), (ii) controls with a ≥100% adherence to healthy eating versus athletes with a ≥100% adherence to healthy eating (model 2), and (iii) controls with a <35% adherence to healthy eating versus athletes with a ≥100% adherence to healthy eating (model 3). The OPLS-DA models were established based on one predictive component and one orthogonal component. Unit variance scaling was applied to 1H-NMR spectral data. The fit and predictability of the models obtained were determined by the R2Y and Q2Y values, respectively. Significant metabolites differentiating between groups were obtained from 1H-NMR OPLS-DA models after investigating 1H-NMR signals with correlation coefficient values higher than 0.4. Jack-knifed 95% confidence intervals of the coefficients were used to confirm the significance of the variables.

Finally, heat maps showing significant Spearman correlations between data sets were generated using the ComplexHeatmap script in R (63). Spearman correlations were first calculated in MATLAB. Correlations between metabolite-metabolite data sets with a pFDR <0.05 were included. Due to the large number of variables, a false-discovery rate of 1% was set for correlations, including microbiome taxa and pathway data sets. Hierarchical clustering of correlations was performed using Euclidean distances.

A combination of data-driven strategies such as such as SubseT Optimization by Reference Matching (STORM) (64) and Statistical TOtal Correlation SpectroscopY (STOCSY) (65) and analytical identification strategies were used to aid structural identification of significant discriminatory metabolites. Specifically, a catalogue of 1D 1H-NMR sequences with water presaturation and 2D NMR experiments such as J-Resolved spectroscopy, 1H-1H TOtal Correlation SpectroscopY (TOCSY), 1H-1H COrrelation SpectroscopY (COSY), 1H-13C Hetero-nuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) and 1H-13C Hetero-nuclear Multiple-Bond Correlation (HMBC) spectroscopy were performed. Finally, when possible, metabolites were confirmed by in situ spiking experiments using authentic chemical standards.

Semiquantification of identified metabolites from 1H-NMR profiles was performed using an in-house MATLAB script to annotate maximal intensity of median fold change normalized spectral peaks. The highest-intensity spectral peak was identified for each measured metabolite and precisely quantified for each individual. Manual annotation enabled precise marking of peaks, allowing for variations in chemical shift in individual samples. Where spectral peaks overlapped with other metabolites, the highest-intensity unambiguous spectral region was used.

All presented data are tabulated and detailed in the main text and supporting information. Codes used to analyze these data are referenced in the main text. Metagenomic sequencing data are available at the European Nucleotide Archive repository (accession number PRJEB15388). The 16S rRNA sequence reads are available from the Sequence Read Archive (accession number PRJEB4609).
