A fiber-deprived diet causes cognitive impairment and hippocampal microglia-mediated synaptic loss through the gut microbiota and metabolites

Cognitive impairment, an increasing mental health issue, is a core feature of the aging brain and neurodegenerative diseases. Industrialized nations especially, have experienced a marked decrease in dietary fiber intake, but the potential mechanism linking low fiber intake and cognitive impairment is poorly understood. Emerging research reported that the diversity of gut microbiota in Western populations is significantly reduced. However, it is unknown whether a fiber-deficient diet (which alters gut microbiota) could impair cognition and brain functional elements through the gut-brain axis.

In this study, a mouse model of long-term (15 weeks) dietary fiber deficiency (FD) was used to mimic a sustained low fiber intake in humans. We found that FD mice showed impaired cognition, including deficits in object location memory, temporal order memory, and the ability to perform daily living activities. The hippocampal synaptic ultrastructure was damaged in FD mice, characterized by widened synaptic clefts and thinned postsynaptic densities. A hippocampal proteomic analysis further identified a deficit of CaMKIId and its associated synaptic proteins (including GAP43 and SV2C) in the FD mice, along with neuroinflammation and microglial engulfment of synapses. The FD mice also exhibited gut microbiota dysbiosis (decreased Bacteroidetes and increased Proteobacteria), which was significantly associated with the cognitive deficits. Of note, a rapid differentiating microbiota change was observed in the mice with a short-term FD diet (7 days) before cognitive impairment, highlighting a possible causal impact of the gut microbiota profile on cognitive outcomes. Moreover, the FD diet compromised the intestinal barrier and reduced short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. We exploit these findings for SCFA receptor knockout mice and oral SCFA supplementation that verified SCFA playing a critical role linking the altered gut microbiota and cognitive impairment.

This study, for the first time, reports that a fiber-deprived diet leads to cognitive impairment through altering the gut microbiota-hippocampal axis, which is pathologically distinct from normal brain aging. These findings alert the adverse impact of dietary fiber deficiency on brain function, and highlight an increase in fiber intake as a nutritional strategy to reduce the risk of developing diet-associated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD, the most prevalent form of dementia), have devastating impacts on the individual affected, their families, and health and social care systems [1]. Epidemiological evidence suggests that unhealthy diets and lifestyle factors can increase the risk of developing AD [2, 3]. The Lancet commission concluded that 40% of dementia cases could be prevented by addressing modifiable risk factors, including diet [1]. A global diet survey showed that the majority of adults have a severely deficient dietary fiber intake. For example, the average fiber intake per person is about 15 g/day in the USA [4], 13.6 g/day in the UK [5], and 11 g/day in China [6]. This is significantly lower than the 25–35 g/day of fiber intake, which is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). A strong link, however, is yet to be established between low dietary fiber intake and an increased risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases.

Here, for the first time, we determined the effects of dietary fiber deficiency on cognition using a mouse model of chronic dietary fiber deficiency (FD), which mimics a sustained low fiber intake in humans. The synaptic ultrastructure, proteome profiles, and microglial-neuroinflammation-synapse pathway were examined in the hippocampus, as were measurements of gut homeostasis (including gut microbiota profiles, colonic mucosa, and the epithelium barrier, as well as serum SCFAs and LPS). Furthermore, to establish a causal association between fiber deficiency-induced gut dyshomeostasis and cognitive decline, the microbiota-gut-brain axis was also examined within a short-term version of the fiber deficiency mouse model. Finally, to assess a potential role of SCFAs (metabolites of fiber fermentation by gut microbiota) in mediating gut-brain dysfunction, the parameters of the gut-brain axis were examined in SCFA receptor knockout (GPR41−/− and GPR43−/−) mice, and also in mice with SCFA supplementation in a fiber-deficient diet.

After 15 weeks of the FD diet, mice showed significant cognitive deficits, including impaired object location memory, temporal order memory, and the ability to perform activities of daily living (Fig. 1A–F). Both the place discrimination index in the object location test and temporal order discrimination index in the temporal order memory test were significantly decreased in FD mice compared with the control mice (p < 0.05, Fig. 1A–D). The difference in object location and temporal order memory between the FD and control group was not due to the variability in general activity since the total exploration time of objects during the testing phase was comparable between the two groups (Figure S1A and B). The FD group displayed a decreased ability to build a nest in the nesting behavior test, as these mice had a higher untorn nestlet weight and lower deacon nest score than that of the controls (both p < 0.05, Fig. 1E, F and Figure S1C). Plasticity of synaptic ultrastructure in the hippocampus is required for cognition [17]. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the synaptic ultrastructure of the CA1 region of the hippocampus was altered in FD mice. The synaptic clefts were widened, and the postsynaptic densities were thinned in the FD mice (both p < 0.05, Fig. 1G–I). Furthermore, the presynaptic and postsynaptic markers, synaptophysin (SYN), and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), were reduced in the FD group (both p < 0.05, Fig. 1J, K). In addition, the energy intake, body weight and adipose tissues weight were higher in the FD group compared with the control group after 15 weeks (Figure S1D-F).

To identify hippocampal synaptic proteins involved in fiber deficiency-induced cognitive impairment, we compared the hippocampal proteomic profiling between the FD and the control mice using mass-spectrometry-based proteomics analysis. There were 68 downregulated proteins and 92 upregulated proteins in the FD group (Fig.
2A). The GO analysis was used to determine the top 10 biological processes relevant to these proteins (Fig.
2B). These include the G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, cell development, anterograde trans-synapse signaling, regulation of cellular amine metabolic process, and trans-synaptic signaling. The altered proteins were further analyzed using KEGG pathways and assigned into down-regulated synaptogenesis pathways, including cholinergic synapses, dopaminergic synapses, cell adhesion molecules, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) synapses, neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interactions (all p < 0.05, Fig.
2C). With respect to the upregulated pathways, KEGG pathway analysis showed ECM-receptor interaction, advanced glycation end product and their receptors (AGE-RAGE) signaling pathway in diabetics, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, the phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway, African trypanosomiasis, and Epstein Barr-virus infection (all p < 0.05, Fig.
2C).

Thirty-one proteins within synaptogenesis pathways were differentially expressed in the hippocampus between the FD and the control mice (Fig.
2D). Altered synaptic proteins induced by the FD diet were mapped onto the protein-protein interactions (PPI) network (Fig.
2E). The PPI network indicated that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CaMKIId or CaMK2d) is a core node between the cholinergic synapse and dopaminergic synapse pathways. CaMKIId directly interacted with adenylate cyclase 5 (ADCY5), solute carrier family 6 member 3 (SLC6A3), G protein subunit gamma 4 (GNG4), and choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) within the two synapse pathways as well as other synaptic proteins, such as A-kinase anchoring protein 5 (AKAP5) (a postsynaptic scaffold protein) and actin (ACTN)2 (which mediates spine morphology and assembly of the postsynaptic density). CaMKIId also interacted indirectly with some proteins involved in synaptic plasticity and cognitive function, such as growth-associated protein (GAP)43 (a crucial component of the axon and presynaptic terminals) and synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2V (SV2C) (a membrane glycoprotein localized to synaptic vesicles). These two synaptic proteins are also reduced in dementia patients [18]. Next, the significant variants detected in the proteomic analysis were verified in the hippocampus using immunoblot. We found that the levels of CaMKIId, GAP43, and SV2C proteins were decreased in the hippocampus of FD groups compared to control animals (p < 0.05, Fig. 2F–H). Overall, the proteomics results suggest that the dysregulation of CaMKIId and its associated synaptic proteins contributes to fiber deficiency-induced synaptic and cognitive impairments.

To address how microglia cells modulate synaptic connectivity, we characterized the morphology of microglia and investigated microglia-synaptic engulfment in FD mice. By immunofluorescent staining with the Iba1 antibody (a microglia-specific calcium-binding protein), we found increased microglia cell number, enlarged microglial cell bodies, and fewer microglial branches in the hippocampal CA1, CA3, and DG regions (Fig. 3A, B), as well as increased Iba1 protein levels (p < 0.05, Fig.
3C) in FD mice. Sholl analysis of Iba1+ cells revealed increased activated microglia in the FD group, evidenced by an increased circularity index and decreased ramification index (both p < 0.05, Fig. 3D, E). Furthermore, we found that the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β were increased in the hippocampus of FD mice (all p < 0.05, Fig.
3F), indicating pro-inflammatory M1 activation. The immunofluorescence intensity of CD68 (phagocytic marker) was upregulated in the microglia of the FD group (Fig.
3G) with increased mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus (both p < 0.05, Fig. 3H, I). There were increased PSD-positive puncta enveloped by microglia in the FD group (Fig.
3J), suggesting that dietary fiber deficiency activated microglia and induced the engulfment of synapses in the hippocampus. Following this observation of fiber deficiency-induced neuroinflammation, we found that FD mice had increased protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) (p < 0.05, Fig.
3K), an important mediator which crosslinks inflammation to synaptic alterations [19, 20]. PTP1B can inhibit CaMKII activation [21] and impair the pCaMKII-pGSK3β synaptogenesis pathway resulting in Tau phosphorylation, a critical mark in several neurodegenerative diseases [22–24]. Consistent with these findings, we observed that dietary fiber deficiency decreased levels of pCaMKII and pGSK3β (both p < 0.05, Fig. 3L, M) and upregulated pTau (p < 0.05, Fig.
3N). Collectively, these findings indicate that fiber deficiency induces microglia activation-mediated synaptic engulfment with alterations of synaptic signaling molecules in the hippocampus.

Gut homeostasis is important for brain function [11, 12]. We examined whether fiber deficiency perturbed intestinal homeostasis, including intestine barrier integrity, permeability, inflammation, and gut microbiota. Using Alcian blue-staining, we found that the thickness of the colonic mucus was decreased in the FD group compared with the control group (p < 0.05, Fig. 4A, B), which was confirmed by the staining of MUC2, the inner layer of mucus (Fig.
4C). Furthermore, the mRNA expression of antimicrobial peptides, Reg3γ, was decreased in the colon tissue of the FD group (p < 0.05, Fig.
4D). The distance from microbiota to the epithelial cells was shorter in the FD group (Fig.
4E), indicating bacterial aggregation and mucus invasion. Also, the FD mice showed lower levels of epithelial tight junction proteins, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) (both p < 0.05, Fig.
4F) and higher levels of fecal albumin and serum LPS (both p < 0.05, Fig. 4G, H), indicating impaired epithelial barrier integrity and increased gut permeability. Moreover, intestinal inflammation and systemic inflammation were increased in the FD group, as there was an increase in TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β mRNA expression in the colon (all p < 0.05, Figure S1G) and in the serum of FD mice (all p < 0.05, Figure S1H). The length of the colon was reduced after the FD diet (Fig.
4I).

Next, gut microbiota diversity and composition in response to fiber deficiency were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The principal component analysis (PCoA) showed relatively separated distribution profiles, suggesting an apparent difference in β-diversity for the microbial community between the FD and the control group (Fig.
4J). In α-diversity, fiber deficiency significantly decreased species richness estimates in Chao1, Ace, and Sob indexes (all p < 0.05, Figure S2A-C) but not species diversity in Shannon index (Figure S2D). At the phylum level, the gut microbiota of both control and FD mice was mainly composed of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria (Fig.
4K). Bacteroidetes were significantly reduced in the FD mice compared with the control group, while Proteobacteria were increased (both p < 0.05, Fig.
4L). Using linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis, we identified that the lower taxa bacteria of phylum Bacteroidetes were also decreased, including class Bacteroidia, order Bacteroidales, family S24-7 and genus Prevotella (Fig.
4M and Figure S2E). However, FD mice had increased enrichment of the lower taxa of Proteobacteria, including class Deltaproteobacteria, order Desulfovibrionales and Xanthomonadales, family Desulfovibrionaceae and Xanthomonadaceae, and genera Bilophila and Stenotrophomonas (Fig.
4M and Figure S2E). In addition, we found that these altered microbiota within Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phylum were significantly linked with cognitive indexes in object location, temporal order and nesting behavioral tests (Fig.
4M). These results strongly suggest host-specific alterations of gut microbiota in Bacteroidetes phylum and Proteobacteria phylum are the hallmark of the fiber deficiency mice with cognition decline. Furthermore, using KEGG annotation and functional enrichment, we identified 18 functional categories that exhibited different enrichment levels between the FD and control groups (Figure S2F). The function associated with oxidative phosphorylation was reduced in the FD group (Fig.
4N). The KEGG pathway analysis also indicated that the perturbed gut microbiota by fiber deficiency diet was associated with decreased microbial metabolic capacity (Figure S2F), including folate biosynthesis, one carbon pool by folate, the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids and the peroxisome, which are involved in the development and function of the nervous system [25–29].

To investigate whether gut alteration induced by fiber deficiency preceded the cognition changes, we analyzed gut microbiota and other colon parameters, and the cognitive behaviors of mice with short-term fiber deficiency (FD-ST) for 7 days. We found significant differences in gut microbial profile (Fig.
5A) and species richness (Chao1, Ace, and Sob index) (all p < 0.05, Fig. 5B–D) between FD-ST and the control group, but not in species diversity (Shannon index) (Fig.
5E). Furthermore, the short-term FD diet robustly decreased Bacteroidetes phylum and increased the Proteobacteria in statistical trend (Fig. 5F, G) with 11 functional orthologs were altered (Figure S3A). Interestingly, we found short-term fiber deficiency impaired the intestinal mucosa barrier as evidenced by the decreased thickness of colonic mucus stained by Alcian blue and MUC2 antibody (Fig. 5H–J), but did not change colon tight junctions and inflammatory markers (Figure S3B-H). Finally, a short-term FD diet did not alter cognitive behaviors (Fig. 5K–N) and body weight (Figure S3J), but significantly increased energy intake (Figure S3I). Therefore, short-term fiber deficiency alters gut homeostasis, including the microbiota and colon mucus barriers, prior to alterations in cognitive function.

SCFAs are important metabolites of dietary fiber fermentation by gut microbiota [30]. Here, we found that serum concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate were all decreased by 60–70% in FD mice compared with the control mice (all p < 0.05, Fig. 6A–C). To determine the role of SCFAs in FD diet-increased intestinal permeability, we employed SCFAs receptor knockout mice, GPR41−/− and GPR43−/− mice. These mice exhibited decreased levels of tight junction proteins, ZO-1 and occludin, in the colon tissue (all p < 0.05, Fig.
6D). Furthermore, the cognitive index was decreased in object location, temporal order memory, and nesting behavioral tests of GPR41−/− and GPR43−/− mice (Fig. 6E–G, Figure S4A-C) with lower levels of synaptic proteins pCaMKII and SYN in the hippocampus (Fig. 6H, I). Therefore, fiber deficiency-induced SCFAs deficit and inactivation of SCFA receptors may serve as mediating factors between intestinal dysfunction and cognitive impairment.

To determine whether the decreased levels of SCFAs could be attributed to alterations of the gut-brain axis following fiber deficiency, we treated FD mice with SCFAs (FDS) for 15 weeks. Supplementation with SCFAs significantly increased object location memory, temporal order memory, and the ability to build a nest when compared to the FD group without SCFA supplementation (all p < 0.05, Fig. 6J–L and Figure S5A-C). SCFAs restored the FD-diet induced loss of synaptic proteins SYN and PSD95 in the hippocampus (Fig. 6M, N). Furthermore, supplementation with SCFAs inhibited the microglia activation (Figure S5D-H), phagocytosis of microglia to the synapse (Figure S5I-K), and neuroinflammation (Figure
6O), otherwise evident in FD mice. Also, SCFAs partially restored the reduction in the thickness of colonic mucus (Fig. 6P, Q; Figure S6A and B) and improved colonic antimicrobial properties (Fig.
6R), epithelial tight junctions (Fig.
6S) and permeability (Figure S6C and D), and colonic and systemic inflammation (Figure S6E-G) compared with FD mice. These findings indicate that supplementation with SCFAs prevents the gut-brain axis dysfunction induced by a fiber-deficient diet.

People in industrialized nations currently consume approximately half the recommended amount of dietary fiber [4–6]. However, the ways in which the brain is affected by fiber deficiency remains wholly understudied. In the present study, we provided the first evidence that dietary fiber deficiency leads to cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, we demonstrate in mice that this is associated with alterations of hippocampal synaptic ultrastructure and proteomic profiles (including dysregulation of the CaMKIId interacted synaptic proteins) and neuroinflammation-mediated synaptic loss. The FD mice also exhibited gut dyshomeostasis, including mucosa barrier impairment and microbiota dysbiosis (disturbances of the phylum Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria). In addition, the deficit of the intestinal mucus barrier and microbial deviation from the normal state occurred prior to the cognitive decline, suggesting the earlier response of gut dyshomeostasis to fiber deficiency. Notably, the deficit of SCFAs (metabolites of fiber by gut microbiota) was involved in mediating the gut-brain dysfunction in FD mice; SCFA supplementation prevented the leaky gut and cognitive decline of FD mice and the SCFA receptor knockout (GPR41−/−, 43−/−) mice showed abnormal gut-hippocampal synaptic axis.

Research showed that consumption of 11% sucrose solution for 4 weeks did not increase neuroinflammation in rats [74], while a prolonged high sucrose intake (5% sucrose solution) for 12 weeks provoked systemic and neuroinflammation in rats [75]. In addition, Hsu’s study showed that high sucrose intake for 4 weeks moderately impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory in adolescent rats [74]. Similarly, our short-term study with FD diet for 7 days did not show changes in cognitive function, suggesting that high content of sucrose in the FD diet did not acutely decrease the cognition. Therefore, these findings indicate that sucrose-induced neuroinflammation and cognition alteration were chronic effects. Again, in the present study, after the chronic FD diet for 15 weeks, the mice had cognition decline, neuroinflammation and microglial engulfment of synapses in the hippocampus. Furthermore, gut microbiota dysbiosis (decreased Bacteroidetes and increased Proteobacteria) were significantly associated with the impaired cognitive behaviors of FD mice. Overall, these findings indicate that sucrose as simple carbohydrates in the fiber deficiency diet contributed to gut dyshomeostasis initially and thereafter systemic neuroinflammation and cognition impairment.

The present study identified a robust phenotype of cognitive decline in a mouse model of chronic dietary fiber deficiency featuring an altered gut-hippocampal axis. Notably, the gut microbiota dysbiosis and the reduction of SCFAs suggest an interplay between dietary fiber deficiency and host gut-brain axis alteration (Fig.
7). Our findings indicate an adverse impact of dietary fiber deficiency on brain function and highlight a nutritional strategy of increased fiber intake to reduce the risk of diet-associated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.

Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J male mice (10 weeks old) were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Xuzhou Medical University (SCXK_Su_2015-0009). The GPR41−/−, and GPR43−/− mice and their littermates were obtained by intercrossing GPR41+/− and GPR43+/− mice (GPR41+/−, C57BL/6J–Gpr41/BRL, Stock No. KO-0005; GPR43+/−, C57BL/6J–Gpr43/BRL, Stock No. KO-0006; Shanghai Bioray Laboratories Inc., China). The mice were housed in environmentally controlled conditions (temperature 22 °C, 12-h light/dark cycle). After acclimatization to the laboratory conditions for 1 week, the mice were used for experiments approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee of Xuzhou Medical University following the Chinese Council on Animal Care Guidelines.

C57BL/6J male mice (11 weeks old) were randomly divided into two groups (n = 30 per group) fed either the control (Con) diet (LabDiet 5010) or fiber deficiency (FD) diet. Each group of mice was sacrificed at two-time points: 15 weeks (long-term) or 7 days (short-term) (n = 15 per subgroup). The Con diet is a plant polysaccharide-rich diet containing the microbiota-accessible carbohydrate derived from a diverse source of plants, including corn, soybean, wheat, oats, alfalfa, and beet. The reported neutral and acid detergent fiber content of the Con diet is 20% by weight. The FD diet is a low microbiota-accessible carbohydrate diet modified based on Harlan TD.86489, as described previously [46]. The FD diet contains cellulose (5% by weight, low accessibility by gut microbiota) and non-microbiota accessible carbohydrates such as sucrose (31% by weight) and corn starch (31% by weight) (detailed in table S1).

GPR41−/−, GPR43−/− mice and WT littermates (n = 8–10) were fed the Con diet for 26 weeks, so the mice were sacrificed at the same age as the mice in the long-term dietary fiber deficiency experiment.

The C57BL/6J mice (11 weeks old) were randomly divided into three groups (n = 15 per group): (1) the Con diet group, (2) the FD diet group, (3) the SCFAs (FDS) group consuming FD diet and drinking the water with the cocktail of SCFAs mixture (67.5 mM sodium acetate, 40 mM sodium butyrate, and 25.9 mM sodium propionate) [11, 76] for 15 weeks.

After the intervention in the above three experiments, cognitive behavior tests were performed. After 3 days following the last test, the mice were sacrificed using CO2 asphyxiation. Blood, cecum content, colon, and brain tissues were immediately collected for further investigations.

Mouse hippocampus was ground by liquid nitrogen into cell powder and processed with protein extraction, trypsin digestion, labeling, high-performance liquid chromatography fractionation, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The resulting LC-MS/MS data were processed using the Mascot search engine (v.2.3.0). Bioinformatics for the result of proteomic was performed including, Gene Ontology (GO) proteome annotation using the UniProt-GOA database (www. http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/); The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis according to the KEGG website (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). All protein name identifiers were searched against the STRING database (https://stringdb.org/, v.10.5) for protein-protein interactions (PPI).

The microbiomes were analyzed at the Illumina sequencing platform by Genedenovo Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). High-quality reads for bioinformatics analysis were selected, and all of the valid reads from all samples were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97% sequence similarity. The variation between the experimental groups (β-diversity) was assessed with principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plots. Linear discriminant analysis coupled with effect size (LEfSe) was performed with LEFSE software.

Frozen brain (hippocampus) sections in 20 μm were incubated with the primary antibodies, including antibody against Iba1, CD68, and PSD95, followed by the incubation with the secondary antibodies and DAPI. The microglia labeled by Iba1 and CD68 were imaged with a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS IX51). The sections double-labeled for Iba1 and PSD95 were visualized by a 63× oil immersion objective in stacks (z-step 0.1 μm) using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope system (Leica, Germany).

The colon samples were embedded in paraffin, cut into thin sections (5 μm), and performed by Alcian blue staining as previously published [73]. The mucus thickness was then measured (10 measurements per section/2 sections per animal/5 animals per group) using ImageJ after cross-validation using anti-MUC2 staining. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to stain bacteria localization at the intestinal mucosa surface as previously described [77].

Data were analyzed using the statistical package SPSS (Version 20, Chicago, USA). After data were tested for normality, the Student’s t test was used to compare two groups. For the comparisons of more than two groups, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by the post hoc Tukey-Kramer test for multiple comparisons. A p value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. An α level of 0.05 (two-tailed) was set for significance. The value was considered as an outlier if it had more than two standard deviations from the mean. Sample size, number of replicates, and statistical tests are reported in the “Additional files” section or figure legends.
