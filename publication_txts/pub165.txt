Through the Looking-Glass: Psychoneuroimmunology and the Microbiome-Gut-Brain Axis in the Modern Antiretroviral Therapy Era

Depression, substance use disorders, and other neuropsychiatric comorbidities are common in people with HIV (PWH), but the underlying mechanisms are not sufficiently understood. HIV-induced damage to the gastrointestinal tract potentiates residual immune dysregulation in PWH receiving effective antiretroviral therapy. However, few studies among PWH have examined the relevance of microbiome-gut-brain axis: bidirectional crosstalk between the gastrointestinal tract, immune system, and central nervous system.

A narrative review was conducted to integrate findings from 159 articles relevant to psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) and microbiome-gut-brain axis research in PWH.

Early PNI studies demonstrated that neuroendocrine signaling via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system could partially account for the associations of psychological factors with clinical HIV progression. This review highlights the need for PNI studies examining the mechanistic relevance of the gut microbiota for residual immune dysregulation, tryptophan catabolism, and oxytocin release as key biological determinants of neuropsychiatric comorbidities in PWH (i.e., body-to-mind pathways). It also underscores the continued relevance of neuroendocrine signaling via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, autonomic nervous system, and oxytocin release in modifying microbiome-gut-brain axis functioning (i.e., mind-to-body pathways).

Advancing our understanding of PNI and microbiome-gut-brain axis pathways relevant to depression, substance use disorders, and other neuropsychiatric comorbidities in PWH can guide the development of novel biobehavioral interventions to optimize health outcomes. Recommendations are provided for biobehavioral and neurobehavioral research investigating bidirectional PNI and microbiome-gut-brain axis pathways among PWH in the modern antiretroviral therapy era.

The central nervous system, neuroendocrine signaling, and the immune system dynamically interact in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pathogenesis (1). Even before the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) research uncovered neuroendocrine mechanisms whereby psychological factors influence clinical HIV progression (2,3). In the HAART era (i.e., 1997–2006), the associations of psychological factors with HIV disease markers and clinical HIV progression often persisted after adjusting for medication adherence (4–6). Although informative, HAART-era studies mostly examined neuroendocrine mechanisms linking psychological factors with HIV pathogenesis (i.e., mind-to-body pathways whereby mental health and stress influenced HIV disease markers). Relatively few studies characterized the pathways whereby HIV-associated pathophysiologic alterations amplify the risk of depression, substance use disorders, and other neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e., body-to-mind pathways) (7). This unidirectional approach diminished our ability to test integrated models to guide the development of biobehavioral treatments for these prevalent comorbidities among people with HIV (PWH) (8,9).

The overarching goal of this narrative review is to provide a framework to guide PNI research in the modern ART era with a focus on microbiome-gut-brain axis interactions. There are new opportunities to investigate the potentially bidirectional mechanisms linking depression, substance use disorders, and other neuropsychiatric comorbidities with HIV-associated pathophysiologic alterations that persist despite effective ART (23,24). To accomplish this goal, we first examine seminal PNI studies conducted through the HAART era. Many studies yielded provocative, mechanistic results that can guide PNI research examining the role of neuroendocrine signaling in the reciprocal interactions between gastrointestinal tract (and its resident microorganisms), immune system, and central nervous system, which will be referred to as the microbiome-gut-brain axis. We step “through the looking-glass” to envision a new generation of PNI studies that leverage our conceptual model of the microbiome-gut-brain axis in PWH receiving effective ART. This narrative review concludes with recommendations for a PNI research agenda to investigate the bidirectional pathways linking the microbiome-gut-brain axis and neuropsychiatric comorbidities in PWH.

PNI studies conducted through the HAART era delineated neuroendocrine mechanisms whereby psychological factors are linked to clinical HIV progression. There was convergent evidence from multiple cohort studies that trauma, stress, and depression predict faster clinical HIV progression (6). On the other hand, positive psychological factors such as positive affect, finding meaning, and spirituality predicted slower clinical HIV progression (4). These effects are thought to be partially attributable to alterations in neuroendocrine signaling, with a primary focus on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and autonomic nervous system activation.

These well-characterized mechanisms will continue to guide the scientific premise of PNI research, and there are four important opportunities for building upon these seminal PNI studies in the modern ART era. First, substantial advances in our understanding of HIV-associated pathophysiologic alterations can guide efforts to characterize the complex, bidirectional connections between neuroendocrine signaling and the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Second, it is unclear to what extent neuroendocrine signaling will continue to influence HIV pathogenesis in the modern ART era. Third, findings from SIV studies underscore the need for more robust efforts in human studies to characterize the relevance of social adversity, which is only beginning to be examined in PNI research conducted in PWH. Fourth, many PNI studies used stringent inclusion criteria that increased scientific rigor at the expense of generalizability (e.g., conducted mostly in sexual minority men, excluded substance users). Studies are needed to characterize the relevance of PNI mechanisms in more representative samples of PWH in the modern ART era.

In the sections hereinafter, we review evidence supporting a microbiome-gut-brain axis model relevant to depression, substance use disorders, and other neuropsychiatric disorders in PWH (Figure
1). We begin by providing an overview of what is known about the composition of the gut microbiota in PWH and the relevance of modifiable factors like stimulant use on microbiota composition and function. This section also highlights the importance of direct vagal afferent communication between the gut microbiota and the brain in modifying oxytocin release, mood, and behaviors relevant to depression and substance use disorders. Next, we describe the importance of persistent gut-immune dysregulation in PWH with a focus on indirect, immune-mediated pathways that could account for microbiome-gut-brain axis interactions. Then, we present findings regarding the relevance of peripheral immune dysregulation for depression in PWH and how this may be amplified by experiences relevant to social adversity. Finally, we briefly review evidence suggesting that neuroendocrine signaling can modify the microbiome-gut-brain axis in the modern ART era.

The gut microbiota include trillions of bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses (39,40). These microorganisms play a vital role in maintaining neuroimmune homeostasis and are associated with health outcomes, including HIV disease progression (39–43). Most research has focused on bacteria, which can influence neural, endocrine, and immune cells in the gut, periphery, and brain through the release of bacterial metabolites or via direct contact of bacteria (or bacterial products) with host cells (40,41,43). This can lead to chronic peripheral and neuroinflammation, dysregulated neurotransmitter synthesis, and altered afferent vagal nerve stimulation. In addition, gut bacteria can influence intestinal permeability, impact blood-brain-barrier integrity, modify nutrient absorption, alter the growth of pathogenic bacteria, and take part in drug metabolism, all of which are relevant to neuroimmune functioning among PWH (40–44). Many of these pathways whereby gut microbiota could potentiate depression, substance use disorders, and other neuropsychiatric comorbidities that compromise HIV disease management remain largely unexamined.

PWH show differences in the composition and function of the gut microbiota compared with people without HIV (42,45). Microbiome alterations are more prominent among untreated PWH, but disruptions persist despite effective ART (45). The gut microbiome generally shows a pattern of decreased community diversity (46–49) as well as enrichment of bacterial taxa linked to inflammation, microbial translocation, and poor CD4+ T-cell restoration. There is also evidence of depletion of bacterial taxa that are inversely associated with these markers (49,50). In addition to the role of HIV infection in altering the gut environment, the gut microbiome can be modified by a variety of behavioral and psychological factors, but studies in PWH are generally lacking or correlative. For example, stimulant use and alcohol use are associated with altered gut microbiota among PWH (51,52). There is also increasing interest in the mechanisms whereby microbiome-related alterations in reward processing influence the maintenance and severity of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders (53). Further research is needed to characterize the bidirectional microbiome-gut-brain axis mechanisms relevant to problematic patterns of alcohol or other substance use among PWH.

The vagus nerve innervates the gut, providing bidirectional (80% afferent, 20% efferent) communication with the central nervous system. Vagal tone is essential for decreasing gut permeability so that microbial products like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) do not leak into the periphery to amplify residual immune dysregulation. A recent study of PWH who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms observed that vagal dysfunction was associated with bacterial outgrowth in the small intestines that was, in turn, linked to greater systemic inflammation (54). Efferent vagal pathways that are modulated by decreases in depressive symptoms have the potential to alter the gut microbiota and decrease microbial translocation, as evidenced by the effects of vagal stimulation (55,56). Prior clinical research in people without HIV observed that increased vagal tone is an important indicator of a favorable response to cognitive-behavioral treatments for depression (57,58). PWH may also experience autonomic neuropathy (59), which is linked to vagal dysfunction and microbiome-gut-brain axis alterations.

Gut microbiota can also modulate mood and behaviors by altering stimulation of the vagal nerve. For example, gut bacteria release metabolites (or induce host cells to release metabolites) that stimulate the vagal nerve afferents that alter hypothalamic function (60) to promote the release of oxytocin (a neuropeptide that influences social behavior, metabolism, and wound healing) in the brain. In fact, Lactobacillus reuteri have been shown to activate vagal afferents to potentiate oxytocin release from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (61). This process promotes the coordinated activity of oxytocin and serotonin in the nucleus accumbens to increase the experience of social reward (62), which could have important implications for anhedonia, a common symptom of many neuropsychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders and depression (63). Although oxytocin has not been extensively examined among PWH, there is some evidence of nonlinear associations in PNI studies (64). Higher oxytocin levels have been associated with more severe depressive symptoms in PWH (17), potentially reflecting a compensatory response to depressive symptoms. In another cross-sectional study, the association of elevated stress with lower CD4+ T-cell count was observed only at higher levels of oxytocin among low-income ethnic minority women with HIV (65). There is a clear need for microbiome-gut-brain axis studies to understand the relevance of oxytocin in context of other important neuroimmune pathways among PWH.

Damage to the gut during acute HIV is thought to be a primary driver of alterations in gut microbiota (66), expansion of the enteric virome (67), depletion of CD4+ T cells (68), and increased gut permeability (66,68,69). Most notably, there is a preferential depletion of T-helper 17 cells (Th17) cells that are essential for maintaining gut barrier integrity (70), and this is currently irreversible unless ART is initiated early in acute HIV infection (71). Further research is needed to understand how key alterations to microbiome-gut-brain axis pathways could amplify the risk of persistent neuropsychiatric comorbidities during acute HIV infection and after suppressive ART.

The role of the gut microbiota in influencing gut-immune dysregulation may also amplify neuropsychiatric comorbidities beyond substance use and depression, such as cognitive impairment. PWH show a decrease in bacterial production of neuroprotective short-chain fatty acids and other neuroactive metabolites, as well as concomitant increases in tryptophan catabolism, immune activation, and inflammation secondary to microbial translocation as noted previously (42,89,99–102). These mechanisms can potentiate the production of neurotoxic metabolites, increase permeability of the blood-brain barrier, and stimulate immune cells to transport HIV across the blood-brain barrier (43,103,104). In PWH, markers of microbial translocation (e.g., LPS), monocyte activation, changes in gut microbiota composition (e.g., alteration in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroides), and heightened IDO-1 activity have been associated with cognitive impairment and morphological brain changes (103–107). An extensive review of microbiome-gut-brain axis mechanisms relevant to cognitive impairment among PWH has been published elsewhere (43).

Even with long-term effective ART, PWH experience persistent residual immune dysregulation, leading to faster onset and greater severity of age-related diseases (24). Specifically, elevated immune activation, inflammation, and coagulation in those receiving effective ART are associated with a spectrum of comorbidities that are not related to AIDS, including cardiovascular disease (108,109), cognitive impairment (110,111), metabolic disorders (112), and cancer (24). The clinical relevance of residual immune dysregulation is supported by the fact that HIV-associated non-AIDS conditions occur at younger ages with more severe health implications (109). Residual immune dysregulation could also have important consequences for the development and maintenance of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression.

There is increasing evidence that CMV reactivation is another important driver of residual immune dysregulation in the modern ART era (120–122). CMV infection activates a variety of innate and adaptive cell types including monocytes, macrophages, and CD4+, and CD8+ T cells with high levels of viral replication in select mucosal sites including the gut (120). In the modern ART era, immunologic measures of CMV and Epstein-Barr virus reactivation are independently linked to HIV-associated non-AIDS conditions such as myocardial infarction (123), and CMV-induced immunologic alterations are thought to potentiate accelerated aging in PWH (124). Among PWH receiving effective ART, latently infected T cells maintain the HIV reservoir via several mechanisms including T-cell proliferation (125). Impaired ability to control CMV infection could be a primary driver of cytokine and chemokine overflow that fuel immune activation and immunosenescence of T cells to maintain the HIV reservoir (126). PNI studies conducted in the modern ART era are needed to examine the bidirectional pathways linking asymptomatic CMV reactivation, residual immune dysregulation, and psychological factors.

PWH experience social adversity stemming from developmental vulnerabilities as well as intersectional stigma and discrimination that could amplify the risk of neuropsychiatric comorbidities via alterations in the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Many PWH experience early life stress that serves as a risk factor for developmental trajectories that increase vulnerability to HIV and could create fundamentally different set points in neuroendocrine signaling (127). Developmental vulnerabilities (128) as well as intersectional stigma and discrimination related to HIV and other minoritized identities (e.g., racial/ethnic minority, sexual minority, or gender minority) may have important health consequences (129,130).

The field of social genomics provides opportunities to examine the epigenetic mechanisms whereby the HPA axis and the autonomic nervous system could influence residual immune dysregulation in the modern ART era. The conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) is a validated profile of leukocyte gene expression reflecting upregulated expression of genes involved in inflammation as well as downregulated expression of genes involved with type I interferon (a cytokine involved in antiviral and antitumor responses) and antibody synthesis (131). Psychosocial challenges such as experiences of discrimination have been associated with a higher CTRA, irrespective of HIV status (132). This observation is consistent with findings where homophobic victimization was associated with a higher CTRA among sexual minority men without HIV (133). Interestingly, methamphetamine use and intimate partner violence are associated with upregulation of the inflammatory genes as well as upregulation of the type I interferon and antibody synthesis genes among sexual minority men with HIV (134). The upregulation of type I interferon and antibody synthesis genes may be driven in part by active viremia in this study. These findings are further supported by cross-sectional studies documenting the associations of sexual minority stress and recent stimulant use with alterations in gene expression patterns relevant to immune activation and inflammation in methamphetamine-using sexual minority men with HIV who were virally suppressed (135,136). More comprehensive, longitudinal studies are needed to understand how social adversity and stimulant use alter the transcriptional regulation of leukocytes among PWH.

Seminal PNI studies provided support for the role of neuroendocrine signaling in altered immune function among PWH. In the modern ART era, PNI studies should expand our understanding of the relevance of the complex, bidirectional interactions of catecholamines, cortisol, and oxytocin with gut microbiota. These neuroendocrine signaling mechanisms for the biologically plausible effects of depression and other neuropsychiatric comorbidities on the microbiome-gut-brain axis in PWH are described briefly hereinafter. Experimental studies are needed to understand whether and how interventions to reduce depression and substance use influence the microbiome-gut-brain axis via alterations in these distinct neuroendocrine signaling pathways.

There is also increasing evidence that oxytocin release in the brain can modify microbiome-gut-brain axis function (151). For example, one recent experimental study with rats observed that intracisternal injection of oxytocin decreased microbial translocation because of LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, these effects of oxytocin on decreased microbial translocation were blocked by vagotomy, which underscores the central importance of efferent vagal communication with the gut (152). There is also experimental evidence in rats that oxytocin could mitigate the effects of stress on gastric emptying and motility (153). Finally, findings from human studies indicate that oxytocin may play an important role in the enteric nervous system of the gut. This is partially supported by findings from biopsies of the gastrointestinal tract where oxytocin was expressed in the myenteric and submucous ganglia and nerve fibers (154). Further research in PWH is needed to determine whether and how increases in oxytocin could modify the microbiome-gut-brain axis.

Modern PNI studies are needed to determine how several, interrelated HIV-associated pathophysiologic alterations could amplify the risk of neuropsychiatric comorbidities among PWH receiving effective ART. Drawing upon our conceptual model (Figure
1), delineating the mechanisms whereby alterations in gut microbiota influence neural signaling (e.g., the vagus nerve), alter tryptophan catabolism and other neuroactive metabolites, and indirectly impact immune dysregulation in treated HIV is essential to catalyze the development of tailored pharmacologic treatments for depression, substance use disorders, and other neuropsychiatric disorders among PWH. On the other hand, neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression could also potentiate alterations in the microbiome-gut-brain axis via the HPA axis, autonomic nervous system, and oxytocin release. PNI studies are needed to examine how alterations in these neuroendocrine signaling pathways could modify microbiome-gut-brain axis pathways relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders and health outcomes in PWH. More robust efforts are needed to embrace experimental rigor by testing the mechanisms whereby biomedical (e.g., vagal stimulation, probiotics) or behavioral interventions (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) modify microbiome-gut-brain axis pathways relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders. Other experimental, laboratory-based paradigms such as reactivity studies using either pharmacologic (e.g., hydrocortisone, intranasal oxytocin), psychosocial (e.g., Trier Social Stress Test), or physical (e.g., cold pressor task) probes could also yield important mechanistic insights into acute changes in key biological processes relevant to the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Bearing in mind that the experience of social evaluative threat is more closely linked to the HPA axis response (155), further research is needed to advance our understanding of the biobehavioral implications of social adversity across the life course for the microbiome-gut-brain axis among PWH.

In summary, the modern ART era provides several opportunities to build a robust portfolio of research examining the role of microbiome-gut-brain axis in neuropsychiatric comorbidities. The central importance of HIV-induced damage to the gut and alterations in gut microbiota have enduring consequences for the mental and physical health of PWH. Interrogating these microbiome-gut-brain axis mechanisms could assist with identifying novel targets for biobehavioral interventions to address prevalent neuropsychiatric comorbidities among PWH such as depressive disorders and stimulant use disorders. This is essential to alleviate human suffering related to neuropsychiatric disorders and optimize the ability of many PWH to derive maximum benefits from ART. In Lewis Carol’s Through the Looking-Glass, Alice steps once again into a fantastical world, much like the possibilities of PNI and microbiome-gut-brain axis research in the modern ART era.
