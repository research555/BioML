Alterations of the human gut microbiome in multiple sclerosis



The gut microbiome plays an important role in immune function and has been implicated in several autoimmune disorders. Here we use 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate the gut microbiome in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS, n=60) and healthy controls (n=43). Microbiome alterations in MS include increases in Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia and decreases in Butyricimonas, and correlate with variations in the expression of genes involved in dendritic cell maturation, interferon signalling and NF-kB signalling pathways in circulating T cells and monocytes. Patients on disease-modifying treatment show increased abundances of Prevotella and Sutterella, and decreased Sarcina, compared with untreated patients. MS patients of a second cohort show elevated breath methane compared with controls, consistent with our observation of increased gut Methanobrevibacter in MS in the first cohort. Further study is required to assess whether the observed alterations in the gut microbiome play a role in, or are a consequence of, MS pathogenesis.

Microorganisms in the human gut encompass hundreds to thousands of bacterial, archaeal, viral and fungal species, making the human intestinal lumen a rich and dense source of antigenic diversity1. The gut mucosal immune system samples and processes these microbial antigens, potentially driving the expansion of particular immune subsets or generating specific immune repertoires2. Thus, the intestinal microbiome is an important entity within the host that influences immune responses both locally and systemically.

Given the importance of the gut microbiome in immune function and autoimmune disease, for the present work we investigated the human gut microbiome in multiple sclerosis (MS). We identify alterations in the intestinal microbiota and find correlations with MS-associated immune changes and treatment. If further studies demonstrate that these candidate microorganisms play an active role in either contributing to or ameliorating MS, then there is the potential to develop new diagnostics and therapies to combat the disease.

Faecal samples were collected from 60 MS patients and 43 healthy controls (Fig. 1); details of the study population are provided in Table 1 and in Methods. The MS and control cohorts had comparable demographic characteristics except that the MS cohort had an increased proportion of males. All MS patients had relapsing–remitting disease but none had an active relapse at the time of study enrollment.

Microbial DNA was extracted from faecal samples and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on the Roche 454 and Illumina MiSeq platforms using primers targeting the V3–5 or the V4 variable regions, respectively. We used two sequencing platforms to avoid platform-specific biases and to provide complementary information: the Roche 454 platform produces longer sequencing reads but fewer reads, whereas the Illumina MiSeq provides shorter reads but greater sequencing depth. The resulting sequences were then processed using the mothur software package for quality filtering, removal of artifacts and clustering to operational taxonomic units (OTUs)15 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Roche 454 sequencing yielded 1,426,326 reads of ∼450 nucleotides each, with 426 OTUs identified after quality filtering. Illumina MiSeq sequencing yielded 11,498,168 paired-end reads of 150 nucleotides each, with 1,191 OTUs identified after filtering.

To assess overall differences in microbial community structure in MS patients and controls, we calculated measures of alpha- and beta-diversity. Alpha-diversity summarizes the microbial diversity within each sample, whereas beta diversity measures differences between samples. Shannon entropy, an alpha-diversity measurement of richness and evenness, was measured at multiple sequencing depths using rarefaction curves and was similar between MS patients and healthy controls (Supplementary Fig. 2). To determine whether overall microbial community structure was different between MS patients and controls, we calculated differences in beta-diversity using the weighted and unweighted UniFrac metric. Statistical analyses of the resulting matrices using the analysis of molecular variance technique did not reveal significant differences in overall microbial community structure between the two groups (Supplementary Fig. 3).

At the phylum level, the faecal microbiota of both groups was dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with smaller contributions of Euryarchaeota, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria. The relative abundances of microbiota at the phylum level were compared between the entire MS cohort (both treated and untreated) and controls (Fig. 2). MS patients had a significantly increased relative abundance of the phyla Euryarchaeota and Verrucomicrobia compared to healthy controls (DESeq, Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P value<0.05) by Roche 454 and Illumina sequencing (Fig. 2a, Table 2).

HC, healthy controls; MS, multiple sclerosis; unc, unclassified; Untr, untreated MS patients; Tr, treated MS patients.

The table lists taxa that differ between HC and MS patients, between HC and Untr and between untreated and Tr, detected on two different sequencing platforms, 454 and MiSeq. Significant differences were tested by DESeq, and P values were adjusted by the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Relative abundances are listed. Values that are significant (P<0.05) on both platforms are in bold. Taxa are listed at the genus level or at their lowest possible level of classification, followed by unc. Genera that were not detected on a given platform are indicated with a (—). Non-significant P values are listed as n.s.

Because immunomodulatory therapy may skew microbiota composition, we separately analysed changes in the microbiota in untreated patients. Both Euryarchaeota and Verrucomicrobia were similarly elevated in untreated MS patients compared with controls, although changes in Euryarchaeota were only significant on the 454 platform, and trended in the same direction on the MiSeq platform. Consistent with other microbiota studies in humans, we detected inter-individual variability within control and MS patients. Thus, we provide rank abundance plots to depict phylum level abundances in each subject (Supplementary Fig. 4).

We next investigated whether relative abundances of the microbiota differed between MS (untreated and treated) patients and controls at the genus level (Fig. 2b,c). The relative abundances of Methanobrevibacter, a genus in the phylum Euryarchaeota, and Akkermansia, a genus in the phylum Verrucomicrobia, were both increased in MS patients compared with controls by Roche 454 sequencing and by Illumina sequencing (Fig. 2c, Table 2). Furthermore, Butyricimonas, which belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes had a reduced relative abundance in MS as detected by both sequencing platforms. These changes were similarly detected in untreated MS patients compared with controls (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 5). In addition Collinsella and Slackia, both belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria, and Prevotella, belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes was decreased in untreated MS patients as detected by both sequencing platforms (Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 6). In general, the results from the two sequencing platforms were concordant, with 98% of the total microbial abundance composed of shared genera. While we were able to detect some primer bias (for example, higher detection of Akkermansia with the MiSeq V4 strategy compared with the 454 V35 strategy) the MS-related changes generally remained the same (Supplementary Fig. 7).

We then asked whether immunomodulatory therapy was associated with an altered microbiota in treated versus untreated MS patients. We found that treated patients had increases in the Prevotella and Sutterella as detected by Roche 454 and by Illumina sequencing (Fig. 2c, Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 8). Since these genera are either significantly reduced or show a trend of reduced populations in untreated patients compared with controls, it suggests that treatment with immunomodulatory therapy may normalize some of the MS-related changes in the microbiota. The genus Sarcina was reduced in treated versus untreated MS patients by both sequencing platforms (Fig. 2b,c). However, Sarcina levels were similar between untreated patients and controls, suggesting a treatment-associated effect. No significant differences in the microbiota were noted when MS patients treated with interferon therapy were compared with those treated with glatiramer acetate, although the sample sizes of these subsets were not sufficiently powered to evaluate this comparison.

To determine whether the differences we observed were related to age, gender or body mass index (BMI), we reanalysed our data using a multi-factorial model. For all MS patients (treated and untreated) compared with controls, the differences in relative abundances for the genera Methanobrevibacter, Akkermansia and Butyricimonas remained significant with at least one of the sequencing platforms. We also found that treatment-related differences in relative abundances for the genera Prevotella, Sutterella and Sarcina remained significant.

Validating bacterial identification is important to select the optimal bacteria to monitor in translational studies, however, partial 16S rRNA reads do not always provide sufficient information for identification to the species level. Thus, phylogenetic placement of 16S rRNA sequences was used to further identify taxa of interest and to assess the accuracy of identification using pplacer16 (Supplementary Figs 9 and 10). The representative sequence from the most prevalent OTU was used for each taxa of interest. The Methanobrevibacter sequence from our study placed most closely to reference M. smithii (placement likelihood (PL)=0.94), Akkermansia placed most closely to A. muciniphila (PL=1.00), and Butyricimonas had a greater likelihood of identification as B. synergistica (PL=0.83) than B. virosa (PL=0.50). For genera found to be different between untreated MS patients and controls, Collinsella placed most closely to C. aerofaciens (PL=0.85), Slackia placed closer to S. isoflavoniconvertens (PL=1.0 than to S. piriformis (PL=0.76), Prevotella placed closer to P. stercorea (PL=1.0) than to two different P. copri reference strains (PL=0.76 and 0.81). For taxa found to be different between untreated and treated MS patients, Sutterella could not be resolved between S. stercoricanis or S. wadsworthensis (PL=1.0 and 1.0, respectively) and sequences mapped to the genus Sarcina placed closest to S. ventriculi (two sequences placing near S. ventriculi with likelihoods of 0.66 and 0.85). In total, pplacer was able to identify the most likely genus and species from currently available reference databases.

We used the Nanostring immunology panel to measure the expression of 568 immune-related genes from peripheral blood derived CD4+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes from a subset of 18 MS patients and 18 controls subjects. Because Methanobrevibacter was significantly increased in MS patients compared with healthy subjects, and since Methanobrevibacter has been previously implicated as a proinflammatory microbe17, we selected MS patients and healthy subjects from our cohort that had the highest and lowest populations of Methanobrevibacter. The demographics and disease characteristics of MS patients and healthy subjects within this subset were similar to those of the larger group (Supplementary Table 1).

Since we observed correlations between the abundance of specific microbes and gene expression in monocytes and T cells from MS patients, we were interested in determining whether these organisms might drive an altered immunologic response in MS patients and controls. Because lipids derived from Methanobrevibacter are reported to have adjuvant effects24, we investigated Methanobrevibacter smithii induced proliferation and cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but found no difference in the response to Methanobrevibacter in MS patients versus controls or in subjects with high Methanobrevibacter in the gut (Supplementary Fig. 12).

We then examined whether sera from MS patients and healthy subjects contained antibodies reactive to Methanobrevibacter or components of Methanobrevibacter. We found anti-Methanobrevibacter IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies (titre >1:64) as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against lysates of Methanobrevibacter in 33% of MS patients and 28% of controls, with no differences in anti-Methanobrevibacter antibody titres between the two groups.

Because Methanobrevibacter is the dominant methane-producing microbe that inhabits the human gastrointestinal tract, the likely presence of Methanobrevibacter in the gut can be measured indirectly by a breath test, which assesses exhaled methane by gas chromatography25. Detection of >1 parts-per-million of methane in the breath reflects the presence of at least 107–108 methanogens per gram of stool and has been shown to be driven by Methanobrevibacter smithii26. After we discovered increased Methanobrevibacter in the gut by 16S rRNA sequencing, we performed a methane breath test on a second cohort of 41 MS patients and 32 controls to determine whether we could verify the presence of methane-producing organisms by a simple and independent in vivo measurement. The second cohort was chosen to resemble our first cohort (Supplementary Table 2). We detected the presence of methane in 13/41 MS patients versus. 8/32 controls. MS patients had elevated levels of breath methane versus controls (8.07±2.46 versus 1.65±0.93 ppm, (t-test, P value<1.81 × 10−2), consistent with our observation of increased methanogens in the gut of MS patients (Fig. 4).

Host-commensal interactions have increasingly been shown to play a role in the induction of autoimmunity both in experimental animals and human diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis8,27,28. The origin of the autoimmune process in multiple sclerosis is still poorly understood and whether the inciting factors that trigger inflammation primarily occur in the central nervous system or in the periphery is unknown. Given that disease concordance in MS is 25% in monozygotic twins, both genetic and environmental factors likely contribute to the development of disease29, and the gut microbiota might be one such environmental factor.

In summary, we have found alterations of the human gut microbiome in MS that correlate with changes in the immune transcriptome and treatment. It is possible that treatment strategies of MS in the future may include therapeutic interventions designed to affect the microbiome such as probiotics, faecal transplantation and delivery of constituents of organisms isolated from the microbiome10, although more work is required. In addition, characterization of the gut microbiome in MS may provide biomarkers for assessing disease activity and could theoretically be an avenue to prevent MS in young at-risk populations.

Relapsing–remitting MS patients were recruited from the Partners MS Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital and healthy subjects from the Brigham and Women's Hospital PhenoGenetic project (http://dejager_lab.bwh.harvard.edu/?page_id=2317). Untreated patients were treatment naive or with no steroid treatment in the previous month, no beta-interferon/glatiramer acetate treatment in the previous 3 months, and no other treatments over the prior 6 months. None of the MS patients had an active relapse at the time of sampling. Patients with a history of using other immunosuppressive medications including teriflunomide, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulin, daclizumab, basiliximab, azathioprine, methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil were excluded. Treated patients in the cohort were those who had received beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate for at least 6 months. Exclusion criteria for both MS subjects and healthy control subjects were as follows: no antibiotic use in the prior 6 months; no probiotic use; corticosteroids; history of gastroenteritis; or travel outside of the country in the prior month. No history of irritable bowel syndrome, bowel surgery, inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune disease. Pregnancy was also an exclusion criteria. A dietary survey was administered to all subjects before collection of samples (Supplementary Table 3). The protocol was approved by the Partners Human Research Committee and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.

Stool samples were obtained from patients by providing them with stool collection containers. We used a consistent methodology for processing and storage of all samples. Subjects collected a single-sample produced at any time of day with no specific dietary restrictions. Collection containers were then placed in boxes with provided ice packs for immediate shipment to our laboratory via overnight delivery at a maintained temperature of 0 °C. On receipt of samples, they were frozen at −80 °C until DNA extraction55. Samples were only subjected to a single free-thaw cycle.

For Roche 454 pyrosequencing, DNA was extracted using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with the Human Microbiome Project modifications to the manufacturer's protocol56. DNA quality and yield were evaluated via agarose gel and Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The 16S rRNA gene libraries were generated by the Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research at Baylor College of Medicine, using the V3–V5 (357F/926R) primer in accordance with standard Human Microbiome Project protocols55. The 16S rRNA libraries were sequenced by the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine using a Roche 454 GS FLX+ instrument (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) operated with Titanium chemistry.

For Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA sequencing, methods were adapted from the protocol developed for the NIH-Human Microbiome Project55. Briefly, bacterial genomic DNA was extracted using the MO BIO PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories). The 16S rRNA V4 region was amplified by PCR and sequenced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) using the 2 × 150 bp paired-end protocol. The primers used for amplification contain adaptors for MiSeq sequencing and dual-index barcodes so that the PCR products may be pooled and sequenced directly57. Sequencing was performed at the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine.

Sequencing of the 105 human stool samples on the Roche 454 GS FLX+ instrument generated 1,426,326 total raw reads. Raw reads were processed using the mothur software package (v.1.34.2)14 (ref. 15), which performs demultiplexing and denoising, quality filtering, alignment against the ARB Silva reference database of 16S rRNA gene sequences, and clustering into OTUs (at 97% identity; Supplementary Fig. 1). In total, 4317 OTUs were generated. After filtering OTUs that failed to have a mean number of reads per sample ≥1 in at least one cohort, 426 OTUs were available for further analysis.

Sequencing of the samples on the Illumina MiSeq instrument generated 11,498,168 total forward raw reads. Preprocessing was performed using the mothur software package. The mothur MiSeq SOP was followed, except we used a custom Python script to perform base quality trimming (sliding window size of 50 nt with average quality score >35); this modification was employed to improve the quality of sequencing reads used for OTU clustering, since the standard mothur SOP assumes longer sequencing reads than generated by our MiSeq protocol. 10,620 OTUs were generated, with 1,191 OTUs available for further analysis after filtering using the same procedure as described for the Roche 454 data (Supplementary Fig 1).

A measure of alpha diversity, the Shannon entropy58 was calculated for the samples, and the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test59 was applied for hypothesis testing. To visualize differences in overall microbial community structure, the unweighted and weighted UniFrac measures were calculated between all pairs of samples, and Principal Coordinates Analysis plots were generated using custom R scripts60. Analysis of molecular variance was used for statistical hypothesis testing of differences in overall microbial community structure between cohorts as assessed with the UniFrac measures61.

To more accurately identify the microorganisms present in samples and their phylogenetic relationships to known species, the pplacer software package was used to perform phylogenetic placement16. Pplacer uses a likelihood-based methodology to place short sequencing reads of 16S rRNA amplicons on a reference tree, and also generates taxonomic classifications of the short sequencing reads using a least common ancestor-based algorithm. The reference tree required for phylogenetic placement was generated using full-length or near full-length (>1,200 nt) 16S rRNA sequences of type strains from the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP)65. 9,563 16S rRNA sequences were downloaded from RDP-11-1, representing 8,719 type strains with 375 sequences from Archaea and 9,188 sequences from Bacteria strains. Filtering was performed using custom Python scripts with the following criteria: (1) only one sequence per species (if the species had more than one sequence, then the longest sequence was chosen); (2) non-environmental species (using key words); (3) no sequences with unclear taxonomic lineage information; (4) no redundant sequences. 7,890 16S rRNA sequences were retained for constructing the phylogenetic tree. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using Muscle66. Per the pplacer manual (http://matsen.github.io/pplacer/generated_rst/pplacer.html), the 16S rRNA reference tree was constructed using FastTree with parameter ‘-nt –gtr' (ref. 67). FastTree infers phylogenetic trees using an approximate maximum likelihood-based approach, and generates local support values to estimate the reliability of each split in the tree by using the Shimodaira–Hasegawa test on the three alternate topologies (NNIs) around that split, counting the fraction of 1,000 resamples that support a split over the two potential NNIs around that node. Local support values of >0.95 are considered to strongly support splits, and those >0.70 are considered to moderately support splits. To generate the phylogenetic placement figures in the main manuscript (Supplementary Figs 9 and 10), representative sequences for each species within the genus of interest were chosen (the most abundant unique sequence assigned to that species by pplacer).

A separate cohort of subjects was utilized for methane breath testing. The inclusion and exclusion criteria used to recruit patients was identical to that described above. Breath samples were collected from subjects after an overnight fast. All subjects brushed their teeth following the 8-hour fast then produced end-expiratory breath samples into provided collection tubes. Collection tubes were sent to Commonwealth Labs (Salem, MA) where gas chromatography was performed to assess the presence of exhaled methane as described previously26.

The Methanobrevibacter smithii type strain (ATCC 35061) was cultured at the University of Massachusetts using methods previously described68. Assesment of antibodies against M. Smithii was performed by ELISA. Lysates of Methanobrevibacter were prepared from sonicates of Methanobrevibacter cultures. PBMCs were isolated as previously described69. PBMCs were stimulated with Methanobrevibacter smithii, tetanus toxoid or anti-CD3/CD28 in 15 healthy donors and 14 MS patients. Methanobrevibacter smithii was cultured in a ratio of 1 bacteria to 1, 10, 100 or 1,000 PBMCs. Thymidine incorporation was measured 4 days following stimulation. Cytokine production was measured by Luminex assay (Miltenyi Biotec). Monocytes and T cells were sorted from PBMCs from 20 MS patients and 20 healthy controls (see below) using a Miltenyi Biotec (Alburn, CA) selection kit. Total RNA was extracted using Norgen RNA purification kits (Norgen Biotek Corp., norgenbiotek.com). NanoString expression of immune genes was detected by NanoString array (nCounter, Gene expression code set, Human Immunology kit) as previously described69.

T cells and monocytes were sorted from PBMCs from 20 MS patients and 20 healthy subjects. These participants were chosen from the larger cohort by selecting 10 MS patients with the highest Methanobrevibacter relative abundance, 10 MS patients with the lowest Methanobrevibacter relative abundance, 10 healthy subjects with the highest Methanobrevibacter relative abundance and 10 healthy subjects with the lowest Methanobrevibacter relative abundance. Of these samples, T cells and monocytes from two MS patients and two healthy subjects either had low viability of low recovery of RNA thus these samples were excluded from further analysis. Count data were normalized using the nSolver Analysis software (Nanostring), significant differences were detected by t-test and P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg correction to assess significance at the 0.05 level.

Pathway annotations were conducted using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen) and canonical pathways that had an activation score >1.5 or <−1.5 in either T cells or monocytes were reported. Spearman's correlations between microbial abundance and immune gene expression was calculated in the R statistical framework70 using the cor.test in the stats package and plotted using the ellipse package71.
