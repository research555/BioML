Prospective associations of the infant gut microbiome and microbial function with social behaviors related to autism at age 3 years

The hypothesized link between gut bacteria and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been explored through animal models and human studies with microbiome assessment after ASD presentation. We aimed to prospectively characterize the association between the infant/toddler gut microbiome and ASD-related social behaviors at age 3 years. As part of an ongoing birth cohort gut bacterial diversity, structure, taxa, and function at 6 weeks (n = 166), 1 year (n = 158), 2 years (n = 129), and 3 years (n = 140) were quantified with 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing (n = 101 six weeks, n = 103 one year). ASD-related social behavior was assessed at age 3 years using Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) T-scores. Covariate-adjusted linear and permutation-based models were implemented. Microbiome structure at 1 year was associated with SRS-2 total T-scores (p = 0.01). Several taxa at 1, 2, and 3 years were associated with SRS-2 performance, including many in the Lachnospiraceae family. Higher relative abundance of Adlercreutzia equolifaciens and Ruminococcus torques at 1 year related to poorer SRS-2 performance. Two functional pathways, l-ornithine and vitamin B6 biosynthesis, were associated with better social skills at 3 years. Our results support potential associations between early-childhood gut microbiome and social behaviors. Future mechanistic studies are warranted to pinpoint sensitive targets for intervention.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a combination of disordered social behaviors and repetitive or restricted interests, affects one in 34 boys and one in 145 girls in the United States, with altered behaviors presenting in some children as early as 18 months of age or younger1, but most children are not diagnosed until after age three2–8. Early symptoms of ASD include poor eye contact, problems with social behaviors (difficulty with joint attention, no response to their name, poor nonverbal communication), and poor imitation skills; many children are not evaluated until families identify a delay in verbal communication9. Diagnosing ASD as early as infancy and resultant early intervention has been shown to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes, highlighting the importance of identifying potential biomarkers for early detection10–12. Even among neurotypical children a spectrum of behaviors exists13, some of which may create challenges in personal relationships and learning and professional environments. While several risk factors for ASD have been identified or hypothesized including genetics14, maternal infection during pregnancy15–17, and environmental exposures18, the etiologies are not well understood, leading to treatments targeting symptoms rather than underlying causes19. As a result, therapies, apart from early-life behavioral interventions, are often minimally effective20,21.

Our study aimed to address these gaps by examining the infant/toddler microbiome at four early-life time points, beginning at 6 weeks postpartum, in relation to a continuous measure of social behavior at 3 years of age. In addition to investigating bacterial diversity, structure, and specific taxa, we inferred gene function from metagenomic sequences to identify pathways associated with essential features of ASD.

Study populations were similar across the four time points; most mothers reported not smoking during pregnancy (> 95%) and approximately half were parous (Table
1). Most parents were not of advanced age (average maternal age at delivery 32.3 ± 4.6 years, average paternal age at delivery 33.6 ± 5.8 years). SRS-2 total T-scores were lower (better) and had a narrower distribution than the normative population (a nationally representative sample of 474 ratings of 247 children34) to which the test is standardized (i.e., approximate mean ± SD: 44 ± 5 in each study population compared to 50 ± 10 in the normative sample). As expected, within subject diversity increased as the microbiome sample age increased [mean ± SD Shannon Indices: 1.66 ± 0.49, 2.89 ± 0.56, 3.57 ± 0.46, and 3.83 ± 0.48 at 6 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively; Table
1].

At most time points, increased within-subject diversity was correlated with improved SRS-2 total T-scores [βSix-week Shannon = − 0.19 (− 0.92, 0.54), p = 0.62; βOne-year Shannon = 0.07 (− 0.60, 0.74), p = 0.83; βTwo-year Shannon = − 0.04 (− 0.79, 0.72), p = 0.93; βThree-year Shannon =  − 0.49 (− 1.25, 0.27), p = 0.21 in basic models], although the relationships were not statistically significant (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S1). Estimates were similar between basic and full models, but within-subject diversity at 6 weeks appeared to be more strongly correlated with SRS-2 total T-scores in the full model. Sensitivity analyses did not alter the conclusions (Supplementary Tables S2–S7). Using metagenomics data, all metrics of within-subject diversity at 1 year related to improved social behaviors. However, at 6 weeks higher Shannon and Simpson Indices were associated with better social behaviors, but higher taxa count related with worse social behavior (Supplementary Table S8). None of the estimates for metagenomic within-subject diversity reached statistical significance.

Community structure of the gut microbiome at 1 year was associated with total SRS-2T-scores at 3 years, particularly in the basic model (p = 0.01, 0.06 in basic and full models, respectively; Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S9). The p values were similar between the basic and full models, except for 2-year community structure, where birth mode and peripartum antibiotic exposure explained significant portions of the variability in the full model (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Table S10).

The relative abundance of specific taxa at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were associated with social behaviors (Table
2). Higher relative abundance of two ASVs in the Lachnospiraceae (Blautia producta and an unknown taxon) at 1 year were associated with worse social behavior at 3 years [e.g., βB.producta-full = 0.29 (0.15, 0.42), q = 0.017]. Similarly, higher relative abundances of Coprococcus and Bifidobacterium at 2 years were associated with poorer social behaviors in both basic and full models. Two additional taxa (Ruminococcus gnavus and Sutterella) were associated with SRS-2 total T-scores in only the basic and full models, respectively [e.g., βR.gnavus-basic = 0.17 (0.08, 0.26), q = 0.069]. At 3 years, higher relative abundance of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum was associated with worse social behavior in both basic and full models. In general, associations were modest, and the relative abundances of associated taxa were low (Table
2). Most of the statistically significantly associated taxa were in the Lachnospiraceae family (e.g., Blautia producta, Coprococcus), or more broadly in the Clostridiales order in the Firmicutes phylum (e.g., Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum), which was also true of the taxa with a nominal p value < 0.05 (Supplementary Table S11). Sensitivity and supplemental analysis results were similar (Supplementary Tables S12,S13).

Metagenomic data provided deeper insight into the taxa whose relative abundance at 6 weeks and 1 year were associated with SRS-2 total T-scores (Table
2). At 6 weeks, a taxon identified as Flavonifactor plautii was associated with worse total T-scores on the SRS-2. Similarly, at 1 year greater relative abundance of four taxa were associated with poorer social behavior, namely Adlercreutzia equolfaciens, Ruminococcus torques, Eubacterium dolichum, and a bacterium in the Lachnospiraceae, [e.g., βA.equolifaciens-full = 0.002 (0.001, 0.002), q = 0.001]. Associations between taxa and SRS-2 total T-scores reaching a nominal p value of 0.05 were largely in the Actinobacteria (class) and Clostridiales (Supplementary Table S14).

Increased relative abundance of two functional pathways, l-ornithine de novo biosynthesis and the superpathway of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate biosynthesis and salvage, at both 6 weeks and 1 year were associated with better social behavior at 3 years [e.g., βl-ornithine-6W-basic = − 2.4E−5 (− 4.2E−5, − 6.8E−6), p = 0.008; Fig. 3, Supplementary Figure S1, Supplementary Table S15]. An additional three pathways (the superpathway of l-aspartate and l-asparagine synthesis, O-antigen building blocks biosynthesis—Escherichia coli, and pentose phosphate pathway) had highly significant associations (p < 0.001) at 1 year in either basic or full models (Fig. 3, Supplementary Figure S1). Several associated pathways (p < 0.05) are involved in the urea cycle (involving aspartate, asparagine, or ornithine), pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (highly bioavailable vitamin B6) synthesis, or menaquinol biosynthesis (Supplementary Table S15).

Our analysis uncovered the potential for several novel, time-dependent associations between the early-life gut microbiome and child social behaviors at age three. Specifically, we found suggestive evidence of better social behaviors with increased within-subject microbial diversity during infancy and early childhood as well as an association with bacterial community structure at 1 year of life. Many of the taxa associated with relative decrements in social behaviors were in the Lachnospiraceae family. Metagenomic sequencing data from 6-week and 1-year fecal samples complemented our 16S rRNA findings and demonstrated several associations, including with Adlercreutzia equolifaciens and Ruminococcus torques. By classifying our metagenomic sequences into functional pathways, we also identified several promising pathways through which the microbiome may act on autism-related social behaviors.

In summary, our findings suggest an association of the infant/toddler gut microbiome with social behaviors in a US population sample. Further research is warranted to elucidate mechanisms, and to determine whether features of the gut microbiome can be used to identify ASD during a vulnerable window during which time interventions can optimize neurodevelopmental outcomes.

The New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study, an ongoing prospective pregnancy cohort, recruited pregnant women (ages 18–45) as previously described (Supplementary Methods)66. This analysis is based on a subset of children who provided a stool sample at 6 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years and completed a social behavioral assessment at 3 years (n = 273, Supplementary Figure S2, Supplementary Table S16). Although subjects overlapped in each of the populations, few (n = 21) had microbiome sequencing data at all four time points. Parents of participants provided written informed consent. Study protocols were reviewed and approved by the Center for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth, and all methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.

Stools were collected from infants/toddlers at 6 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years postpartum. If the child was using diapers, the sample was collected by parents from a study-provided diaper, as previously described67. If the child was no longer using diapers, parents were provided an acid-washed receptacle that fit into the toilet to collect a urine-free stool sample (Supplementary Methods). Established protocols were followed for 16S rRNA gene sequencing and data processing (Supplementary Methods)67–72. A subset of DNA samples (from 6-week and 1-year stools) also underwent metagenomic sequencing at Marine Biological Laboratory as previously described (Supplementary Methods)73–75.

Approximately 3 years postpartum, parents were asked to complete the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd edition, preschool form (SRS-2), which asks about their child’s usual behavior34,76. The SRS-2 is a standardized, validated instrument designed to assess social behavioral deficits and autistic traits as reflected in five components of social behavior (awareness, cognition, communication, motivation, and restricted interests/repetitive behavior) on a continuous scale77. SRS-2 provides raw and age-standardized T-scores for each subscale as well as an overall total score. The T-scores are standardized to a mean (SD) of 50 (10) with higher scores indicating poorer social behavioral skills. For some visual representations of results scores were dichotomized at 50 points (approximately 1 SD above our population mean, 5–10% of each study population above), but continuous total T-scores were used for all primary analyses. In clinical settings a more stringent cut off of 60 points is applied to identify individuals with mild social impairment.

Preliminary analyses identified factors associated with SRS-2 total T-scores in the study population and covariates were then selected if they were associated with SRS-2 scores (and in some cases the microbiome), but unlikely to be a factor for which the microbiome acts as a mediator. These included child age at follow-up, maternal education, maternal marital status, parity, maternal and paternal age at delivery, and child sex—the basic model. Additional models were run including autism risk factors for which the microbiome may act as a partial mediator (basic model variables and maternal smoking during pregnancy78, early postnatal exclusive breastfeeding79–81, delivery mode82, perinatal antibiotic exposure83, and continuous gestational age at delivery84—the full model).

Shannon and Simpson Indices and taxa count were linearly regressed against SRS-2 total T-scores adjusting for covariates included in the basic and full models. The Shannon Index is reported as the primary within-subject diversity metric because it accounts for both richness and evenness of species85. Bacterial community structure was contrasted between subjects with generalized UniFrac (GUniFrac) distances86. To assess the significance of the relation between bacterial community structure and SRS-2 total T-scores we employed the adonis2 function in the “vegan” package with 10,000 permutations87. Multivariate Association with Linear Models (MaAsLin2) was used to determine the association between individual amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and total SRS-2T-scores88,89. We restricted our analyses to ASVs with at least 0.001% relative abundance in at least 10% of subjects to reduce multiple testing. Any taxon-level association with an FDR-corrected q-value < 0.25 was considered statistically significant, which is the MaAsLin default and is commonly used in microbiome studies where further investigation and validation of results is necessary90,91. A complementary analysis using diversities and taxon relative abundances derived from metagenomic data was conducted at 6 weeks and 1 year. Pathway relative abundances associated with SRS-2 total T-scores were determined with MaAsLin2, restricting to pathways with at least 0.0001% in at least 10% of samples. Due to the exploratory nature of this analysis, all pathways with a nominal p value < 0.05 were deemed of interest. Sensitivity analyses are described in Supplementary Methods.
