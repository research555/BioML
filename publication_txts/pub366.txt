Antidepressants fluoxetine and amitriptyline induce alterations in intestinal microbiota and gut microbiome function in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress

Antidepressant medications are known to modulate the central nervous system, and gut microbiota can play a role in depression via microbiota–gut–brain axis. But the impact of antidepressants on gut microbiota function and composition remains poorly understood. Thus this study assessed the effect of serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant fluoxetine (Flu) and tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline (Ami) administration on gut microbiota composition, diversity, and species abundance, along with microbial function in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression rat model. Oral administration of Ami and Flu significantly altered the overall gut microbiota profile of CUMS-induced rats, as assessed using the permutational multivariate analysis of variance test. At the phylum level, 6-week of antidepressant treatment led to a decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio due to an enhanced Bacteroidetes and reduced Firmicutes relative abundance. Flu was more potent than Ami at altering the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes levels in the CUMS rats. At the family level, both antidepressants significantly increased the abundance of Porphyromonadaceae. However, an increased Bacteroidaceae level was significantly associated with Ami, not Flu treatment. Furthermore, at the genus level, an increase in the relative abundance of Parabacteroides, Butyricimonas, and Alistipes was observed following Ami and Flu treatment. Subsequent metagenomics and bioinformatics analysis further indicated that Ami and Flu likely also modulated metabolic pathways, such as those involved in carbohydrate metabolism, membrane transport, and signal transduction. Additionally, both antidepressants affected antibiotic resistome, such as for aminoglycoside (aph3iiiA), multidrug (mdtK, mdtP, mdtH, mdtG, acrA), and tetracycline (tetM) resistance in CUMS rats. These data clearly illustrated the direct impact of oral administration of Flu and Ami on the gut microbiome, thus set up the foundation to reveal more insights on the therapeutic function of the antidepressants and their overall contribution to host health.

Depression, a widespread and debilitating mental disorder, is characterised by low sensitivity, mood, sleeplessness, and loss of interest in enjoyable activities1,2. The complex aetiology involves dysregulated neuroendocrine3, neuroimmune4, metabolic5, and neurotransmitter systems6. According to the World Health Organisation, depression affects ~350 million people worldwide7 and has become one of the most attention-worthy disorders owing to the high rates of morbidity and mortality8–10. A number of therapies have been applied clinically for the treatment of depression, including drug therapy, psychotherapy, physical therapy, exercise therapy, and acupuncture11. In particular, antidepressants represent a major and widely used means of treating depression and are globally available12.

Therefore, the objective of the study was to investigate the impact of antidepressant treatment on the gut microbiome of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rats, an animal model of depression. In addition to the commonly used 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we also used shotgun metagenomics analyses for the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), to compare the functional profiles. The data not only contribute to the knowledge of gut impacting drugs but also have direct clinical implications.

The animal protocol for the study was approved by Institutional Animal Care and the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of South China Agricultural University (Permit Number 2017-B017). Pathogen-free adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (180–220 g) were obtained from Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center (Guangzhou, China). Overall, the animal study lasted for 15 weeks. All rats were acclimatised for 1 week to the laboratory environment (12 h light/dark cycle, 25 ± 1 °C, and 55–65% relative humidity), with ad libitum access to food and water; each rat was housed per cage. The experimental timeline is presented in Supplementary Fig. 1. Following acclimatisation, 48 rats were randomly divided into two groups: healthy control (HC; n = 12) and CUMS (n = 36), with all rats being housed independently. With the exception of HC rats, all were subjected to eight different chronic unpredictable mild stimuli for 14 weeks, including 8 weeks of depression model development and a 6-week treatment period. The CUMS-resistant rats were screened using behaviour tests (sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT) and light/dark test (LDT)) after 8 weeks of exposure to CUMS. To ensure adequate statistical power, the remaining rats were randomly divided into three groups according to body weight as follows: model (CUMS, n = 6), Ami treatment (Ami, n = 6), and Flu treatment (Flu, n = 7) groups. The Flu used in this study was purchased from LILLY (Eli Lilly and Company, IN, USA). Amitriptyline was purchased from Dongting (Hunan Dongting Pharmaceutical, Hunan, China). The antidepressant groups were administered with Ami (25 mg/kg/d) or Flu (12 mg/kg/d) for 6 weeks by oral gavage, whereas the HC and CUMS rats were administered with equal volumes of sterile water. SPT was performed during weeks 0, 9, and 15. Behaviour tests (OFT, LDT) were performed pre- and post-Ami and Flu treatment. Faecal samples were collected at weeks 9 and 15. At week 9, using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, faecal samples from randomly chosen CUMS-induced (n = 12) and HC (n = 12) rats were collected and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. In addition, faecal samples of 3 individual rats randomly chosen from each group (HC: n = 3; CUMS: n = 3; Ami: n = 3; Flu: n = 3) were subjected to metagenome analysis at week 15. At the end of the experiment, the rats were fasted for 12 h, anaesthetised using 6% (v/v) chloral hydrate, and euthanised. In these studies, no blinding was done.

The CUMS procedures were performed as previously described39,40. The protocol comprised eight stressors: food deprivation for 24 h, water deprivation for 24 h, flash stimulation (150 flashes/min for 5 min), cage tilting at 45° for 24 h, overnight illumination for 8 h, wet cage environment (200 mL water added to sawdust bedding) for 24 h, tail suspension for 5 min, 60 °C heat stimulation for 6 min, and nipped tail for 5 min. Stressors were applied at least 13 times and without repetitive stressors in two consecutive days. To prevent being influenced by the CUMS rats, the HC rats were housed in an adjacent room and had no contact with the model animals. The model rats were authenticated by behaviour tests upon completion of the model development period.

The body weights of all rats were recorded each week. Anxiety-like and depression-like behaviours were examined using SPT, OFT, and LDT. In SPT, rats were trained to adapt to a sucrose solution (1%, w/v): two bottles of sucrose solution were placed in each cage for 24 h, subsequently, each bottle of sucrose solution was replaced with water for 24 h. After adaptation, the mice were deprived of water and food for 24 h. The rats were then given ad libitum access to water and sucrose solution for 4 h, after which the remaining volume of water and sucrose solution were measured. Sucrose preference was calculated using the formula as follows: sucrose preference = sucrose consumption/ (water and sucrose consumption) × 100%41. In OFT, an open field consisting of a black square (80 × 80 × 60 cm) was divided into 16 equal squares. Each rat was placed in the centre of an open arena and rat behaviour was recorded for 5 min. Prior to the start of the test, 30 s was set for adaptation. The total number of crossings and rearings was recorded42. In LDT, each rat was placed in the centre of an apparatus (40 × 30 × 35 cm) containing two chambers of equal size, one bright and the other dark. Total time spent in the dark zone was recorded for 5 min43.

To profile the microbial composition, faecal samples were subjected to total genome DNA extraction using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit following the manufacturer’s instruction (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). The V4–V5 region of 16S rRNA genes of the samples was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (98 °C for 60 s, followed by 30 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 5 min), using primers 515 F 5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′ and 907 R 5′-CCGTCAATTCCTTTGAGTTT-3′. The sequencing libraries of the V4–V5 region of the 16 S rRNA genes were generated using the TruSeq® DNA PCR-Free Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instruction, and index codes were added. The libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. QIIME software (Version 1.7.0)44 was used to analyse alpha- (within samples) and beta- (among samples) diversity. Reads were first filtered by QIIME quality filters and chimera sequences were removed using the UCHIME algorithm. The filtered sequences were then clustered into OTUs according to representative sequence using UPARSE software45 (Version 7.0.1001) and classified against the Greengenes database46 with a threshold of 97% sequence similarity. Alpha-diversity was applied toward analysing the complexity of species diversity for a sample through four indices including observed-species, Chao 1, Simpson, and Shannon. Principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on weighted and unweighted UniFrac metrics was used to assess the variation of bacterial composition among different groups and phases. These analyses were performed using the free online Majorbio I-Sanger Cloud Platform (https://cloud.majorbio.com/). The 16S rRNA sequence data for representative samples were deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra)47.

To explore the microbial metabolic function and ARGs of the rat faecal microbiota, DNA extracts of the representative samples were further subjected to shotgun metagenomics sequencing analysis on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform using the HiSeq 4000 PE Cluster Kit and HiSeq 4000 SBS Kits. Open reading frames (ORFs) predicted from all samples were merged and aligned to each other. Gene pairs with >95% identity (no gap allowed) and aligned reads covering over 90% of the shorter reads were grouped together. The longest ORF in each group was used to represent the group; while, the other ORFs of the group were regarded as redundant sequences. ORFs with a length less than 100 bp were subsequently filtered out. Based on this reference gene set, taxonomic assignment and functional annotation were further conducted using the latest version (Version 2.2.28+) of the KEGG database48 and Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database49. The metagenomics datasets were deposited into the SRA database.

To investigate co-occurrence patterns of microbial community and ARGs, correlation matrices were constructed by calculating each pairwise Spearman’s rank correlation. A correlation between any two items was considered statistically robust if the Spearman’s correlation coefficient (ρ) was >0.8 and the P-value was <0.0150. The resulting correlation matrices were translated into an association network using Cytoscape v3. 7. 151.

In this study, 2,127,824 high quality-filtered and chimera-checked sequences were generated, with an average length of 372.38 bp across all samples. The mean number of reads per sample was 68,639, ranging from 58,524 to 74,062 reads. A total of 702 OTUs (97% sequence similarity) were detected among all samples. Based on relative abundance, the taxonomic analysis revealed 16 bacteria phyla, 30 classes, 49 orders, 88 families, and 194 genera across all samples. OTUs that reached 97% similarity were used for alpha-diversity estimations, which included observed OTUs (Sobs), diversity (Shannon and Simpson indices), richness (Chao I), coverage (Good’s coverage), and rarefaction curve analysis using Mothur52 (Version 1.30.23). Results on behaviour assessments (body weight, sucrose preference ratio, numbers of crossings and rearings, time spent in the dark zone) were compared among groups using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the least significant difference test using Statistical Package for Social Science programme (SPSS 22.0, Armonk, NY, USA). PCoA based on weighted and unweighted UniFrac metrics was used to assess the variation of bacterial composition among different groups and different phases. The relative abundance of faecal microbiota, ARGs, and KOs in the four groups was compared using the Kruskal–Wallis H test with Tukey’s posthoc tests was used in the case of pairwise comparison. Moreover, LEfSe analysis combining the Kruskal–Wallis test with linear discriminant analysis was used to identify the differential KEGG pathway representation between faecal microbiomes of the two groups. A threshold value >2 was used as the cut off value for statistical significance based on a P-value of 0.05.

As illustrated in Fig.
1a, no statistically significant differences were observed in the sucrose preference ratio among the rats during the adaptation period. After 8 weeks of model development, one-way ANOVA revealed that the results of the SPT and anxiety-like behaviour tests (e.g., sucrose preference ratio, open field rearing and crossing numbers, and total time spent in the dark zone) of the CUMS-induced rats significantly differed from those in the HC group (Fig. 1b–d). It is worth noting that using hierarchical cluster analysis, after 8-week exposure to CUMS, a small subpopulation of the rats did not express depression-like symptoms. Sequencing data showed that faecal microbiota composition of the rats without (CUMS-resistant) and with depression-like symptoms were clearly separated into two subgroups (Supplementary Fig. 2), indicating a strong association between gut microbiota composition and depression-like behaviours. The CUMS-resistant mice were then removed from the rest of the studies. Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig.
1h, the CUMS-induced rats weighed less than the HC rats. These data suggested that the CUMS-induced depressive model was successfully established. Notably, PCoA plots of the 16S rRNA gene sequence data based on weighted and unweighted UniFrac metrics showed that the bacterial microbiota of HC was clustered and separated from those of established CUMS rats at week 9 (P < 0.05, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA); Fig. 1j, k and Supplementary Table 1). After 6 weeks of treatment with Ami or Flu, one-way ANOVA results suggested a reversal of the depression and anxiety behaviours of the CUMS-induced rats, including the recovery of sucrose preference ratio, improved activity rates, and significantly decreased time spent in the dark zone (Fig. 1e–g). However, there was no significant change in the weight of the rats treated with antidepressants (Fig.
1i).

All sample coverage (Good’s coverage) exceeded 99.50%, indicating that sequencing accuracy was reliable. Multiple rarefaction curves were measured using several metrics; i.e., Sobs, Chao 1, Simpson, and Shannon, which confirmed adequate sequence coverage for all samples (Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). To assess overall differences in microbial community structure among HC, CUMS, Ami and Flu groups, we calculated measures of alpha- and beta-diversity, for ecological diversity within a given sample, and between samples, respectively. Shannon Index, an alpha-diversity measure of both microbial richness and evenness, was enhanced following Ami treatment (P < 0.05; Fig.
2a). ‘Observed’ diversity, a measurement of OTU number, was increased after Flu treatment (P < 0.05; Fig.
2b). Although the alpha-diversity of CUMS rats was lower than that of HC rats, there was no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05).

To determine whether overall microbial community structure differed among the four groups, we calculated the differences in beta-diversity using the weighted and unweighted UniFrac metric and visualised communities by PCoA (Fig. 2c, d). The PCoA results showed that the microbial communities in the CUMS group exhibited a distinct composition compared to that of HC rats, despite their access to similar food and water. However, the gut microbiota profiles of the antidepressant-treated rats demonstrated separation from those of CUMS rats, as assessed by the PERMANOVA test for clustering of weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances (P < 0.05; Supplementary Table 2). Notably, PCoA plots based on the metric indicated that the difference between the microbial communities of rats in the HC and CUMS groups at week 9 is greater than that at week 15 (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). The natural maturation of gut microbiota during growth even in the control group HC (Fig. 3a, b) and potentially reduced susceptibility to the same types of stress after extended exposure in CUMS rats might contribute to the phenomenon. Also, the microbial community of the CUMS group at week 9 was far away from other groups, leading to the change of the relative distance among the remaining groups in the presentation. Thus, although using the same data, it appeared that CUMS and HC groups at week 15 were separated in the PCoA plots in Fig. 2c, d, but differed in Supplementary Fig. S4a, b. Regardless, even though CUMS and HC groups at week 15 were relatively close in the PCoA plots, the phylum, family, genus levels and functions of faecal microbiota were still distinct, as illustrated by the DNA sequence data as presented in Figs.
3–6.

At the phylum level, 16S rRNA gene sequencing data illustrated that the alterations of principal faecal microbiota between HC and CUMS rats were similar at weeks 9 and 15 (Fig.
3a). Moreover, from the week 15 results we observed that Ami and Flu treatments were the key categorical variable for faecal microbiota alterations. To further assess the structural response of faecal microbiota to antidepressant treatment, bacterial communities of all four groups at week 15 were compared. There were 16 different phyla identified across all faecal samples, of which only four had more than 1% overall relative abundance, namely, Firmicutes (65.96%), Bacteroidetes (30.10%), Actinobacteria (1.73%), Tenericutes (1.49%). ‘Others’ represents microbiota that constituted <1% of the abundance in all samples. Phylum level analysis showed a clear alteration of gut community associated with Ami and Flu characterised by a lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio compared to CUMS rats, due to a reduced Firmicutes and increased Bacteroidetes. Moreover, the relative abundance in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes reached a significant level between Flu and CUMS groups (P < 0.05; Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Table 3).

To further validate the potential impact elicited by antidepressants on the microbial composition mentioned above, we also used the shotgun sequencing data for microbiota profile assessment. The abundances of five species were significantly higher and 21 species were significantly lower in the CUMS rats than those in the HC rats (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Notably, we observed four Bacteroides species were enriched in the HC group compared to the CUMS group, which was consistent with the 16S sequencing analysis results. Similar results were observed in the antidepressants treatment group compared with the CUMS group. Specifically, eight Bacteroides, Parabacteroides and Butyricimonas species were significantly increased in the Ami group, while three Alistipes species were enriched in the Flu group (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c). Hence, although Ami and Flu are both antidepressants, they exhibited different impacts on the faecal microbial composition. Specifically, compared with Flu, Ami treatment significantly enhanced the abundance of several Bacteroides and Butyricimonas species (Supplementary Fig. 6d). Although Flu also increased the abundance of both genera in CUMS rats according to metagenomic sequencing data, the effect of Ami may be more potent, particularly regarding the altered abundance of Bacteroides.

Analysis of the ARG profiles of faecal samples in the HC, CUMS, Ami, and Flu groups revealed that the total abundance of ARGs was similar among the four groups, with no significant differences observed (Fig.
5a). As several different ARGs might encode resistance to the same type of antibiotic, the relative abundance of ARGs was aggregated to the corresponding antibiotic type for each sample. Results showed that for the four groups, ARGs encoding resistance towards macrolide–lincosamide–streptogramin (MLS), tetracycline, aminoglycoside and bacitracin were the most abundant (Fig.
5b). Meanwhile, faecal samples from both antidepressant treatment groups exhibited high relative proportions of the aph3iiiA aminoglycoside resistance gene, whereas ermT among MLS resistance genes was more abundant in CUMS. Additionally, the tetO tetracycline resistance gene had low relative proportion in the Flu-treated rats (Fig.
5c, Supplementary Table 4). The category ‘Others’ represents ARGs that constituted <1% abundance in all samples. The overall patterns of ARGs were revealed by PCoA. Notably, the four groups could not be distinguished using PCoA, indicating that the differences among the groups were insignificant (Supplementary Fig. 7). Specifically, among 84 ARGs identified, 60 were shared in all samples.

Co-occurrence patterns between ARGs and bacterial assemblages were explored based on strong (ρ > 0.8) and significant (P < 0.01) correlations (Fig.
5d). The analysed topological network properties are summarised in Supplementary Table 5. The detailed co-occurrence between ARGs and microbial taxa are summarised in Supplementary Table 6. A previous study hypothesised that non-random co-occurrence patterns can be used as potential host information for ARGs when their abundance and co-existing microbial taxa are significantly similar between the different samples50. As shown in Fig.
5d and in Supplementary Table 6, the co-occurrence analysis results indicated that 12 bacterial genera may serve as the potential hosts for the 20 AGRs. Among these 12 genera, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 carried more diverse ARGs than the other genera, with connections observed with aminoglycoside resistance genes (aph3iiiA and ksgA), multidrug resistance gene (mdtN), and tetracycline resistance genes (tetO, tetPB, tetX). Additionally, the Parabacteroides and Bacteroides genera that were altered in the faecal microbiota analysis could be hosts of tetM genes, which encode tetracycline resistance.

To investigate the effects of Ami and Flu on the function of faecal microbiota, the data obtained from metagenomic analysis were annotated against the KEGG database. The highest abundance functional categories were associated with metabolism, which primarily consisted of carbohydrate, amino acid, energy, and nucleotide metabolism (Fig.
6a). Analysis of 6,101 KEGG orthologues (KOs) revealed that the relative abundance of 124 KOs notably differed between HC and CUMS groups. The 102 CUMS-enriched KOs were typically involved in the KEGG categories of ‘membrane transport’, ‘carbohydrate metabolism’, and ‘signal transduction’ (Fig.
6b, Supplementary Table 7). Ami and Flu treatment caused a difference in 54 and 70 KOs, respectively, compared to those in the CUMS group. Notably, following Ami intervention for 6 weeks, an apparent reduction was observed in the abundance in KOs related to ‘carbohydrate metabolism’, ‘signal transduction’, and ‘membrane transport’ (Fig.
6c and Supplementary Table 7). These results are consistent with the findings in Flu rats (Fig.
6d and Supplementary Table 7).

Additionally, using LEfSe analysis, we observed that pathways associated with translation (ribosome), drug resistance: antimicrobial (cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) resistance), amino acid metabolism (glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism), and metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides (terpenoid backbone biosynthesis) were decreased in Ami rats (Supplementary Fig. 11b), in agreement with the decreased functions in the HC group (Supplementary Fig. 11a). In contrast, pathways related to replication and repair (nucleotide excision repair) and immune system (NOD-like receptor signalling pathway) were enriched in the Ami group, consistent with the enriched functions in the HC group. Analysis of the Flu-treated CUMS rats revealed enrichment of only the ‘glutathione metabolism’ pathway, which was not observed in the HC group (Supplementary Fig. 11c).

Drugs can affect the function and composition of gut microbiome53. Most studies on antidepressants have focused on the effects associated with clinical symptoms of patients with depressive disorder, such as disturbances in sleep, appetite, and desire, as well as constipation, loss of the ability to experience pleasure in work or with friends, crying, suicidal thoughts, and slowing of speech and action2. However, very limited studies have evaluated the effects on intestinal microbiota25,27, and none have evaluated the influence of Flu or Ami on the structure and function of intestinal microorganisms under conditions of depressed hosts. In this study, Ami and Flu were shown to reduce the depressive symptoms of CUMS rats, including increasing the sucrose preference ratio, improving activity and exploration, and decreasing the time spent in the dark zone, suggesting the important roles of antidepressants in mediating the anxiety- and depression-like phenotype in CUMS rats. Data of 16S rRNA gene sequencing of faecal samples illustrated increased alpha-diversity in the bacterial communities of the antidepressant treatment groups compared to that in the CUMS rats. While bacterial diversity is believed to be important in host health, how the diversity of the microbiome affecting health remains largely unanswered54. More importantly, data on the potential association between depression and alpha-diversity are so far inconsistent. For example, Jiang et al.55 and Kelly et al.17 reported an increase in faecal bacterial alpha-diversity in depressed patients, whereas both Naseribafrouei et al.15 and Zheng et al.19 did not observe any significant alteration in human with depression. In the present study, beta-diversity analysis using weighted and unweighted UniFrac metrics revealed that the microbial communities in the CUMS group had a distinct composition compared with those in the HC rats, despite their access to similar food and water, supporting the potential impact of chronic stressors on the profile of gut microbiota. Then, the gut microbiota profiles of the Ami and Flu rats exhibited a separation from those of CUMS rats, suggesting that the antidepressant treatment condition constituted a critical factor accounting for the change in microbial structure. This finding is consistent with previous research demonstrating that antidepressant medication is an important source of inter-study variation regarding the gut microbiota composition of individuals56. Moreover, we identified that lower abundance of the phylum Firmicutes and higher abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes were associated with the drug-treatment effects of Ami and Flu, with that of the Flu group reaching a significant level. In comparison, data obtained from human studies and animal models have revealed that the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes proportion is decreased in lean compared to obese subjects and tends to increase with weight gain57,58. Additionally, several neurological diseases and inflammatory conditions have been related to an increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, such as autism spectrum disorders59–61and inflammatory bowel diseases62. Therefore, a reduced ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes appears to be associated with an improvement in neurological condition.

In summary, results from this study illustrated that CUMS-induced gut microbiota disruption in rats, with featured changes in community diversity, taxon abundance, and function profiles, along with in depressive symptoms. Administration of Ami and Flu reversed part of the gut microbiota profile and functions, in line with the antidepressant effects. Particularly, both antidepressant treatments led to an altered abundance of Porphyromonadaceae, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Alistipes. Ami and Flu treatments further modulated the abundance of several ARGs and potentially reduced carbohydrate metabolism in CUMS rats. Results from the study laid the foundation for further investigations to characterise the mechanisms of Ami and Flu as antidepressants, to identify the metabolites mediating the host responses, and to validate the causative relationship between gut microbiota dysbiosis and depression by demonstrating the function of the specific bacteria in hosts. Furthermore, so far antidepressant treatment-induced remission of depression remains an unsolved puzzle in disease therapy. Understanding the interaction between antidepressants and gut microbiota may open the door for innovative interpretation and potentially targeted intervention
