Gut–Skin Axis: Unravelling the Connection between the Gut Microbiome and Psoriasis

Evidence has shown that gut microbiome plays a role in modulating the development of diseases beyond the gastrointestinal tract, including skin disorders such as psoriasis. The gut–skin axis refers to the bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiome and skin health. This is regulated through several mechanisms such as inflammatory mediators and the immune system. Dysregulation of microbiota has been seen in numerous inflammatory skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis, rosacea, and psoriasis. Understanding how gut microbiome are involved in regulating skin health may lead to development of novel therapies for these skin disorders through microbiome modulation, in particularly psoriasis. In this review, we will compare the microbiota between psoriasis patients and healthy control, explain the concept of gut–skin axis and the effects of gut dysbiosis on skin physiology. We will also review the current evidence on modulating gut microbiome using probiotics in psoriasis.

Psoriasis is a non-contagious chronic inflammatory skin condition with a complex etiology that is relatively common in the general population, affecting men and women of all ages, regardless of ethnic origin, in all countries [1,2]. Psoriasis is a T cell mediated disease involving Th17 cells secreting interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-22 which are proinflammatory cytokines that causes proliferation of keratinocyte (KC) and activation of synoviocyte [3,4]. Psoriasis can be characterized by the hyperproliferation of the epidermal KCs, dysregulated KC differentiation, elevated vascularization and inflammation of the dermis and epidermis resulting in thickened, reddened skin appearing as a classic, well defined, erythematous scaly plaque that is itchy and flaky [5,6,7]. Although clinical findings are noticeable on the outer layer of the skin that is composed of KCs, the formation of psoriatic plaque is an interplay between different cell types (vasculature, innate, and adaptive immune cells) and KCs across the dermal layer rather than just the epidermal inflammation [8]. Risk factors of psoriasis include family history [9], smoking [10], obesity [11,12], infections [13,14], and medications [13]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly 100 million individuals globally are affected by psoriasis [1]. The reported prevalence in countries ranges between 0.09% and 11.4% [1,15]. Some studies find the prevalence rate of psoriasis could be affected by regions as Asians and some African populations showed lower prevalence rate as compared to Scandinavian and Caucasians that have prevalence rates as high as 11% [15,16,17]. However, one study found the correlation between psoriasis prevalence and geographic latitude to be very weak [18]. In terms of the mean age of onset of psoriasis, although there are variations across different studies, 75% of patients were <40 years old and 12% were between 50–60 years old [16].

In recent years, many studies have been investigating the connection between skin allostasis and homeostasis and the gastrointestinal health, with corroborative evidence showing strong bidirectional relationship between the skin and gut [34,35]. This can be seen through the presence of bacterial DNA translocation (BT) in blood samples of psoriasis patients that has been associated with the composition of gut microbiome in recent years, which proposes the new outbreaks of active plaque psoriasis could be correlated to circulating bacterial DNA in blood from the intestinal lumen [36]. The advancement in next generation sequencing technologies in the past few years has allowed us to have a better understanding on the intestinal microbiota composition [37], and the effects of these microbes may have on psoriasis pathogenesis. Hence, this review discusses the gut microbiome composition, diversity, and relative abundance of healthy and psoriasis individuals, explains the gut–skin axis and the effects gut dysbiosis has on the epithelial barrier, gut microbial metabolite and the gut immunoregulatory characteristics. We will also discuss the benefits of modulating gut microbiome using probiotics and how it can improve symptoms of psoriasis.

The skin is one of the largest organs of the human body. The skin plays a vital role in homeostasis in terms of water retention, temperature regulation, and protection of the body via skin regeneration process [38,39]. It also helps maintain a healthy microbial ecosystem via its production of antimicrobial proteins and peptides [40]. The role of homeostasis is highly dependent on the stratum corneum—the outermost layer of the epidermis—which is made up of 15 layers of tightly packed keratinized, anucleated, and stratified corneocytes differentiated from stem cells in the basal layer through the keratinization process [38,39,41,42].

There is a possibility that the modulatory effects of skin flora on inflammatory skin diseases may be associated with the gut microbiota. Imbalances of the composition of skin microbiota has been observed in numerous non-infective skin conditions such as psoriasis, acne vulgaris and rosacea, where gut dysbiosis were too, apparent in these conditions [34]. However, there is currently no evidence to show the direct causality of the association between gut dysbiosis and skin dysbiosis. In the following sections, we will discuss the possible mechanisms on how gut resident commensals affect skin health.

In recent years, an increasing number of studies are actively investigating the relationship between the gut microbiome and skin diseases, including psoriasis. This leads us to the concept of gut–skin axis which associates the microbiome and skin diseases via intestinal barrier, inflammatory mediators, and metabolites [21]. Currently there has been large evidence regarding the presence of the gut–skin axis and its resulting inflammatory effect due to gut microbiome imbalance [20]. The gut microbiome is mainly made up of a diverse bacterial species, but also contains protozoa, viruses, and fungi that reside mainly in the lower gut and help to maintain a symbiotic relationship with the host [58,59,60]. Aerobic species are commonly found in the small intestine whereas anaerobic species are common in the colon [61]. The few main bacterial communities in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) include Firmicutes, Bacteroidota (formerly known as Bacteroidetes), Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria phyla in which their composition is influenced by the host’s diet, age, and environmental conditions [62,63,64,65].

Gut dysbiosis activates the proinflammatory state via alterations to the metabolic environment and activation of specific pattern recognition receptors (PRPs) present on epithelial cells. This causes the gut permeability to increase as cytokines such as TNF alter the integrity of tight junctions between epithelial cells. The increase in epithelial permeability stimulates effector T cells activation, causing an imbalance between the T cells and Treg cells which leads to autoimmune diseases development. A positive feedback mechanism is involved as the proinflammatory cytokines magnifies the epithelial permeability, which further exacerbate chronic systemic inflammation and thus greater impairment to the intestinal barrier resulting in the entry of metabolites, toxins, and bacteria into the systemic circulation [34,73,98]. As these microorganisms enter the circulation, they could be activated, shedding their inflammatory cell wall components (lipoteichoic acid and lipopolysaccharide), possibly promoting or maintaining the pro-inflammatory state [99]. On top of that, gut dysbiosis can produce endotoxin-peptidoglycan superantigens to stimulate inflammatory and autoimmune states related to psoriasis. The microorganisms in the gut produce toxins triggering an immune response that causes psoriatic patients to present with positive detection of gut bacterial antigen in a skin test [100]. In line with this model, biomarkers for intestinal permeability such as claudin 3 and fatty acid binding protein are elevated in psoriasis patients [99].

The gut microbiome plays a role in the immunoregulatory characteristics of the gut. Gut microbes may produce or even increase the beneficial metabolites or specific immune modulating molecules such as polysaccharide A, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and retinoic acid via the fermentation of dietary fibers [73,101,102,103]. They are involved in the homeostasis between effector and regulatory T cells [73,102], aiding the anti-inflammatory responses via upregulation of lymphocytes and regulatory T cells [101]. However, the specific microbes involved in the modulation of these immune modulating molecules for such mechanism seen in psoriasis are yet to be distinguished [19]. The production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and trimethylamine can affect disease state and health status of a subject [76]. SCFAs have a role in protecting against the progression of certain inflammatory disease [103]. For example, propionate and butyrate produced by the gut microbiota have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties [104]. Butyrate has the key role of maintaining barrier integrity [105], as it can cease the activity of histone deacetylase causing a rise in regulatory cells which impacts wound healing and hair follicle stem cell differentiation [100]. Butyrate, which is also known to be primarily produced by Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, functions to decrease oxidative stress, supplies energy for colonocytes and triggers Treg cells, allowing anti-inflammatory action, hence, conferring immune tolerance to sites other than the GI system [106,107]. Consequently, a drop in both propionate and butyrate microbiota producers can trigger a proinflammatory state of the gut and affect the gut barrier integrity [108]. In addition, SCFAs are involved in the apoptosis and activation of immune cells. Evidence of chronic systemic inflammation demonstrated in animals is the main consequence of intestinal dysbiosis, due to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines causing epithelial to be more permeable and effector T cells to be activated [34,73]. By taking sodium butyrate as an example, it has important effects on tumor growth factors (TGF-β), protease enzymes, and cell cycle. Several studies showed that by exposing sodium butyrate to human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells, it prompts apoptosis by 50% via death receptors Fas upregulation accompanied with activation of caspases 3 and 8. It also helps in cell proliferation and terminal differentiation as demonstrated in the rise in expression levels of TGF-β and p52 [109].

In many microbiome-profiling studies, the diversity indices allow further characterization of microbiota population [110]. In terms of assessing the alpha diversity using Shannon’s Diversity index of the gut microbiome in psoriasis, a systematic review reported that in 8 out of 10 studies that looked at alpha diversity, most of them failed to demonstrate remarkable changes between psoriasis and normal control [21,102,111,112,113]. However, only one study among them showed increased diversity [108], two other studies showed lower diversity [114,115], and one study presented similar diversity but lower community richness in psoriatic samples when compared with normal controls [116]. There was also high variability in terms of Shannon’s biodiversity index of the psoriatic patients, in which bacterial DNA translocation positive psoriatic patients having a more stable and lower variability in diversity as compared to BT negative psoriatic patients. According to Codoner et al., in a human microbiome project of 300 healthy controls (HC) and 52 psoriasis subjects, the microbiome diversity of psoriasis patients was found to be greater than the healthy controls [108]. However, according to Scher et al. whose study involved only 17 HC, 15 psoriasis subjects, and 16 psoriatic arthritis subjects, results show psoriasis subjects had lower microbial diversity [114]. This is consistent with study conducted by Hidalgo-Cantabrana et al. which found that psoriasis patients presented with severe dysbiosis, a lower diversity of gut microbiota and an alteration of the relative abundance for some bacterial taxa [115]. Therefore, even with a similar alpha diversity index, microbial communities can still have a shift in composition without sharing any taxa [117]. To sum it up, there were no significant differences in alpha diversity between healthy controls and psoriasis individuals based on similar indices of most studies [21]. However, there are conflicting data regarding the alpha diversity which could be due to differences in sequence library preparation, DNA extraction, sample collection and data analyses [40]. Besides that, it is hypothesized that instead of the number of bacterial species, the differential abundance of bacteria may be the cause of gut dysbiosis in psoriasis [21].

On the other hand, beta diversity differed significantly between psoriasis and healthy controls in all studies included in the systematic review [21]. Having said that, it was reported that the differences in beta diversity achieve statistical significance only for psoriatic patients who have BMI < 25 [21].

In a study conducted by Codoner et al. which involves analyzing the feces of 52 psoriatic patients via 16S rRNA, an average of 85,000 sequences per sample was found and the “psoriasis microbiome” which is the defined microbial structure of psoriatic patients were different compared to healthy individuals. Hence, differing in gut microbial composition, which was reported to also be linked with BT [108].

In addition to bacteria, virus including the human papilloma virus and fungus for example Candida albicans and Malassezia have been connected to psoriasis [13]. The rise in these fungus and Staphylococcus aureus in both gut and skin has been linked with psoriasis exacerbations [13].

There are several treatments for psoriasis and antiproliferative is one of the focused methods in the past as it was thought that psoriasis occurred solely due to skin hyperproliferation. However, as more studies were conducted, the treatment for psoriasis shifted to targeting Th17 cells as there were higher levels of IL-17 found in psoriatic lesions. Th17 releases cytokines that stimulate IL10, IL20, and IL22 cytokines expression which results in keratinocyte hyperproliferation. This leads to more studies showing evidence that psoriasis is mainly driven by IL17/IL23/Th17 axis [131,132,133,134,135]. Hence, biologics targeting key cytokines, for instance, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and interleukin-23 (IL-23), is a treatment option for psoriasis [136,137,138,139]. Antibiotics, on the other hand, decrease susceptible bacterial species by changing the composition of microbiome, as well as potentially decreasing cardiometabolic comorbidities risk of psoriasis patients [140]. For instance, a study found that after antibiotics administration, TMAO drops then bounce back to baseline when antibiotics are ceased [141].

With the current evidence suggesting that systemic diseases can be modulated by altering the cutaneous and gut microbiome [19], further understanding of the role of gut microbiome in psoriasis could possibly lead to new therapies to be discovered. Currently, probiotics have been demonstrated to improve psoriasis by alteration of gut microbiota. The utilization of probiotics in psoriasis had shown to provide improvements but treatment using probiotics has yet to be standardized due to variations in studies in terms of the content of probiotic supplements and methods used [20,142,143]. By modifying the gut microbiome using dietary supplements such as prebiotics and probiotics, it could promote specific bacteria and help reshape the composition of our gut microbiome in the long term [140,144]. Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus are the common species used in probiotics [145], particularly the Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus are the two most commonly used strains in human health studies [146,147]. Other potential probiotics such as Actinobacteria have also been shown to be useful for gut microbiome modulation in aquaculture or animal studies [148,149,150].

Probiotics have low risk of adverse effects as the majority of probiotics with bacteria producing lactic acid are nontoxigenic and nonpathogenic. On top of that there have been >70 clinical studies conducted on food with microbial ingredients with results showing probiotics has no adverse effects [100,169,170]. Studies have shown that the use of probiotics and prebiotics can improve cathepsin-L-like activity level (a measure of skin keratinocyte differentiation and indicator of skin barrier function) skin hydration and decrease the level of serum and urine phenol which are toxic by-products of the gut bacteria [171,172]. Thus, it is a good alternative treatment for improving and managing psoriasis and its comorbidities, as well as reducing side effects related to chronic use of other psoriatic medications. Along with the advances in transdermal drug delivery systems, future research could look into administration of active compounds of probiotics that helps with psoriatic lesions through the trans-epidermal route [173].

Proteobacteria, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes makes up >98% of the gut microbiota and as mentioned earlier, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroides dropped while the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes rose in psoriasis patients which has been demonstrated by various studies [21]. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidota (previously known as Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes) (F/B) ratio is an important marker of the gut microbiota state [21], with several studies linking it with psoriasis comorbidities including obesity [174], nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [175], cardiovascular disease (CVD) [176], and insulin resistance [177]. For instance, high F/B ratio has been associated with CVD such as coronary artery disease [176]. The gut microbiome houses Proteobacteria and Firmicutes that convert dietary carnitine from eggs and red meat to trimethylamine (TMA), the precursor of pro-atherosclerotic metabolite trimethyl-amine-N-oxide (TMAO) which is a proatherogenic molecule independent of CVD risk factors [33,178,179]. TMAO changes cholesterol metabolism of the host and stimulates macrophage activation resulting in higher CVD risk, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death [141,178,180]. Besides that, it is proposed that TMAO is a candidate molecule for developing Type 2 diabetes mellitus. It was also found that high TMAO producers possess increased Firmicutes than Bacteroidota within stool samples [33].

Despite the observed differences in taxa seen in psoriasis patients compared to healthy individuals, there is a lack of consistency of results involving the microbial diversity, directionality of differences or relative abundance. Besides that, studies using fecal samples to determine changes in gut microbiome may not be able to detect microbiome changes occurring in the intestine due to variation in composition of luminal- and mucosal-link microbiota [21,194]. It also does not provide information on whether the taxon identified is transient and nonviable or remains pathogenic. To study the gut microbiome better, the concurrent use of several sampling technique including colonic lavage, intestine bioptates, and mucosal–luminal interface aspirates may be applied besides the 16SrRNA gene profiling [21]. Nonetheless, unlike fecal sampling, these are invasive procedures and must be carried out by registered health professionals to avoid complications such as infection, perforation, and bleeding.

Dysbiosis of the cutaneous and intestinal microbiome play important roles in pathophysiology of psoriasis. Several clinical studies and research have shown the effects of gut microbiome on the pathogenesis of psoriasis, host homeostasis, allostasis and its association with distant organs beyond the GIT.

Regardless, it is important to note that psoriasis is a heterogeneous disease, and the gut microbiome is dynamic which could vary due to gender, age, lifestyle, geographical background, diet, and medications. Alterations of gut microbiota could be affected by disease activity, comorbidities, disease duration, and treatment. All these could take time before it is seen which could possibly cause microbiome variations in both clinical and study participants, affecting the external validity. By further understanding the relationship between the gut microbiome and psoriasis pathogenesis, it is possible to develop novel prognosis and efficient treatment avenues. Modulation of the gut microbiome using probiotics could be a novel approach in preventing, managing, and even treating inflammatory skin diseases. Thus, maintaining a healthy gut microbiome is important to decrease intestinal permeability, decrease the risk of BT, and subsequently improve psoriasis.
