Targeting the gut microbiome: A brief report on the awareness, practice, and readiness to engage in clinical interventions in Qatar

Background: There has been a growing global interest in the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of diseases and the potentials of targeting the microbiome in clinical interventions. Very few clinical studies in Qatar focused on gut microbiome. This study aimed to assess the awareness of healthcare professionals, scientists, and the general public on the role of gut microbiota in health and diseases and, more specifically, in disorders of the gut–brain axis such as neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) or gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. It also aimed to evaluate the readiness of the population to engage in clinical trials involving dietary interventions or fecal transplants.

Conclusion: The study revealed that the role of gut microbes in health and diseases, and especially through the gut–brain axis, is still unclear in both the scientific community and general public. While acknowledging the importance of gut microbes, the lack of information regarding the link between lifestyle and gut microbes is considered to hold the public in the precontemplation/contemplation stages of the transtheoretical model of behavioral change. An interdisciplinary approach to new knowledge produced by microbiome studies is needed to run awareness campaigns and continue professional development activities on the benefits of lifestyle-based modulation of gut microbiome, thus engaging the general public in lifestyle changes and facilitating clinical research in human microbiome investigations in Qatar.

Health sciences are experiencing a paradigm shift with the growing interest in gut microbiome.1 With recent technological advancements and expanded funding for human microbiome research such as the ones provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through their extramural funding, databases are flooded with new data and information regarding the association of gut microbes with diseases.2 Today, evidence is pointing at important roles of gut microbes in metabolic diseases,3–6 neurological diseases,7–9 neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs),10,11 autoimmune diseases,12,13 cardiovascular diseases,14,15 and cancers.12,16 Many have tried eliciting ‘microbial prints’ for diseases, and associations have been described at the phylum and specie levels with some diseases or disorders. However, no consensus was reached as to which microbial composition can be salvatory for a disease.

We will conclude on the feasibility of running dietary interventions among children with ASDs or IBDs in Qatar and the need and benefits of running public awareness campaigns on the role of the gut microbiota in NDDs and health and diseases in general.

Two questionnaires were designed for HSs and the general public. Both questionnaires were distributed simultaneously to both communities and during the same period (between February and June 2018), which makes this an observational cross-sectional study.

Eligible participants were residents of Qatar who were over the age of 18 years and spoke English or Arabic. Parents were asked to fill survey for their minor children who fit in one of the three group studies (NDD, GI, or control). The questionnaire was developed based on the study objectives, and the institutional review board approved the study.

Links to online forms were distributed by email and social media across Qatar between February and June 2018. Some paper formats were distributed on the occasion of seminars in Qatar, and in this case, data collected were manually entered into the database.

A total of 44 HSs answered the HS questionnaire: 20 were involved in treating patients with ASD, ASHD, or IBD, 22 were not involved in treating patients with the previously mentioned disorders, and 2 did not answer this question.

NDD, neurodevelopmental disease; GI, gastrointestinal disease.

The repartition per condition among the participants from the public was as follows:

Descriptive analysis was performed using the International Business Machines Corporation - Statistical Package for the Social Sciences or IBM-SPSS software (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Comparisons of population proportions were conducted using the Fisher's exact test—in R statistical package—at 95% confidence interval (CI).

Of participants, 84.1% answered no, and only 15.9% thought that the HS community was knowledgeable to the question “Do you feel that healthcare professionals in Qatar are knowledgeable about the role of the gut microbiota in ASD, ADHD, IBD?” HS participants were also asked how much they knew about the role of the gut microbiota in diseases in general, and more than 95% admitted that they had minimum to no knowledge about it.

Participants from the general public were asked how they were born, and the results are depicted in Figure 2. Although our sample size was relatively small, and no definite conclusion can be drawn (Fisher's exact test p values were 0.3861 and 0.24, respectively, for NDD and GI), the trend observed in the higher proportion of C-section among the ASD population is worth mentioning and deserves further investigations in a local cohort while including other possible confounding factors such as presence of labor, candidiasis, and duration of breastfeeding.33

A growing number of studies have highlighted the potential of beneficial microbes in the prevention, treatment, and management of diseases, including ASD and IBD, in both preclinical and clinical studies.40–45 We asked our participants if they had ever heard of studies on the role of gut microbes in health and diseases, and 54% said that they did (data not shown), with a higher proportion of them being from the GI group (Fisher's exact test p value was 0.0523; odds ratio: 0.29; Figure 3A). Indeed, it makes sense that individuals with GI diseases or disorders are more likely to encounter and read scientific updates and studies on the microbiome by simply making searches on their own condition, which is already a GI disease. Similarly, they are also the ones who were aware, at a significantly higher proportion than the control, of the existence of clinical trials involving fecal microbiota transplants for their disease (Fisher's exact test p value was 0.01935; significant at p < 0.05, odds ratio: 0.226, 95% CI: 0.05359792–0.82876599; Figure 3B). This suggests that the chance of belonging to the GI group when one is aware of the existence of fecal transplants is 0.226 than for someone who is not.

An interesting study by Greenhough et al.47 highlighted the complexity of microbiome studies and how an interdisciplinary approach is fundamentally needed to raise awareness, involving social sciences and humanities, which could actually facilitate clinical studies and advances in microbiome studies. Greenhough et al.47 proposed an agenda that is a great source of inspiration for not only HSs but also members of other disciplines to tackle eight priorities on microbiome research, such as the impact of this new knowledge on healthcare governance and practice and how it affects agricultural practices, social behaviors, and, consequently, the environmental microbial homeostasis and health. With the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the relationships of humans and microbes have been questioned and been deeply affected by the use of chemicals such as sanitizers (with observation increase in resistance to chemicals in hands), microbiome convergence, and biodiversity decrease in some food plants.48,49

At the time of the investigation (2018), only 15.9% of the HSs who participated said that they have considered the implications of the gut microbiota in NDD or GI disorders during their practice. Approximately 31% said that they do discuss the role of the gut microbiome with their patients with an NDD or GI disorder. In addition, 47.7% of the same participants referred their patients to nutritionists or dieticians only if they have a GI disorder, whereas 13.6% systematically do it when they devise treatment plans for ASD, ADHD, or IBD. Interestingly, 53% of participating HSs reported having seen positive effects on their ASD/IBD patients after introducing a dietary change.

This important result about the role of early antibiotic exposure in the pathogenesis of autism has been reported by other studies. 55 Two metanalyses concluded that the data are conflicting and that the analyses need to also consider prenatal antibiotic exposures as strong associations. 56,57

Some studies mentioned that relocation to a new country was a factor that was associated with diseases such as ASD,58 pointing at the possible role of lifestyle habits.59 We have asked participants from the public whether their (or their child's) symptoms increased after their relocation to Qatar, and 75.4% indicated that symptoms did not noticeably increase, whereas 24.6% affirmed that they did. This question was not investigated among healthcare professionals.

On the other hand, participants from the public were asked few questions about their lifestyle habits, which were expected to reflect not only their awareness but also their readiness to engage in clinical interventions.

Growing evidence pointed the role of diet in shaping the gut microbiome and consequently the pathogenesis of diseases.26,28,60–64 The participants were asked about the proportion of processed food they eat (mentioned to them: bread, potatoes, rice, cookies, pastries, sweets, etc.). Interestingly, although previous data showed different awareness levels between the three groups, no significant difference was found between those groups when it comes to their diet type (Fisher's exact test p value was 0.3931 for NDD vs. control and 0.7438 for GI vs. control; Figure 5A).

This apparent contradiction is explained according to the principles of the transtheoretical model of behavioral change that participants, although aware of the importance of gut microbes in health and diseases, are still in the precontemplation stage.65 The reason might be that they do not fully understand the links between lifestyle, gut microbes, and health.

Probiotics have been recognized for their beneficial effects on health, and they are used as potential dietary supplements.66 Probiotic health benefits are not only limited to the intestinal tract but also include the amelioration of many diseases and disorders including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and neurobiological disorders.67–70 Studies showed that probiotics could alleviate some of the symptoms of autism and mood disorders by directly restoring the gut microbiota balance or other ways such as strengthening the GI barrier through intercellular adhesion tightening.71 Moreover, over the past decade, an increased public interest was given to the impact of diet and lifestyle choices on health. In this context, several studies reported a potential link between dietary factors and alterations in the epigenome and epigenetic pathways.72

Consumption of probiotics was used in our questionnaire to evaluate participants’ awareness on the benefits of probiotics for their condition. Overall, approximately 48% of participants stated that they were consuming probiotics regularly. Interestingly, the proportion of individuals who stated they were regularly consuming probiotics was lower in the NDD and GI groups than in the control group; however, Fisher's exact test p value was 0.5914, which is not significant (Figure 5B). A hypothesis would be that regular consumption of probiotics is mostly due to mediatization rather than deep understanding and awareness of the mechanisms of action.

Of healthcare professionals, 95.5% reported that they would consider recommending their patients additional treatment that target the microbiome such as probiotics and dietary plans.

To conclude about readiness, although the participants are aware of the importance of gut microbes in health and disease, these data suggest that overall, participants from the public were in the precontemplation/contemplation stage of the transtheoretical model of behavioral change, in which the patients are aware but not empowered to make a lifestyle change.65 Data suggest that families who deal with ASD or ADHD do not have a clear understanding of the impact of diet and probiotics on the condition, as the NDD group had the highest diet in processed grain-based food and the least intake of probiotics; however, this is not significant because of our sample size. Although this study shall be extended to evaluate the real situation, the public could benefit from popularization of scientific studies in the gut–brain axis.73

Some of the limitations of this study to consider are the relatively small sample size among the HS group (n = 44). Conclusions drawn about HSs need to be considered in this context. Nevertheless, the publication counts reported (Figure 1) still reflect a need to raise awareness among this group.

It would have been interesting to learn from healthcare professionals what their antibiotic prescription habits are for infants. However, this was not conducted in the study. Further explorations are needed to understand the role of early exposure to antibiotics in the pathogenesis of NDD and GI disorders.

As several axes of communication have been found from the gut to other organs than the brain–gut–skin,74 gut–liver,75 gut–pancreas,76 and gut–lung77 axes, we believe that instilling the current lifestyle awareness campaigns in Qatar with popularized versions of the latest microbiome studies would be a novel approach to engage the public in lifestyle changes targeting the gut microbiome, thus facilitating clinical studies in this area.

To conclude, this study highlights the needs and benefits of running awareness campaigns and continuing professional development activities on the benefits of lifestyle-based modulation in the gut microbiome.
