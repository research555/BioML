Stressful events induce long-term gut microbiota dysbiosis and associated post-traumatic stress symptoms in healthcare workers fighting against COVID-19



The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a key pathway perturbed by prolonged stressors to produce brain and behavioral disorders. Frontline healthcare workers (FHWs) fighting against COVID-19 typically experience stressful event sequences and manifest some mental symptoms; however, the role of gut microbiota in such stress-induced mental problems remains unclear. We investigated the association between the psychological stress of FHW and gut microbiota.

We used full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the longitudinal changes in gut microbiota and investigated the impact of microbial changes on FHWs' mental status.

Stressful events induced significant depression, anxiety, and stress in FHWs and disrupted the gut microbiome; gut dysbiosis persisted for at least half a year. Different microbes followed discrete trajectories during the half-year of follow-up. Microbes associated with mental health were mainly Faecalibacterium spp. and [Eubacterium] eligens group spp. with anti-inflammatory effects. Of note, the prediction model indicated that low abundance of [Eubacterium] hallii group uncultured bacterium and high abundance of Bacteroides eggerthii at Day 0 (immediately after the two-month frontline work) were significant determinants of the reappearance of post-traumatic stress symptoms in FHWs.

The lack of metabolomic evidence and animal experiments result in the unclear mechanism of gut dysbiosis-related stress symptoms.

The stressful event sequences of fighting against COVID-19 induce characteristic longitudinal changes in gut microbiota, which underlies dynamic mental state changes.

The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is still a global pandemic that has affected more than 200 countries. Healthcare workers, who relieve suffering and save lives on the frontline, are the most important force for solving this severe and urgent health crisis. Therefore, the World Health Organization highlights the fact that the protection of healthcare workers is a key step towards keeping patients safe. Besides the significantly higher proportion of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers than in the general population, the mental health problems suffered by healthcare workers due to the pandemic have received increasing attention(Kang et al., 2020; Pappa et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020, 2021; Yao and Xing, 2020).

Here, we firstly aim to explore the alterations of gut microbiota in FHWs with significant stress-related symptoms. Secondly, we want to identify the disturbing microbes playing a crucial role in long-term post-traumatic stress in FHWs through longitudinal association analysis between microbiota and mental status.

This is a publicly-registered clinical study described in the ClinicalTrials (No.: NCT04443075) and approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University (KYLLSL-2020–043). This study aimed to investigate the impact of stressful event sequences in the treatment of COVID-19 on the mental health and gut microbiota of FHWs. Gut microbiota and psychotic status were compared between 71 FHWs who had fought COVID-19 for two months in isolation wards in Wuhan, China, and 104 second-line healthcare workers (SHWs) who treated non-COVID-19-infected patients in routine hospitals. Moreover, dynamic changes in gut microbiota and psychotic status after exposure to the frontline medical work were delineated via a longitudinal investigation in FHWs at four time-points: immediately after they finished treatment and left the isolation wards (Day 0), after a two-week quarantine in a hotel (Day 14), four weeks after their return to normal life (Day 45), and a half year after the frontline work (Day 180). The process is shown schematically in Supplementary Fig. 1.

All participants were required (1) to be between 18 and 50 years old, (2) not to have taken antibiotics within 3 months before sample collection, (3) to have a body mass index (BMI) between 17.5 and 30. Participants were excluded if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) had serious cardiovascular, hematologic, and/or endocrine disease; (2) had a history of cancer; (3) had active gastrointestinal diseases and/or serious systemic diseases; (4) had a history of brain organic diseases and/or developmental delay; (5) had psychiatric disorders such as mood disorder and anxiety disorder, (6) pregnant or lactating, (7) drank alcohol in the past week (liquor > 250 mL or beer > 1 bottle) or the previous day (liquor > 50 mL or beer > 50 mL). All participants signed the informed consent after knowing the study details.

Depression, anxiety, sleep, psychopathology symptoms, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and somatic symptoms of participants were evaluated using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the 15-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15), respectively. Details of those psychological scales, lifestyle, and dietary habits assessment are described in the Supplementary Information.

Fresh fecal samples were collected and immediately stored in commercial tubes with fecal DNA preservation agents (MGIEasy Stool Sample Collection Kit, BGI, Wuhan, China) and then stored at −80 °C until DNA was extracted. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted using the E.Z.N.A.® Stool DNA Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, U.S.). The V1-V9 region of the bacteria 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR (95 °C for 2 min, followed by 27 cycles at 95 °C for the 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min) using primers 27F 5′-AGRGTTYGATYMTGGCTCAG-3′ and 1492R 5′-RGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′, where a barcode is an eight-base sequence unique to each sample. Amplicons were extracted from 2% agarose gels and purified using the AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, U.S.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Circular consensus sequence (CCS) libraries were prepared using SMRTbell™ Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA) and followed by immediate treatment with the Enzyme Clean Up Kit (PN: 101–843–100). The appropriate fractions for sequencing runs were identified on the Femto Pulse System (Agilent). After pooling the desired size fractions, the final libraries were further cleaned up and concentrated using AMPure PB beads (Pacific Biosciences PN:100–265–900). Finally, all libraries were checked for concentration using Qubit™ 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher PN: Q33231), and final size distribution was confirmed on the Femto Pulse. Purified SMRTbell libraries from the Zymo and HMP mock communities were sequenced on dedicated PacBio Sequel cells using the Sequencing Kit 2.0 chemistry. Purified SMRTbell libraries from the pooled and barcoded samples were sequenced on a single PacBio Sequel cell.

PacBio raw reads were processed using the SMRT Link Analysis software version 9.0 to obtain demultiplexed CCS reads with the following settings: minimum number of passes = 3, minimum predicted accuracy = 0.99. Raw reads were processed through SMRT Portal to filter sequences for length (<800 or >2500 bp) and quality. Sequences were further filtered by removing barcode, primer sequences, chirmas, and sequences if they contained 10 consecutive identical bases.

Clear reads were clustered into amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) at 100% similarity (identical) using the Deblur denoising algorithm, which removes noise due to sequencing error (Amir et al., 2017). Then single-read clusters were considered as poor-quality ASVs and discarded in further analysis. Clusters of identical sequences allowed us to detect microbial changes at fine scale resolution. The phylogenetic affiliation of each 16S rRNA gene sequence was analyzed by the uclust algorithm within the usearch v11 software package (https://www.drive5.com/usearch/) against the silva (SSU132) 16S rRNA database (Edgar, 2018). The optimal identity threshold of ASVs for approximated species was > 98.6% in this study (Edgar, 2018; Johnson et al., 2019).

Statistical analyses were performed using R (v4.0.2). Demographic analyses were performed using the R package CBCgrps (v2.8.1). Alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed using the vegan package (v2.5–7). Bray-Curtis distance matrix based on the composition at the ASV level was calculated in vegan and subsequently used to perform principal coordinates analysis (PCoA). Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was performed by adonis() function in the vegan package to compare Bray-Curtis distance between two groups. Fuzzy c-mean clustering was performed to depict different trajectories of gut microbiota using R package Mfuzz (v2.48.0). We calculated the within-cluster sum of squares for a range of cluster numbers, and the optimal number was chosen using the ‘elbow’ method. A random forest model with 10-fold cross-validation was performed (Feng et al., 2015) (R package randomForest, v4.6–14) to identify psychological scale-associated bacteria by the relative abundance of microbial species against four main psychological scales: IES-R, GAD-7, PHQ-9, PSQI.

Linear mixed models including age, sex, and BMI as covariates were computed in R using the lm base function after log10-transformation and Z-score scaling of the data. Compositional Lotka-Volterra (cLV) analyses were performed in Python (v3.8.8) to infer the network interactions of stress-associated bacteria using the online scripts published before (Joseph et al., 2020). Bacteria associated with stress at Day 0 were identified as perturbations. P-values of estimated effects were computed by the bootstrap method. Directed networks were visualized using Cytoscape software (v3.8.0). P-values and false discovery rates (FDR) by Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing corrections of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

First, psychological status and gut microbiota were compared between 71 FHWs and 104 SHWs. There were no significant differences in age, sex, and BMI between FHWs and SHWs (all P > 0.05, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). At Day 0, FHWs presented significant post-traumatic stress symptoms, sleep disorder, anxiety, and depression (all P < 0.001, Fig. 1 A). In addition, psychopathology symptoms and somatic symptoms in FHWs were more severe than those in SHWs (all P < 0.001, Supplementary Fig. 2).

We analyzed the gut microbiome from healthcare workers using full-length 16S rRNA sequencing. On average, 22,350 (standard deviation: 10,407) reads per sample were generated; 68.66% of these sequences are in the length of 1451–1500, suggesting that most of the reads are valuable (Supplementary Fig. 3A). Totally these reads were clustered into 40,809 ASVs, and we identified 6174 ASVs (with relative abundance higher than 0.001% and present in more than 10% of samples, Supplementary Table 3) for further analysis. The distributions of discarded and remaining ASVs were shown in Supplementary Fig. 3B. Alpha diversities measured using the Chao 1 index and observed ASVs were significantly lower in FHWs than in SHWs (all P < 0.05, Fig. 1B). Frontline work caused gut dysbiosis, characterized by compositional differences between FHWs and SHWs (P= 0.0001, Fig. 1C). Because SHWs were free to have meals they liked and wanted at home, while FHWs ate what was supplied by the local government at irregular times, there were differences in the regularity, balance, and structure of the diets between the two groups (all P < 0.01, Supplementary Table 2). Testing the influence of these variables on the gut microbiome, we found that BMI, diet regularity, and staple food structure affected the compositional difference, but stress exposure was indeed the strongest factor (R 2 = 0.024, P= 0.0002, Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 4).

To confirm whether disturbed gut microbiome recovered during the follow-up, we compared the alpha and beta diversities in FHWs with those in SHWs and found that Chao 1 index and number of observed ASVs temporarily recovered at Day 14 but continued to decrease after Day 14 and reached the lowest level at Day 180 (Supplementary Fig. 5A). In addition, Simpson and Shannon index decreased significantly at Day 180 (all P < 0.0001, Supplementary Fig. 5B). Compositional differences in gut microbiota between FHWs and SHWs persisted during the follow-up (all P= 0.0001, Supplementary Fig. 5C).

To further analyze the longitudinal changes of each cluster in FHWs, we compared the distance from each sample to its Day 0 status with that from each sample to the “healthy plane” (HP) based on each sample's PCoA coordinates of the Bray-Curtis distances within each cluster. All clusters, except for cluster 3, were closer to HP at each time point, indicating that their microbial profile was similar to the HP. Of note, cluster 3 at Day 14 exhibited a similar distance to Day 0 and the HP (Supplementary Fig. 7), suggesting that distinctive changes happened at Day 45. Moreover, both distances to Day 0 and the HP increasing with time indicated that each cluster of FHWs did not change toward Day 0 status or the HP but toward another disease status that could be referred to as post-traumatic stress because FHWs had post-traumatic stress at Day 180.

To determine if the psychological impact in FHWs returned to baseline, we compared psychological scales in FHWs at each time point with those in SHWs. This analysis revealed that most stress-associated symptoms such as anxiety and depression recovered at Day 14 (all P > 0.05, Fig. 3 A,B), and did not reappear after Day 14. IES-R recovered at Day 14 (P > 0.05, Fig. 3C) and PSQI recovered at Day 45 (P > 0.05, Fig. 3D). It should be noted that both post-traumatic stress and sleep disorders in FHWs reappeared at Day 180 (both P < 0.05, Fig. 3C,D).

To identify the species associated with stress symptoms, we used random forest regression of species against each psychological scale in the complete series at four time points. Five repeats of 10-fold cross-validation led to the optimal selection of 24 species for GAD-7, 33 for IES-R, 27 for PHQ-9, and 12 for PSQI, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 8). In total, 59 species were identified (Fig. 3E, Supplementary Table 6). Most species were from the genus [Eubacterium] eligens group, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, and Streptococcus in Cluster 6 (genera with continuing decline). Other common species were from Bifidobacterium and Sutterella in Cluster 4 (genera with lowest relative abundance at Day 45), and the Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group in Cluster 3 (genera that increased from Day 45 to Day 180).

Sleep disorder in FHWs at Day 180 was possibly caused by many factors, but post-traumatic stress symptoms were specifically induced by the fight against COVID-19 and were a key mental disturbance in FHWs. Therefore, to examine the role of the gut microbiome in the reappearance of post-traumatic stress symptoms, we explored the associations between species changes and psychological scale changes using two steps. First, we performed random forest regression by the relative abundance of species at Day 0 against changes in IES-R scores from Day 45 to Day 180. Four species were selected by the model; also, significant differences between FHWs at Day 0 and SHWs were noted (all corrected P < 0.01, Fig. 4 A, Supplementary Table 7). These four species were possible inducers of post-traumatic stress. Second, we used linear mixed models, with age, sex, and BMI as covariates, to analyze associations between microbial changes and changes in IES-R scores from Day 45 to Day 180 (delta association). Ten species with P < 0.05 were identified using the mixed models; these species were present in more than 20% of samples (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Table 8).

Additionally, we identified two species, Dialister invisus DSM 15,470 and Acinetobacter sp. CIP 101,966, which had predictive value in the reappearance of sleep disorder in FHWs at Day 180 (Supplementary Table 10) and also correlated negatively with the changes of PSQI score (Supplementary Table 11) using the two-step method. Dialister invisus DSM 15,470 was depleted in FHWs at Day 0 (Supplementary Table 7), which suggests its beneficial effect in sleep disorders. Acinetobacter sp. CIP 101,966 were enriched in FHWs at Day 0, but it had no significant antagonistic effect with Dialister invisus DSM 15,470 in the interaction networks (Supplementary Fig. 10, Supplementary Table 12); it had few connections, suggesting that its role was not as important as Dialister invisus DSM 15,470.

Our investigations in FHWs provide a unique opportunity to understand the impact of a special type of chronic stress exposure on the human gut-brain axis. As chronic stress is harmful to human health, randomized controlled human studies using stress factors as exposure factors are not allowed by medical ethics principles. Investigations on survivors and victims who have encountered disasters, such as earthquakes and massacres, are mainly used to base studies of the subsequent development of mental health problems and related human neurobiology of stress (Dyb et al., 2014; Lai et al., 2017). As all patients infected with COVID-19 in China were transferred to isolation wards, FHWs who were involved in their treatment over two months experienced typical stressful event sequences. The increased prevalence of mental symptoms in the healthcare workers in our study and those in several other studies (Huang et al., 2020; Pappa et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020; Yao and Xing, 2020), suggest that healthcare workers who treated COVID-19-infected patients faced vast amounts of stress. As the city where we recruited our participants was locked down before our study started, SHWs who experienced similar stress levels at work and in life before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 were included as controls. Although the two cohorts of healthcare workers were not randomly assigned, they had the same occupations and similar demographic features and socioeconomic status; thus, differences in gut microbiota can be attributed to exposure to stressful event sequences.

In conclusion, this study illustrates the stressful event sequences-induced characteristic profile of gut microbiota and dynamic changes in bacterial composition in humans, which provides a better understanding of the gut bacterial architecture of stress-induced mental disorders and highlights potential targets for future interventions.
