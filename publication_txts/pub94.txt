Can You Trust Your Gut? Implicating a Disrupted Intestinal Microbiome in the Progression of NAFLD/NASH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of disorders, ranging from fatty liver to a more insulin resistant, inflammatory and fibrotic state collectively termed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In the United States, 30%–40% of the adult population has fatty liver and 3%–12% has NASH, making it a major public health concern. Consumption of diets high in fat, obesity and Type II diabetes (T2D) are well-established risk factors; however, there is a growing body of literature suggesting a role for the gut microbiome in the development and progression of NAFLD. The gut microbiota is separated from the body by a monolayer of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) that line the small intestine and colon. The IEC layer is exposed to luminal contents, participates in selective uptake of nutrients and acts as a barrier to passive paracellular permeability of luminal contents through the expression of tight junctions (TJs) between adjacent IECs. A dysbiotic gut microbiome also leads to decreased gut barrier function by disrupting TJs and the gut vascular barrier (GVB), thus exposing the liver to microbial endotoxins. These endotoxins activate hepatic Toll-like receptors (TLRs), further promoting the progression of fatty liver to a more inflammatory and fibrotic NASH phenotype. This review will summarize major findings pertaining to aforementioned gut-liver interactions and its role in the pathophysiology of NAFLD.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), once known as the “un-named” disease, afflicts 80–100 million Americans and is currently the most common cause of chronic liver disease (1). About 20%–30% of NAFLD cases in the United States fall under the more severe category of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (1). With increasing prevalence over the last 20 years, NAFLD presents a burgeoning health problem. Unfortunately no therapies are currently approved for treatment or prevention of NAFLD/NASH. Development of such a therapeutic requires more in depth understanding of this disease, including answers to questions such as: What factors influence progression of steatosis to NASH, to NASH with fibrosis? What predisposes 30% of NAFLD patients to develop NASH? Can we harness pre-disposing factors and other non-invasive methods to accurately predict disease progression?

NAFLD covers a wide range of liver morbidities, with accumulation of lipid droplets being its mildest manifestation, and liver failure or cirrhosis being the worst. When the accumulation of lipid droplets exceeds 5% of the total liver weight, an individual may be characterized as having fatty liver, hepatic steatosis, or non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) (1). About 30% of individuals with NAFL progress to NASH which is characterized by inflammation in addition to lipid accumulation (2). About 20% of NASH patients with advanced fibrosis will progress to cirrhosis, which marks an irreversible decline in liver function, in addition to being a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (2).

On top of a complex etiology, tracking progression of NAFLD is an additional challenge. Serum ALT and fibrosis score are surrogate markers to determine liver damage; however, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosing and characterizing the different stages of NASH (5). Less invasive alternatives, such as ultrasonography and MRI, allow for visualization of fatty liver, but do not evaluate inflammation or accurately assess fibrosis (6). Limited functionality makes these techniques less viable alternatives as disease development/progression indicators. To complement imaging, biomarker research is an active area of the NAFLD/NASH field. The gut microbiome composition or associated metabolites could be one such biomarker, although additional research is needed to confirm the utility of these approaches.

Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) studies have implicated the microbiome and NAFLD development in mice (7, 8). However, no particular microbial signature has emerged in human NAFLD, making it difficult to trace disease development back to any particular cluster of bacterial taxa. Sharpton et al. reviewed the reasons behind discordant results obtained from studies trying to draw correlations between the microbiome and human NAFLD (9). A number of confounders could underlie why no one signature has emerged across multiple studies, including differences in patient age, presence of other metabolic co-morbidities, and geographic location. Differences in handling of stool samples, sequencing and statistical analyses performed also could skew the results of individual studies (9). Additionally, compared to 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, metagenomic analysis allows for a better understanding of the functional and metabolic potential of the gut microbiome (9).

In contrast to simple steatosis, identification of microbial signatures in NASH with fibrosis is less well established, in part due to differences in the threshold for “fibrosis” between studies. For example, some human fibrosis studies have made comparisons between mild to moderate (F0-F2), versus severe fibrosis (F3-F4), while some others have compared no to little fibrosis (F0-F1) to moderate and severe fibrosis (F2-F4), which has created discrepancies in the literature (15, 17). Even then, microbial signatures associated with advanced fibrosis have emerged. In general, advanced fibrosis correlated with increased Gram-negative bacteria, increased Fusobacteria phylum, and decreased Enterobacteriaceae family and Gram-positive bacteria, Firmicutes phylum, Prevotellaceae family, and Prevotella genus (15, 17, 20). One of these studies utilized metagenomic sequencing along with serum metabolomics which allowed the authors to overlay bacterial abundance with pathway and metabolite enrichment data. This approach provided a more holistic microbial profile of patients with mild/moderate fibrosis, and severe fibrosis with NASH (17). While the gut microbiome signature was consistent with previous studies, serum metabolite analysis revealed increased nucleoside metabolism in severe fibrosis and increased amino acid and carbon metabolism related metabolites in mild/moderate fibrosis (16). In terms of pathway enrichment, mild/moderate fibrosis stool samples were enriched in nucleotide and steroid degradation pathways, while severe fibrosis stool samples were enriched in carbon metabolism and detoxification pathways (19). These data suggest the possibility of harnessing the microbiome to differentiate mild/moderate fibrosis from severe fibrosis with NASH. More studies with the same study design and larger cohort sizes are needed to confirm whether these microbiome-derived signatures can truly be used as a diagnostic tool.

The human diet is enriched in all three macronutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fat, with carbohydrates making up a bulk of the standard diet. Dietary carbohydrates come in three forms, polysaccharides, disaccharides, and monosaccharides, as defined by the number of monomeric units. In order to be used as energy sources by the host, poly- and disaccharides must first be broken down to their monosaccharide units. Of all the enzymes required for this hydrolysis to occur, humans only encode amylase which removes monosaccharide units from starch. Other than amylase, the host depends on the gut microbiome to harvest energy from dietary polysaccharides (25). Non-starch polysaccharides such as cellulose or hemicellulose are metabolized by colonic bacteria to generate short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, acetate, and propionate (25, 26). Analysis of feces originating from germ-free (GF) mice revealed significantly reduced levels of SCFAs in the intestine and cecum when compared to conventional mice, supporting the need for commensal bacteria to metabolize non-digestible carbohydrates to generate SCFAs (27). Microbial-produced monosaccharides and SCFAs are absorbed into the portal vein and serve as substrates for de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in the liver. So far, 130 families of glycoside hydrolases, 22 families of polysaccharide lyases and 16 families of carbohydrate esterases have been discovered, and a vast majority of these are encoded in microbial genomes (28). In addition, metagenomic sequencing of human gut microbiota has uncovered a vast panel of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) including hydrolases, lyases and esterases, a great majority of which remain to be characterized (25).

From a translational perspective, there are limited human data on any of these mechanisms in fatty liver development. The literature suggests that obese individuals have increased intestinal glucose absorption, but this has not been tied back to the microbiome (31). Monosaccharide transporters might be potential targets, but selection will be a challenge as the GLUT family of transporters alone has 14 members. The SCFA receptors GPR41 and GPR43 show functional divergence when it comes to differentiation of adipocytes, but whether these differences also apply to their role in SCFA uptake is largely unknown (32). In addition, there are no human data on the expression of these receptors in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in metabolic disease. Lastly, enrichment of glycoside hydrolase metagenomic signatures in obese mice and humans unable to lose weight on a lifestyle intervention program holds translational promise, but the functional value of these signatures remains to be identified in humans (33, 34). One way to assess functionality would be to measure if microbiome-derived acetate feeds into hepatic DNL as a result of increased expression of glycoside hydrolase in obesity, but this may not be that straight-forward in humans. One potential “fix” for removing glycoside hydrolase-rich microbial populations could be to re-populate the obese gut with FMT from healthy donors. In fact, there currently are clinical trials using this technique to evaluate its impact in NAFLD (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02469272).

Hepatic DNL is the process by which excess carbohydrates in the liver are converted to neutral TGs and stored in lipid droplets. Depending on the energy state of the cell, these TGs are either packaged into very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and secreted out of the liver or are hydrolyzed to undergo β-oxidation. As such, DNL has two components; synthesis of free fatty acids (FFAs) and incorporation of 3 FFAs onto 1 glycerol to form one molecule of tri-acyl glycerol (TAG). Substrates for DNL are sourced from both the host in the form of FFA flux from the adipose tissue, and also microbiome-derived metabolism of carbohydrates and fatty acids from the diet.

In their recent paper, Zhao et al. set out to tease apart the relative contribution of these two pathways in fructose consumption-mediated increases in hepatic DNL (45). Counter to current dogma surrounding the role of dietary fructose in hepatic steatosis, Zhao et al. demonstrated that dietary fructose is converted to acetate by the gut microbiome, and can be used by the liver as a precursor for DNL (45). Prior to these data, it was believed that once in the hepatocyte, fructose enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and is converted to citrate. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) converts citrate to acetyl-Coa which serves as a precursor for DNL. By knocking out ACLY, Zhao et al. demonstrated that dietary fructose can still contribute to the NAFLD phenotype by bacterial conversion to acetate, followed by transport to the liver via the portal vein. In the liver, acetate is converted to acetyl-Coa by acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACSS)-2 and is ultimately shunted into the lipogenic pathway. Finally, gene expression of ChREBP-β and other DNL genes is upregulated upon fructose feeding independently of acetyl-CoA metabolism. Collectively, these data indicate dual mechanisms for fructose-mediated hepatic lipogenesis- one via activation of the transcriptional DNL program, and another by providing DNL substrates in the form of microbiome-derived acetate.

Clues for the role of bile acids (BA) in TG synthesis came in the 1970s when administration of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) for gallstones also resulted in reduced circulating TGs (46). Conversely, patients treated with BA sequestrants were found to have elevated hepatic and serum TGs and VLDL (47). Bile acid synthesis from cholesterol which occurs exclusively in the liver is mediated by two key enzymes- CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, which through a series of reactions catalyze the production of CDCA and cholic acid (CA) respectively (48). CDCA is further converted to α, then β-muricholic acid (β-MCA) in mouse livers and into ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in human livers. These primary BAs are further conjugated in the liver to the amino acids taurine or glycine to generate conjugated BAs such as taurocholic acid (TCA), tauro-alpha/beta-muricholic acid (T-α/β-MCA), etc. (49). Primary BAs are then stored in the gallbladder, wherein they are released upon meal ingestion to facilitate absorption of nutrients across the small intestine (SI). Approximately, 95% of BAs are reabsorbed in the ileum and are acted upon by gut microbiota to undergo de-conjugation by the bacterial enzyme bile acid hydrolase (BSH) and further dehydroxylation by bacterial dehydroxylases to generate the secondary BAs lithocholic acid (LCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA) from CDCA and CA, respectively (50). Therefore, the gut microbiota plays a key role in maintaining BA composition, and will likely be impacted by any perturbations in microbiome composition.

Takeda G protein-coupled Receptor 5 (TGR5) is a G-protein coupled receptor which is less abundant than FXR, but is still highly expressed in the gallbladder, ileum, colon, and on hepatic macrophages known as Kupffer cells (53). As a GPCR, TGR5 activation leads to increase in cyclic AMP levels, thereby increasing the expression of protein kinase A which further mediates downstream effects. BAs activate TGR5 in the order of LCA > DCA > CDCA > CA, implying that TGR5 signaling is strongly associated with the microbiome as both LCA and DCA are products of the microbiome (53). TGR5s key role in the intestine is to facilitate secretion of the incretin hormone GLP-1 from enteroendocrine cells therefore increasing the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells (67). In addition to imparting other metabolic benefits, the administration of GLP-1 agonists in ob/ob mice significantly reduced hepatic steatosis, both by driving down DNL, and up-regulating fatty acid oxidation (68) ( Figure 2 ). Clinical trials with TGR5 agonists are currently underway for the treatment of NASH, and hold promise due to TGR5’s influence on GLP-1 signaling.

The gut barrier is the first line of defense between intestinal luminal contents and circulation, and mostly consists of the epithelial barrier and the over-laying mucus layer. The epithelial barrier consists of a monolayer of adjacently aligned epithelial cells, a vast majority of which are enterocytes/colonocytes. This layer is also interspersed with four other epithelial cell types—goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells, and microfold cells (69). Underneath the epithelial cell monolayer is the lamina propria, which houses innate and adaptive immune cells such as T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (70). Finally, under the lamina propria lies a vascular network that eventually converges into the portal vein which, in turn, empties into the liver.

While the above data paints A. muciniphila as a good player, another study showed that consuming diets depleted of fiber led to significant proliferation of A. muciniphila, correlating with a significant reduction in colonic mucus thickness and a compromised gut barrier (28, 98). While it is unclear why A. muciniphila appears to be a negative component of the microbiome in this study, it is possible that consuming a diet low in fiber deprives A. muciniphila and associated cross-feeders of classic substrates. A known mucus degrader, it is possible that A. muciniphila instead shifts its metabolism to use mucus as a substrate, thereby feeding into a cycle of mucus consumption, reduction in mucus thickness and increased proliferation. Eventually, when mucus consumption exceeds production, a scarcity of substrate availability results, and the population of A. muciniphila declines. It is possible then, that reduced A. muciniphila population size in diabetic patients is a consequence, rather than cause of compromised gut integrity. This might also be the reason why pasteurized forms of A. muciniphila show an improvement in metabolic endpoints, because this form does not have mucus degrading activity. A prospective study where A. muciniphila populations are measured from the onset to full- fledged development of diabetes might be able to answer some of these questions, but until then, the jury is out on the role of A. muciniphila in gut barrier integrity.

The previous section elucidates how gut microbiome dysbiosis occurring during metabolic syndromes can alter intestinal biology to make the gut more permeable. This allows passive transport of microbial PAMPs from the intestinal lumen into the portal vein, and eventually the liver ( Figure 2 ). Before diving into how PAMPs contribute to NASH, it is first important to appreciate its pathophysiology. As mentioned, the first step of NAFLD is almost always the development of fatty liver. The second step involves multiple hits like IR, increased gut permeability, inflammation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production which leads to the progression of a more inflammatory, fibrotic NASH phenotype. Progression of fatty liver to fibrosis affects all liver cell types (99). While hepatocytes appear injured and undergo a form of cell death termed apoptosis, the resident liver macrophages, Kupffer cells (KCs), start secreting pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. Finally, quiescent stellate cells (SCs), which are the major storage site for retinoids, are activated (99). Activation of stellate cells leads to loss of retinoids and increased expression of signaling receptors including the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) receptor. Activated SCs proliferate and secrete extracellular matrix proteins to form a fibrous scar, which imparts a “fibrotic” phenotype to NASH (99). PAMP receptors such as the toll-like and nod-like receptors (TLRs and NLRs) are expressed on the cell surface of hepatocytes, Kupffer cells (KCs), and stellate cells (SCs), and are known to contribute to the inflammatory and fibrotic phenotype of NASH ( Figure 2 ). While suppressed in healthy liver, TLR signaling is activated in the presence of pathogenic microorganisms and bacteria-derived molecules. Since other reports have already reviewed the role of TLRs in NAFLD in great detail, this section will briefly highlight some of the major findings (100, 101).

In conclusion, with the exception of TLR5, hepatic TLRs, upon binding by gut bacteria-derived products, set into motion a cascade of inflammatory and fibrotic signals, thereby abetting the progression of fatty liver to NASH.

Increasingly, alterations in the gut microbiome have been correlated with NAFLD progression. This remains an important discussion in microbiome research relating to NAFLD for several reasons. Firstly, a unique microbial signature associated with the different phenotypes within NAFLD could serve as a non-invasive tool for accurately determining severity of disease. Secondly, predicting disease progression and prognosis will be easier and less invasive, in comparison to performing a liver biopsy each time an individual comes into the clinic for follow-up. Thirdly, a unique microbial profile in NAFLD overlaid with metagenomic signatures will help predict host metabolic responses, leading to more personalized interventional approaches. Lastly, therapeutically shifting a “disease promoting” microbiome to an “anti-NAFLD/NASH” microbiome remains an attractive strategy for thwarting or reversing the course of NAFLD progression.

As far as translational application of the microbiome in the treatment of NAFLD is concerned, a clinical trial is currently underway that aims at repopulating the gut microbiome of NASH patients via FMT from lean donors (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02469272). The primary end-point of the study at the end of the 12-week FMT period is degree of hepatic steatosis as determined by MRI. The secondary end points are liver function tests and markers of insulin sensitivity. Data from this study will provide preliminary clues on the safety, viability, and efficacy of the use of FMT for the treatment of NASH. Follow-up large-scale studies will be required to truly validate any beneficial findings before FMT is considered as a therapeutic intervention for NASH.
