Effect of Baicalin-Aluminum Complexes on Fecal Microbiome in Piglets

The gut microbiome has important effects on gastrointestinal diseases. Diarrhea attenuation functions of baicalin (BA) is not clear. Baicalin–aluminum complexes (BBA) were synthesized from BA, but the BBA’s efficacy on the diarrhea of piglets and the gut microbiomes have not been explored and the mechanism remains unclear. This study has explored whether BBA could modulate the composition of the gut microbiomes of piglets during diarrhea. The results showed that the diarrhea rate reduced significantly after treatment with BBA. BBA altered the overall structure of the gut microbiomes. In addition, the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that the functional differentially expressed genes, which were involved in the top 30 GO enrichments, were associated with hydrogenase (acceptor) activity, nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase activity, and isocitrate lyase activity, belong to the molecular function. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that flagellar assembly, bacterial chemotaxis, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC) transporters, biosynthesis of amino acids, and phosphotransferase system (PTS) were the most enriched during BBA treatment process. Taken together, our results first demonstrated that BBA treatment could modulate the gut microbiomes composition of piglets with diarrhea, which may provide new potential insights on the mechanisms of gut microbiomes associated underlying the antimicrobial efficacy of BBA.

Post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) is thought to be one of the most important diseases for the modern pig industry worldwide because it causes serious financial losses [1]. There are many factors related to diarrhea of piglets. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) (ETEC) is generally considered to be an important factor associated with PWD of piglets [2]. In addition, previous reports showed that stress factors during weaning period might negatively regulate the response to immune system which could result in alteration of intestinal flora and dysfunction [3,4]. Antibiotics are commonly utilized for controlling PWD of piglets [5]. However, there is a concern that long-term utilization of antibiotics may lead to drug resistance [6] and risk of residue in the human body through food transmission [7]. Therefore, currently developing a new Chinese herbal medicine has become an important approach to solve the diarrhea in piglets.

In this study, thirty piglets with PWD were chosen to explore the efficacy of BBA on the treatment of diarrhea and the structural changes of the gut microbiomes in response to the treatment with BBA. The results demonstrated that the rate of diarrhea among piglets reduced significantly after treatment with BBA, and BBA could modulate the composition of gut microbiomes of piglets by metagenomic analysis, which may provide new potential insights on the mechanisms of gut microbiomes associated underlying the anti-microbiological efficacy of BBA.

During clinical observation, on the day with the piglets administrated with BBA, the diarrhea rates of the piglets significantly reduced compared with the untreated group (Figure 1) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, on the third day, no clinical symptoms of piglets with BBA treatment were observed, but the untreated group still displayed diarrhea (Figure 1).

In this study, the metagenomic sequencing analysis was used to detect the structural changes in the gut microbiomes in the two groups before and after treatment with BBA or not. The results showed that high-throughput metagenomic sequencing produced 562,699,940 clean reads from 6 stool samples with 93,783,323 ± 11,256,477 sequences per sample (Table 1, Supplemental Table S1).

Principal components analysis (PCA) analysis method was utilized to explore the relationship between the numerous samples and multivariate data [24]. The results demonstrated that most of the samples from BBA treatment group and control group emerged a mixed distribution with not falling into a single cluster (Figure 3). Furthermore, we found that the Non-supervised Orthologous Groups (eggNOG), module, and species of taxonomy changes of samples exhibited some disperse, but they were fully distinguished from each other (Figure 3C,G,I).

From the species community structure diagram, we found that Bacteroidetes, Clostridiaceae, and Ruminococcaceae were the main microbiomes which exhibited the most important components of the piglets’ gut microbiomes with diarrhea (Figure 4). After the piglets’ treatment with BBA, the microbiomes were changed and Proteobacteria, Euryarchaeota, and Fusobacteria were the most important components of gut microbiomes of piglets, which suggested that BBA could modulate the components of gut microbiomes (Figure 4). The genus level, phylum level, and species level were shown in Figure 5, Supplemental Figure S1. The phylum level of taxonomy analysis demonstrated that Viruses noname, Proteobacteria, Euryarchaeota, and Fusobacteria were increased, while Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were decreased in the piglets treated with BBA compared with before BBA administration (Figure 5B).

The heatmap of taxonomy comparison analysis at the genus, phylum, and species level were also displayed. The results demonstrated that, at the genus level, Fusobacterium, Lactobacillus, Prevotella, and Escherichia were predominant in each group (Figure 6A). After the piglets treated with BBA, the Prevotella, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides were significantly reduced (Figure 6A). However, Fusobacterium and Campylobacter were increased (Figure 6A). In addition, mortiferum from Fusobacterium coli from Campylobacter and Escherichia significantly increased at the species level, while stercorea from Prevotella delbrueckii from Lactobacillus decreased compared with piglets before BBA administration (Figure 6C).

To better understand the microbe response to BBA treatment, the enrichment analysis using Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was performed. The GO enrichment analysis demonstrated that the functional differentially expressed genes which were involved in the top 30 GO enrichments were associated with hydrogenase (acceptor) activity, nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase activity, and isocitrate lyase activity, belonged to the molecular function (Supplemental Figure S2A). Choline metabolic process, cell adhesion involved in single-species biofilm formation, and arabinose transport belonged to the biological process (Supplemental Figure S2A). Viral assembly intermediate belonged to the cellular component (Supplemental Figure S2A). Further, the top 30 pathways screened as enrichment in the microbiomes of the piglets treated with BBA by KEGG were displayed in Supplemental Figure S2B. Flagellar assembly, bacterial chemotaxis, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, ABC transporters, biosynthesis of amino acids, and phosphotransferase system (PTS), were the most enriched during BBA treatment process, which suggested the key importance of the signaling pathways upon gut microbiomes modulation.

In this study, BBA significantly reduced diarrhea compared with the control group; therefore, it could be used in effective treatment of piglets with diarrhea. Previous research has reported that BA could attenuate the diarrhea in rats and pathological lesions of intestine induced by food allergy [25]. The active compound, baicalin, displayed effectiveness in the treatment of bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) which may inhibit inflammation and enhance immune responses in the host during virus infection process [26]. In addition, baicalin could improve the infections diarrhea of piglets which change the metabolism of components in the diarrheal intestinal flora [27]. BBA was synthesized from BA, but the BBA’s efficacy on the gut microbiomes has not been explored. In this study, BBA displayed significant efficacy on inhibiting diarrhea of piglets, and we first demonstrated that BBA modulated the overall gut microbiomes compositions of piglets with diarrhea, which might be served as a promising candidate for use in the diarrhea treatment.

Taken together, our results first showed that BBA could modulate the changes of gut microbe communities and subsequently contributed to alleviating diarrhea of piglets. Our study found a new effect of BBA in easing the rate of diarrhea, which may provide a novel therapy target for controlling diarrhea of piglets.

Baicalin-aluminum complexes (BBA) are synthesized by Institute of Animal Health Products, Wuhan Polytechnic University. The BBA was obtained by the methodology which was used to prepare Huangqinsulv capsules (WS3-B-1425-93). BBA was prepared by the reaction of an extraction of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and alums in water, at pH 7.0 (regulated by Na2CO3), under constant stirring for 15 min. Following filtration and washing with water and ethyl alcohol, the BBA was isolated as an orange powder and being dried in a desiccator under vacuum. When used, 13.6 g BBA per pack was dissolved using 50 mL normal saline.

This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the China Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals 1988 and the Hubei Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals 2005. This study was performed in a commercial farm. Thirty 10-day-old, weighing 4–4.3 kg, naturally farrowed early-weaned (NFEW) piglets (Duroc × Landrace × large white) which were suffering from diarrhea were chosen and used for in vitro experiments. The piglets with diarrhea were randomly divided into two groups. Five mL normal saline which contained BBA 1.36 grams was given to piglets from BBA treated group by intragastric administration for 3 days, twice a day, continuously. BBA untreated group was administered with 5 mL normal saline as the control group. The stools from three piglets (sample named erqian, sanqian, siqian) untreated with BBA were collected, and the stools from the same three piglets (sample named erhou, sanhou, sihou) treated with BBA were collected at 3 day for metagenomic sequencing.

DNA purification from stool was carried out according to the protocols [55]. In brief, the stools from the piglets were collected in storage tubes and then stored in liquid nitrogen until DNA extraction. The genomic DNA was extracted from stools by using the QiagenQIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) for DNA sequence analysis (DNA-Seq) in the Shanghai Biochip Corporation (Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration and molecular weight of the genomic DNA were determined by utilizing the nanodrop instrument (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively.

DNA library construction was carried out by using the NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The library quality was detected utilizing Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The paired-end metagenomic sequencing (2 × 150 base pair) was determined in the Illumina platform.

The sequencing reads were quality performed and assembled de novo in contigs by utilizing metaSPAdes (SPAdes-3.10.1) [56]. Gene prediction with the default parameters was carried out by using MetaGeneMark (GeneMark.hmm version 3.38) [57]. Redundant genes were deleted by utilizing Blastn software with the cutoff of 90% length and 95% identity [58]. Relative abundances of the genes were performed by aligning high-quality sequencing reads to the gene catalog [59]. The putative amino acid sequences were aligned against the proteins/domains within evolutionary genealogy of genes: Non-supervised Orthologous Groups (eggNOG) (v4.5) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases (release 59.0) by utilizing diamond (e-value ≤ 1 × 10−5) [60]. To determine the abundances of eggNOG or KEGG orthologue groups, the abundances of proteins were added which were assigned into the same eggNOG or KEGG orthologue groups. The quality-controlled reads were carried out using MetaPhlAn2 to obtain the taxonomic profile of the microbial community [61].

eggNOGs were characterized by determining their enrichment analysis using the Gene Ontology (GO) classification. The biological pathways involved in eggNOGs were analyzed using Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), version 6.7. GO and pathway enrichment analysis were determined using DAVID. UniFrac-based principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was detected by QIIME (V1.8.0) [62]. Principal components analysis (PCA) was determined using R (3.0.2) [63]. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) software was used to identify the differences of representative species, Kos, and eggNOGs between two or more groups of the samples under different conditions [64].

The experimental data were presented as mean ± SD. The difference between two groups was analyzed using the two-tailed Student t-test. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. * p < 0.05.

Our data showed that BBA could significantly reduce the diarrhea rates among piglets, and modulate the composition, phylotypes, and genes expression of gut microbiomes. Our results may provide new potential anti-microbiological mechanisms of BBA and a novel therapy target to control diarrhea of piglets.
