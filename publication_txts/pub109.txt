MICHELINdb: a web-based tool for mining of helminth-microbiota interaction datasets, and a meta-analysis of current research

The complex network of interactions occurring between gastrointestinal (GI) and extra-intestinal (EI) parasitic helminths of humans and animals and the resident gut microbial flora is attracting increasing attention from biomedical researchers, because of the likely implications for the pathophysiology of helminth infection and disease. Nevertheless, the vast heterogeneity of study designs and microbial community profiling strategies, and of bioinformatic and biostatistical approaches for analyses of metagenomic sequence datasets hinder the identification of bacterial targets for follow-up experimental investigations of helminth-microbiota cross-talk. Furthermore, comparative analyses of published datasets are made difficult by the unavailability of a unique repository for metagenomic sequence data and associated metadata linked to studies aimed to explore potential changes in the composition of the vertebrate gut microbiota in response to GI and/or EI helminth infections.

Here, we undertake a meta-analysis of available metagenomic sequence data linked to published studies on helminth-microbiota cross-talk in humans and veterinary species using a single bioinformatic pipeline, and introduce the 'MICrobiome HELminth INteractions database' (MICHELINdb), an online resource for mining of published sequence datasets, and corresponding metadata, generated in these investigations.

By increasing data accessibility, we aim to provide the scientific community with a platform to identify gut microbial populations with potential roles in the pathophysiology of helminth disease and parasite-mediated suppression of host inflammatory responses, and facilitate the design of experiments aimed to disentangle the cause(s) and effect(s) of helminth-microbiota relationships.

In the world, > 1.5 billion people are infected with parasitic helminths (worms), including the gastrointestinal (GI) roundworms Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale and the extra-intestinal (EI) blood flukes Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum and S. haematobium [1–3]. In endemic areas of Africa, South America and South-East Asia characterised by poor sanitation and sub-optimal hygiene standards, these parasites are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women [4, 5]. Furthermore, GI and EI parasites of livestock are responsible for substantial economic losses worldwide, due to impaired production, growth retardation, treatment costs and/or stock replacement [6]. Currently, control of parasitic helminths relies heavily on the administration of anthelmintics via mass drug administration and targeted strategic treatment programmes in humans [7, 8] and veterinary species [9, 10], respectively. However, drug resistance to all available classes of anthelmintics is widespread in helminths of livestock [9, 10] and the threat of emerging anthelmintic resistance in human parasites is concrete [11]. In addition, even after successful elimination of worms, both humans and animals remain at-risk of re-infections, which often occur rapidly in endemic areas [12, 13]. Thus, the discovery and development of alternative strategies of helminth control has long been a major focus of the global ‘One Health’ agenda [14–16]. A thorough understanding of the fundamental biology of helminth parasites and of host-pathogen interactions may assist the search for new drug targets.

In this study, we undertake a meta-analysis of high-throughput amplicon 16S rRNA sequence datasets linked to studies of helminth-microbiota interactions in humans and veterinary species, using consistent data reprocessing; in addition, in order to facilitate the retrieval of information generated in published investigations conducted in different host-parasite pairs, under varying conditions of helminth infection (i.e. natural vs. experimental and acute vs. chronic), and analysing different biological specimens (i.e. faeces vs. host GI tissue samples), we created the 'MICrobiome HELminth INteractions database' (MICHELINdb; www.michelindb.com). In this database, information generated from individual studies of helminth-microbiota interactions are stored together with associated metadata on host and parasite species, infection site, sample type and metagenomic sequencing strategy (amongst others), and links to raw sequence data and published papers. By increasing the accessibility of these datasets and by presenting the results of a meta-analysis of available data using a single bioinformatic pipeline, we aim to provide the scientific community with a platform to identify gut microbial signatures that occur across several host-helminth systems, and facilitate the design of experiments aimed to disentangle the cause(s) and effect(s) of helminth-microbiota relationships.

Published studies on the composition of the gut microbiota of vertebrate hosts acutely and/or chronically infected by parasitic helminths (nematodes, cestodes and trematodes) were retrieved by mining search engines (i.e. NCBI PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect) using the terms ‘gut’ AND/OR ‘microbiome’ AND/OR ‘microbiota’ AND/OR ‘parasite’ AND/OR ‘helminth’ and by following references in published reviews and related studies. All sequence datasets retrieved using this method, as well as associated metadata, were included in MICHELINdb, together with study findings (see below), whilst only studies that satisfied the following criteria were included in the meta-analysis:

Sequence datasets linked to studies that required additional ethics committee approval or institutional authorization for data access were not included in the meta-analysis; however, these datasets and corresponding findings, as presented in the original publications, are available for mining in MICHELINdb. For studies investigating the impact of anthelmintic administration on host gut microbiota composition, only sequence data obtained from biological specimens collected from helminth-infected and -uninfected human or animal controls were included in the meta-analysis; nevertheless, any available information on observed differences in microbial composition between specimens collected prior to and following anthelmintic treatment (as per original publication) is included in MICHELINdb. Biological specimens collected from the ileum and duodenum of vertebrate hosts were classified as originating from the small intestine. A summary of the publication selection strategy adopted in our meta-analysis is available from Fig.
1.

Raw sequence data representing the hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and linked to the studies outlined above were obtained from public sequence data repositories using accession numbers provided in the corresponding publications or following direct email communication with the corresponding authors (Table
1). When needed, provided barcodes were matched to sequences for demultiplexing. Then, sequence data were (re)processed (individually for each study) using the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) MGnify service pipeline, that integrates MAPseq v 1.2 [32] for operational taxonomic unit (OTU) assignment and SILVA (https://www.arb-silva.de/) [37] as the reference database for taxonomic classification. For details on the full properties of the MGnify pipeline, its performance compared to other open source software for high-throughput 16S rRNA sequence data analysis, as well as on its validation for metagenomic studies, we refer to the original publication by Mitchell et al. [50]. For each study included in the meta-analysis, OTU assignments are available from EBI MGnify (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/), under the corresponding MGnify/ENA accession reported in Table
1. For downstream analyses, samples containing < 100 reads were removed and OTU and taxonomy tables from each sample were merged using the feature-table merge command in QIIME 2 [33]. OTUs represented by < 10 reads and/or making up < 2% of the total number of OTUs identified in a given sample, as well as OTUs assigned to chloroplast taxa, were removed prior to statistical analyses.

All statistical analyses were executed using both the Calypso software (cgenome.net/calypso/) [51] and a custom-made code in R statistical software version 3.5.2, packages ‘phyloseq’, ‘vegan’, ‘meta’, ‘metaphor’ and ‘ggplot2’.

The interpolated area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (= AUC) was used to identify bacterial taxa associated with host infection status. Briefly, ‘infection status’ and ‘microbial relative abundance’ were used as explanatory variables and outcome, respectively, in a random forest (RF) statistical classifier. A predicted mean decreasing accuracy (MDA) score was then generated for each taxon, at phylum and genus level, using the estimated RF model; subsequently, taxa were classified using AUC > 0.5 as cut-off. In comparative analyses between gut microbial profiles of helminth-infected and -uninfected hosts, only phyla making up > 1% of the overall microbiota, and genera > 0.5% in at least one group were considered (Table
2).

MICHELINdb was constructed as a relational database application to facilitate mining of information linked to available bacterial 16S rRNA sequence datasets generated in published studies aimed to uncover associations between GI and EI helminth infections and host gut microbiota composition. MICHELINdb was implemented using the MSSQL Express software (https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express), accessed via an N-Tier architecture (written in C# and ASP.NET MVC) on which the database (http://www.michelindb.com) resides.

Literature database searches using the keywords listed above yielded 54 unique studies, published between 2010 and 2019, on the interactions between GI and EI helminth parasites and the gut microbiota of their vertebrate hosts (Additional file 1: Table S1). Of these, 15 matched the criteria outlined above and were retained in our meta-analysis (Table
1). These studies spanned ten helminth species, including nematodes (e.g. N. americanus and Haemonchus contortus) and trematodes (e.g. Opisthorchis viverrini and S. mansoni), of both public health and veterinary significance, and seven vertebrate hosts (i.e. human, cat, dog, goat, hamster, mouse and wild-mouse); of 15 studies included in our meta-analysis, 14 targeted the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Table
1). Sequence data from a total of 732 biological specimens (i.e. faecal or tissue samples) were included in the meta-analysis, of which 413 were annotated as originating from helminth-infected hosts, and 319 from matching uninfected controls (Table
1 and Additional file 2: Table S2). A total of 80,924,051 paired-end reads were collected and subjected to (re)processing, of which 41,562,339 and 39,361,712 represented sequences generated from helminth-infected and -uninfected biological specimens, respectively (Table
1 and Additional file 2: Table S2). Following trimming and quality filtering, a total of 74,676,551 high-quality reads (i.e. 38,365,608 and 36,310,943 generated from helminth-infected and -uninfected specimens, respectively) were retained for downstream analyses (Table
1 and Additional file 2: Table S2).

In order to assess the variability of the microbial community profiles included in our meta-analysis, individual sequence datasets generated from helminth-infected and -uninfected specimens were clustered at OTU level using PCoA, based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix and with ‘host’ as explanatory variable (Fig.
2). The two axes accounted for 44% of the total variance, i.e. 24% and 20% for PCoA1 and PCoA2, respectively (Fig.
2). In particular, the microbial profiles of specimens from humans, cats, dogs and goats clustered closely together, with minimal overlap with those from hamsters, mice and wild-mice (that were spread across the two variables) (Fig.
2). Therefore, given the largely distinct gut microbial profiles that characterised these two host groups, downstream analyses were conducted by categorising microbial profiles into ‘Non-rodents’ (i.e. human, cat, dog and goat, n = 339; helminth-uninfected n = 140 vs. -infected n = 199) and ‘Rodents’ (i.e. mouse, hamster and wild yellow-necked mouse, n = 393; helminth-uninfected n = 179 vs. infected n = 214) (cf. Fig.
3a, b). PCoA analyses conducted separately for each of the Non-rodent and Rodent microbial profiles revealed clustering according to specimen type (i.e. faeces or intestinal tissue) for the former, and according to collection site (i.e. stomach and small intestine, and large intestine and faeces) for the latter (cf. Additional file 1: Figure S1a and S1b). The microbial community profiles of both Non-rodents and Rodents were also segregated by hierarchical clustering and ordinated by supervised CCA, which revealed a significant association between microbiota composition and infection status (i.e. helminth-uninfected vs. -infected) for both Non-rodents (p = 0.007) and Rodents (p = 0.001) (Fig.
3c, d).

For the Non-rodents, no significant differences in gut microbial alpha diversity were observed between helminth-infected and -uninfected hosts (standardized diversity difference [SMD] = − 0.02; standard deviation 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = [− 0.33; 0.28], random effects model pooled p = 0.30; Fig.
4a). For the Rodents, infection by parasitic helminths was associated with a decreased gut microbial alpha diversity (standardized Shannon index) when compared to the uninfected counterparts (standardized diversity difference [SMD] = − 0.23; standard deviation 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = [− 1.24; 0.77], random effects model pooled p < 0.01; Fig.
4c).

At genus level, 14 taxa (> 1% relative abundance) were identified in the gut microbiota of Non-rodents, with Bacteroides being predominant (i.e. 7% relative abundance in helminth-uninfected vs. 4% in -infected samples) (Fig.
5c). Seven bacterial genera were identified in the gut microbiota of Rodents, with the genus Lactobacillus making up 15% and 33% of the whole bacterial communities of helminth-uninfected and infected hosts, respectively (Fig.
5d). At genus level, Bacteroides discriminated between the gut microbiota of helminth-uninfected and -infected specimens in the Non-rodents (MDA = 0.60; Table
2), whereas the genera Turicibacter and Lactobacillus were significantly reduced and expanded in helminth-uninfected and -infected samples, respectively, from the Rodents (Table
2).

A total of 54 published studies, spanning 33 parasites species and 14 vertebrate hosts, are currently stored in MICHELINdb (latest update October 2019). Each publication is assigned a unique ‘Mdb ID’ and an individual webpage including key study features (e.g. host and parasite species), sample metadata, microbiota profiling method, a summary of salient findings (as reported in the original publication) and details of microbial diversity indexes, as well as of specific taxonomic assignments of bacterial 16S rRNA sequences positively or negatively associated to helminth infection in the original publication (ranked according to phylum, order, class, family, genus and species). Links to the corresponding published article and to public sequence repositories hosting raw datafiles, as well as information on Open Access availability are also provided (see, for example, http://www.michelindb.com/a/d/c2f19866-eaf5-4b19-a7d5-95247f60f183).

MICHELINdb is searchable and browsable by several categories, including host and parasite species, microbiota profiling method and taxonomic classification of bacterial organisms with putative role(s) in helminth-microbiota interactions (according to available literature) by means of drop-down menus located at http://www.michelindb.com/a/as. In addition, metadata from individual studies can be exported by the user in .xml format. MICHELINdb will be subjected to regular updates (every 6 months) to ensure inclusion of new data and corresponding metadata from published investigations of helminth-microbiota relationships that were unavailable at the time of manuscript submission and peer-review, as well as post-website launch.

As a first step towards the identification of gut microbial taxa with potential roles in host-parasite crosstalk, we conducted a meta-analysis of 15 bacterial 16S rRNA sequence datasets obtained from seven host and ten parasite species, respectively, using a single bioinformatic pipeline. Such an approach allowed us to detect differences between the microbial profiles of rodent hosts (mainly laboratory models of helminth infections) and non-rodents (spanning experimentally and naturally helminth-infected humans and animals), which were therefore considered separately in downstream bioinformatic and biostatistical analyses of sequence data. The gut of rodent hosts has been reported to harbour a significantly different microbiome to that of humans and other mammalians [52, 53], which might explain the dissimilarities between the microbial profiles of these two groups observed in our meta-analysis. This observation calls for caution when translating findings obtained from mouse models of helminth infections to humans, and provide further support to the need of identifying common microbiota traits between laboratory rodents and ‘natural’ helminth hosts.

Whilst this discussion focused on gut bacterial taxa whose relative abundances were repeatedly reported to be affected by helminth infections, several other bacterial groups that are seemingly unaffected by helminth colonisation may play yet undiscovered roles in host-parasite interactions. The application of shotgun metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic technologies to studies of the vertebrate gut microbiome in response to helminth infections may assist further investigations in this area; for instance, large-scale characterisations of gut bacterial gene expression prior to and following helminth colonisation could reveal key aspects of parasite-microbiota crosstalk that may not be reflected by significant changes in the relative abundances of individual microbial taxa post-helminth establishment.

The (re)analysis of microbial 16S rRNA sequence data generated from a range of helminth-infected and -uninfected hosts and biological samples using a single bioinformatic pipeline allowed us to identify ‘common signatures’ characterising the microbial profiles of parasite-colonised hosts that may be targeted in future studies aimed at discovering and developing novel strategies of parasite treatment and control via the manipulation of resident populations of gut bacteria. Furthermore, we constructed MICHELINdb, a publicly available database including bacterial sequence data and sample metadata from published studies comparing the gut microbiota composition of several host species infected by one or multiple GI and/or EI helminth parasites with that of corresponding uninfected hosts. MICHELINdb allows easy data access, and enables time-efficient comparisons of quantitative and qualitative alterations in gut microbial composition upon GI and EI helminth infections detected in studies conducted in a range of host-parasite systems and using different experimental protocols and microbiota profiling techniques. Data and metadata linked to studies stored in MICHELINdb can be readily exported, to allow users to collect and store information, undertake further analyses and expand the meta-analysis dataset. Users are encouraged to submit newly generated data and metadata to MICHELINdb using the link provided, in order to enhance the exhaustiveness of the database and facilitate meaningful biological interpretations of study findings.
