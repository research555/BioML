Interaction between drugs and the gut microbiome

The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem that can mediate the interaction of the human host with their environment. The interaction between gut microbes and commonly used non-antibiotic drugs is complex and bidirectional: gut microbiome composition can be influenced by drugs, but, vice versa, the gut microbiome can also influence an individual’s response to a drug by enzymatically transforming the drug’s structure and altering its bioavailability, bioactivity or toxicity (pharmacomicrobiomics). The gut microbiome can also indirectly impact an individual’s response to immunotherapy in cancer treatment. In this review we discuss the bidirectional interactions between microbes and drugs, describe the changes in gut microbiota induced by commonly used non-antibiotic drugs, and their potential clinical consequences and summarise how the microbiome impacts drug effectiveness and its role in immunotherapy. Understanding how the microbiome metabolises drugs and reduces treatment efficacy will unlock the possibility of modulating the gut microbiome to improve treatment.

In the past decade we have witnessed exciting discoveries linking the composition and function of the human gut microbiome to numerous common diseases and phenotypes. Association studies have documented changes in the abundance of various gut bacteria in individuals with gastrointestinal phenotypes, including inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome and colorectal cancer, and with diseases of other systems and organs, including cardiovascular and metabolic conditions, autoimmune conditions and psychiatric disorders.1–9 In addition to association analyses, intervention studies and animal studies have proven not only the association but also the causality of the gut microbiome in relation to several diseases.10 Moreover, the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on gut microbiome composition is increasingly being understood.

One very important recent finding is that many commonly used non-antibiotic drugs—such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and metformin—change microbiome composition and function.11 12 These changes can influence health outcomes (in the case of PPIs) or reduce drug efficacy (in the case of metformin). At the same time, more data has become available showing that the gut microbiome can directly influence an individual’s response to a specific drug by enzymatically transforming the drug’s structure and altering its bioavailability, bioactivity or toxicity—a phenomenon now referred to as pharmacomicrobiomics (figure 1). Finally, the gut microbiome can indirectly impact an individual’s response to immunotherapy in cancer treatment via its influence on the host’s general immune status.13 These exciting new insights into the bidirectional interaction between non-antibiotic drugs and the gut microbiome are the focus of the current review.

Just a few decades ago our ability to analyse the role of the gut microbiome in relation to human health was mainly defined by large technical challenges. Historically, microbiome studies were performed using culturing methods in which one, or a few, bacterial species were isolated and studied in relation to a disease. This research produced numerous important findings, but our ability to analyse other components of the gut ecosystem was limited. The development of the technique to sequence the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene allowed overall taxonomic assessment of the gut microbiome, and this has dramatically increased our knowledge of the broad variations in microbial composition. More recently, whole genome shotgun sequencing, or metagenomic sequencing (MGS), has become a powerful methodology for studying the microbiome. MGS allows identification of not only bacteria, but also viruses, protozoa and fungi, and it enables focussed analysis of bacterial genes and predicted biological pathways. However, as with all sequencing-based methods, MGS results are very dependent on the method used to isolate DNA from stool samples, and this is the major source of the technical variability in the results of microbiome studies.14 Other omics approaches, such as metatranscriptomics, metametabolomics and metaproteomics, are also increasingly being used to get a comprehensive picture of the gut ecosystem. Finally, culturomics analysis, which allows deep characterisation of individual associated species and strains, is again becoming an important method to understand the role of specific taxa in relation to diseases.

With the aid of next-generating sequencing, gut microbiome analysis has been applied to several human cohorts. One important finding is the large interindividual variability of the gut ecosystem: only a minority of gut microbes are shared across the majority of individuals. For example, in a European data set of 3000 samples, only 17 bacteria were identified as a core microbiome present in >95% of all samples.15 The majority of bacteria are rare. Of the 639 species identified in a population study of 1135 Dutch individuals, 469 (73%) were present in fewer than 10 individuals.16 This high interindividual variability potentially leads to variations in the metabolic functions carried out by the gut microbiome.

Human cohort-based analysis has further shown that the dynamic nature of the gut ecosystem reflects a complex interaction of the host with lifestyle, dietary, ecological and other factors. Hundreds of intrinsic and environmental factors influence the gut microbiome in healthy individuals, including diet, medication, smoking, lifestyle, host genetics and diseases.15 17 Among all environmental factors, commonly used drugs play a particularly important role in the gut ecosystem.

Several human cohort studies have reported associations between use of specific drugs and altered microbial composition and functional profiles (summarised in table 1). One of the first studies to see this was conducted in the Dutch LifeLines-DEEP cohort, and this study reported microbial associations to 19 out of 42 commonly used drugs.17 In addition to antibiotics, many human-targeted non-antibiotic drugs were associated with changes in microbial composition. The top microbiome-associated drugs included PPIs, lipid-lowering statins, laxatives, metformin, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, and similar associations were also observed in a Belgium Flemish cohort15 and in the TwinsUK cohort18 (table 1). It is also worth noting that these drug-microbe associations were mostly assessed for individual drugs. However, we know that patients often take multiple drugs, and this co-medication may be a source of bias when assessing drug-microbe associations. A more recent study further assessed the impact of polypharmacy and comorbidities on the gut microbiome.19 This study took a more in-depth look by performing a meta-analysis of the associations between drug use and the gut microbiome in three independent cohorts, including patients with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, and found 19 of the 41 medication categories studied to be associated with the gut microbiome. As many of the study participants used multiple drugs, a stepwise approach was used to regress out the effect of polypharmacy. After statistically correcting for polypharmacy, PPIs, metformin, antibiotics and laxatives still showed significant associations with microbial features.19

Data extracted from four population studies in three populations: Dutch: (1) Vich Vila et al, Nat.Communications, 2019,19 and (2) Zhernakova et al, Science, 2016;16 UK: (3) Jackson et al, Nat. Communications, 201818 and Belgium: (4) Falony et al, Science, 2016.15 The table includes drugs used by >2.5% of population in either a Dutch (1) or UK (3) study that showed association to the gut microbiome diversity, composition or taxa. As both Dutch studies (1 and 2) have largely overlapping samples, we only present the taxonomic association results from Vich Vila, which were generated using the more recent MetaPhlAn pipeline and included association on all taxonomic levels.

Despite the high consistency of drug-microbe associations detected in multiple human cohorts, differences in the estimated effect sizes reflect differences in drug usage in different European countries and in different patients. For instance, the observed impact of antibiotic use on microbial composition in the Belgium Flemish cohort was higher than that in the Dutch LifeLines-DEEP cohort, which is line with the fact that the prescription rate of antibiotics is higher in Belgium than in the Netherlands. Age and gender differences between cohorts also have a strong effect on the frequency of drug usage, and therefore on the observed results.

PPIs are among the most commonly used drugs worldwide and are used to treat acid-related disorders such as peptic ulcers, gastro-oesophageal reflux and dyspepsia and for prevention of non-steroidalanti-inflammatory drug-induced gastroduodenopathy and bleeding. Since PPIs are very effective and have a very favourable safety profile, their use has increased very rapidly over the past few decades. In the Netherlands, two million individuals (~12% of the population) now use either pantoprazole or omeprazole by prescription, and similar usage percentages have been reported for other countries such as the UK.20 21 The total cost of PPIs in the UK is estimated to be more than £100 million per year.22 Moreover, as PPIs are available over-the-counter in the Netherlands, and in many other countries, the total number of PPI users will be much higher than the estimate based on prescriptions alone. In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to the safety profile and potential side effects of chronic use of PPIs. Although the relative risk of adverse drug response (ADR) is low, the high worldwide number of PPI users means that absolute numbers of patients with an ADR can still be high. While there are clear evidence-based indications for the use of PPIs, it has been suggested that up to 70% of PPI prescriptions may be unnecessary,22 with use of PPIs as prophylaxis for stress ulcers in patients who do not meet evidence-based prescription criteria a major contributor to this. Another important factor here is that once PPIs are started there is little re-assessment of the original indication for which the PPI was prescribed, and subsequent attempts to stop them lead to unnecessary chronic use.23 24

While the efficacy and safety profiles of PPIs are still very favourable when they are prescribed for evidence-based indications, the medical community should start to rethink their widespread and chronic use and their over-the-counter availability. We have come to the point where we need to carefully assess the long-term effects of PPI-induced changes in the microbiome in up to one-fifth of the population in western society, a shift that has taken place in a relative short period of time in human history, and specifically examine the effects of changing the developing gut microbiome in early life and its influence on health and disease in later life.

Metformin is an oral blood glucose-lowering compound used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). While its exact working mechanism is complex, and not fully understood, metformin does inhibit liver gluconeogenesis, and studies increasingly suggest that some of its beneficial effects are mediated by the gut microbiota.34 35 Compared with PPIs, which are used for a wide number of indications or symptoms, metformin is (almost) exclusively used in the setting of diabetes, making it harder to disentangle the effect of the drug on the microbiome from changes in the gut microbiome that are related to the underlying disease. However, this has been done by a landmark study, which showed that previously observed changes in the gut microbiome thought to be driven by the underlying T2D were actually caused by the use of metformin.12

The intertwined relationship between metformin and the gut microbiome shows how a commonly used drug can change the gut microbiome and explain part of the drug’s therapeutic function, as well as some of its side effects. It also emphasises the need to rigorously control for confounders like drug use (including of metformin, antibiotics, PPIs and other drugs) when performing microbiome studies looking at specific diseases or conditions.

Large population-based microbiome studies using cross-sectional data from cohorts from the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium have assessed hundreds of factors, including drug use. In addition to PPIs and metformin, these studies have shown that other commonly used drugs, including laxatives, statins, antidepressants and opioids, can explain some of the variability in gut microbiome composition.15 18 37

When considering microbial changes induced by the use of laxatives, one should take into account the fact that intestinal transit time, stool consistency and bacterial quantities (eg, microbial load per sample) all influence microbiome features.38 39 For example, increased abundances of Bacteroides species are observed in individuals taking laxatives, but also in low consistency stool samples. However, in an independent study of mice exposed to polyethylene glycol (PEG) showed a similar increase in Bacteroides. In this study, the induction of mild osmotic diarrhoea by administration of PEG induced long-term changes in the gut microbiome, transient disruption of the mucus barrier and subsequent innate and adaptive immune responses.40 After PEG administration, the S24-7 Family (within the order Bacteroidales) disappeared and was replaced entirely by outgrowth of the family Bacteroidaceae. This effect was permanent unless the S24-7 Family was replaced. Other taxa, like Verrucomicrobia and Gammaproteobacteria, showed transient changes, but eventually returned to their initial levels. Scarce human data in patients taking bowel preparations have also shown short-term transient changes in microbiome diversity metrics, but detailed studies are lacking.41 However, given the findings in mice, it is likely that the use of laxatives has both short-term and long-term effects on gut microbiome composition that are independent of stool consistency and bacterial quantities per sample.

Over the past few decades, pharmacogenomics has become a well-established field that studies how human genome variations affect drug disposition and action. With the increasing recognition of the gut microbiome as the second human genome, the concept of pharmacomicrobiomics has been introduced as a natural expansion of pharmacogenomics. While this field is attracting new attention, the idea that the gut microbiome can impact drug efficacy can be dated back to 1937 and the discovery of the impact of gut microbes on the activation of the antibacterial drug prontosil.42 43 Orally administered drugs pass through the upper gastrointestinal track and continue into the intestinal tract, where they encounter the thousands of different species residing in our gut (figure 1). The consequent interactions are bidirectional. On the one hand, drugs can change intestinal microenvironments and affect bacterial growth, composition and function, as described above. On the other, the gut microbiome can directly influence an individual’s response to a specific drug by enzymatically transforming drug structure and thereby altering its bioavailability, bioactivity or toxicity.44 Unlike human genetics, the gut microbiome is modifiable, making it an attractive therapeutic target to optimise therapy.

In parallel with the gut-microbe associations observed in humans, several in vitro and animal studies have revealed the action modes of drug-microbe interactions and the potential consequences for drug efficacy and safety.

Drug usage may influence gut microbial compositions in different ways, and at least two action modes have been proposed. The first mode is that drugs can result in the translocation of the microbiome from other body sites to the gut. As described above, PPIs can reduce the acidity barrier of the stomach, which allows oral microbes pass through the stomach to the gut, thereby inducing microbial dysbiosis. The second action mode, which might be the dominant one, is that drugs can change intestinal microenvironments and directly affect bacterial growth. For instance, metformin has been found to promote the growth of short-chain fatty acid producers in the gut, with these bacteria ultimately contributing to the therapeutic effect of metformin in improving insulin resistance and glucose homoeostasis. This second action mode can be bidirectional. Instead of promoting growth of certain bacteria, drugs can also inhibit the growth of specific bacteria, for example, showing antimicrobial activities as antibiotics. This was demonstrated by a landmark high-throughput study27 in which the authors systematically assessed the antimicrobial effects of over 1000 drugs, including 835 human-targeted drugs that act by targeting human cells. Notably, 24% of these drugs showed antibacterial activity, affecting the growth rate of at least one of the 40 bacterial strains under study. Among them, eight drugs seemed to be toxic to bacteria, affecting the growth rate of at least 50% of the strains. These drugs included four antineoplastic agents (daunorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, streptozotocin and floxuridine), two anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic drugs (auranofin and diacerein), one antigout drug (benzbromarone) and one drug for peptic ulcer disease (oxethazaine). This result strongly highlights the side effects of cancer therapy on the gut microbiome, as these drugs are often cytotoxic.

It has been shown that gut microbes can contribute to drug efficacy and safety by enzymatically transforming drug structure and altering drug bioavailability, bioactivity or toxicity. For instance, the oral antiviral drug brivudine can be metabolised to bromovinyluracil by both the host and the gut microbiota, with the latter exerting hepatic toxicity. By comparing the plasma and liver concentrations of brivudine and bromovinyluracil between conventional and germ-free mice, Zimmermann et al determined that 70% of brivudine toxicity is attributable to gut microbes, particularly to Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides ovatus.45 The same research group further conducted a systematic analysis to test the metabolic capacity of 76 gut microbial strains on 271 orally administered drugs46 and found that 176 drugs (66%) were metabolised by a least one kind of bacterial stain. The drugs that were metabolised by most microbes in vitro included PPIs (pantoprazole, omeprazole and tenatoprazole), the chemotherapeutic drug melphalan, the antimalarial artemisinin and the Parkinson’s drug mesylate. These could be metabolised by almost all the bacterial strains under study. The super drug-metabolising strains were Bacteroides dorei (strain DSM17855) and Clostridium sp, which could metabolise 164 and 154 drugs, respectively.

All in all, the results of these two independent studies, one assessing the antimicrobial effect of drugs27 and one assessing bacterial ability to metabolising the drugs,46 show that sustainable drugs that can function under bacterial metabolism but do not show strong antimicrobial effect (figure 2). However, bidirectional effects are pronounced for several drugs, for example, levodopa.

Levodopa, used for the treatment of Parkinson disease, is an intriguing example of microbial impact on drug efficacy. After oral administration, levodopa needs to be absorbed via the small intestine so it can cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain, where the human enzyme aromatic amino acid decarboxylase converts levodopa to the therapeutically active dopamine. The bioavailability of levodopa to the brain is a key factor for drug efficacy, and levodopa is often co-administered with catechol metabolism inhibitors, for example, carbidopa and entacapone, to inhibit its off-site metabolism. In recent years, research has shown that the microbial decarboxylases that are part of gut microbial organisms appear to be able to metabolise levodopa. Novel bacterial L-dopa metabolism by tyrosine decarboxylases (tyrDCs) has been identified, dominantly driven by Enterococcus faecalis.47 Conversely, mutating these tyrDCs in E. faecalis can block this bacterial L-dopa-to-dopamine metabolism, thereby improving drug efficacy. In addition to Enterococcus species, tyrDCs are also present in Lactobacillus species, although Enterococcus and Lactobacillus species show considerable differences in the efficiency of their L-dopa metabolism.48 Moreover, gut bacterial metabolism of L-dopa not only decreases drug availability, it also induces ADRs. Eggerthella lenta and 10 other bacterial species were found to contain the dopamine-dehydroxylating enzyme, which can further convert bacterial-derived dopamine to m-tyramine and thereby induce hypertensive crisis.47

Interestingly, in vitro, there is also a direct metabolising effect of bacteria on the catechol metabolism inhibitors carbidopa and entacapone that are often co-administered with levodopa. Numerous microbes can metabolise entacapone. E. faecalis, for instance, metabolises both levodopa and entacapone at an efficiency of 98.9%.46 Conversely, entacapone can also inhibit the growth rate of 10 different species,27 including Ruminococcus torques, which in turn metabolises entacapone at 84% efficiency.46 These results show the complicated bidirectional interaction between drugs and gut microbes.

We have described how commonly used non-antibiotic drugs can influence the gut microbiome composition and how the gut microbiome composition can influence drug availability and efficacy. In addition, there is also increasing evidence that the gut microbiome is involved in modulating the clinical response to cancer therapy. This occurs specifically in the setting of treatment with immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies that target programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) or the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4).49 50 Here the postulated mechanism of action lies in the role of the gut microbiome in fine-tuning the general host immune status and subsequently in antitumour activation of the immune system on checkpoint inhibition (figure 3).

Recognition that the microbiome plays a role in antitumour efficacy is a major scientific breakthrough that has changed our thinking on how to predict and improve cancer immunotherapy. Understanding the underlying mechanisms will be crucial, and results of interventional trials will aid in optimising immunotherapy treatment.

We have described the complex bidirectional interaction between commonly used non-antibiotic drugs and the gut microbiome and described different examples to highlight specific mechanisms. Clinicians need to be aware that it is not only antibiotics that influence the gut microbiome, non-antibiotic drugs can also change the gut microbiome and ultimately lead to impaired health outcomes. At the same time, the pharmacomicrobiomics field is emerging, and a deeper understanding of how the microbiome metabolises drugs or ameliorates the efficacy of, for example, anticancer treatment, will open up the possibility of modulating the gut microbiome to improve treatment efficacy. Clinical trials are already underway, and their results will influence clinical practice in the foreseeable future.
