The Fungal Gut Microbiome Exhibits Reduced Diversity and Increased Relative Abundance of Ascomycota in Severe COVID-19 Illness and Distinct Interconnected Communities in SARS-CoV-2 Positive Patients



Clinical and experimental studies indicate that the bacterial and fungal gut microbiota modulates immune responses in distant organs including the lungs. Immune dysregulation is associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and several groups have observed gut bacterial dysbiosis in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, while the fungal gut microbiota remains poorly defined in these patients. We analyzed the fungal gut microbiome from rectal swabs taken prior to anti-infective treatment in 30 SARS-CoV-2 positive (21 non-severe COVID-19 and 9 developing severe/critical COVID-19 patients) and 23 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients by ITS2-sequencing. Pronounced but distinct interconnected fungal communities distinguished SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. Fungal gut microbiota in severe/critical COVID-19 illness was characterized by a reduced diversity, richness and evenness and by an increase of the relative abundance of the Ascomycota phylum compared with non-severe COVID-19 illness. A dominance of a single fungal species with a relative abundance of >75% was a frequent feature in severe/critical COVID-19. The dominating fungal species were highly variable between patients even within the groups. Several fungal taxa were depleted in patients with severe/critical COVID-19.The distinct compositional changes of the fungal gut microbiome in SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in severe COVID-19 illness, illuminate the necessity of a broader approach to investigate whether the differences in the fungal gut microbiome are consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a predisposing factor for critical illness.

The gut microbiome is a major player in immunomodulation and immune response both locally and in distant tissues (Rhee et al., 2009; Szabo, 2015; Scheffold and Bacher, 2020), up to fecal transplants determining the survival of influenza-infected mice (Zhang et al., 2020). Metabolites like butyrate are heavily implicated in immunomodulation (Chriett et al., 2019), circulate systemically (Ritzhaupt et al., 1998) and influence the severity of lung infections (Haak et al., 2018; Chemudupati et al., 2020).

Our study aims to characterize the composition of the fungal microbiome linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity in a cohort of 53 patients in order to assess the impact of fungal dysbiosis in the context of this pandemic. We found major differences in alpha and beta diversity in fungal blooms between mild and severe cases of COVID-19 and distinct differences in the interconnected fungal communities between SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients, raising the question of the role of the fungal microbiome in shaping the course of COVID-19.

The Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Duisburg-Essen reviewed and approved this study (20-9237-BO) which was performed in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before enrolment. All samples included in this study were part of a cohort of 212 patients presenting in the tertiary care University Hospital Essen between April and November 2020 that comprised 117 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 95 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with other reasons for hospital presentation described elsewhere (Reinold et al., 2021). SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs was used for detection of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in all patients enrolled in this study. Pneumonia was diagnosed by low-dose computer tomography or chest x-ray. COVID-19 severity illness was classified according to the WHO (Agarwal et al., 2020). Non-severe COVID-19 was defined as SARS-CoV-2 infection without pneumonia or pneumonia with a saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) > 90% on room air and typical signs such as fever and cough. Severe COVID-19 was defined as symptomatic pneumonia with SpO2 < 90% on room air and a respiratory rate > 30 breaths per minute or clinical signs of severe dyspnoea. Critical disease was classified by the need of life-sustaining treatment, e.g. acute respiratory distress syndrome or septic shock. Severe and critical COVID-19 patients were assigned to one category (severe/critical) because of the low number of patients with critical COVID-19. Initially, the ITS2 region was amplified in all rectal swab samples of the 212 patient samples of the larger cohort. Only the 53 patients who exhibited visible ITS2-region amplicons in agarose gel electrophoresis after 32 rounds of PCR-amplification were included in this study and their amplicons were used for ITS-2 sequencing. Of these 53 patients, 30 patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive, including 21 patients with non-severe COVID-19 and 9 severe/critical COVID-19 illness.

Samples of SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative individuals were processed simultaneously, including DNA extraction, amplicon PCRs, library preparation and amplicon sequencing. Rectal swab samples from the DNA/RNA Shield™ Collection Tube with Swab (Zymo Research, Freiburg, Germany) were used and stored in stabilizing DNA/RNA shield at -80°C until DNA extraction was performed. DNA was extracted using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research) with a bead-beating step with the Fast-Prep device (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) prior to DNA extraction. Libraries were prepared using the NEBNext® Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit. The ITS2 region was amplified with ITS3 (5′-GCATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC-3′) and ITS4 (5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) primers and samples were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 SP flowcell with PE250.

Demultiplexed fastq-files of forward and reverse reads per sample were analyzed using the QIIME2 (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology2) pipeline (Bolyen et al., 2019) with the DADA2-package. Chimeric sequences were filtered using the consensus method. We obtained a total of 3,972,700 quality-filtered sequences of 53 samples with a minimum of 15,821 and maximum of 128,935 sequences per sample and a mean/median number of 74,957/78,300 sequences per sample. Alpha diversity and beta diversity metrics were calculated with a rarefaction depth of 15,821 sequences. Taxonomy was assigned with a Naïve Bayes classifier, trained on the UNITE ITS database QIIME2 release (Version 8). Alpha diversity metrics, barplots, boxplots and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) were visualized with Dokdo, Version 1.7. Comparisons between categorical metadata columns and alpha diversity metrics were computed with Kruskal-Wallis test. To test for significant differences in beta diversity among groups, we used permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) of distance matrices with 999 permutations. Biomarkers were assessed using LEfSe (Linear discriminant effect size analysis) (Segata et al., 2011) with p<.05 for fungal class comparison using Kruskal-Wallis test and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) score >3.5. Taxa that could not be assigned to the phylum level were excluded from biomarker analysis and co-occurrence analysis.

Patient characteristics were tested using t-test for metric variables and Fisher exact test for categorical variables with a significance level <.05 using SPSS software (version 27.0).

Of 53 patients included for ITS2-sequencing, 23 patients were SARS-CoV-2 negative and 30 SARS-CoV-2 positive, including 21 patients with non-severe COVID-19 and 9 with severe/critical illness as classified by the WHO. Only one patient (1.9%) received antibiotics and no patient received antifungal therapy at the time point of rectal swab sampling. Variables that had been associated with alterations of the gut microbiome previously, including ethnicity, body-mass-index (BMI), smoking status and most medication including metformin, proton-pump inhibitors, laxatives and corticosteroids, taken at the time point of sampling did not differ between the groups of SARS-CoV-2 negative patients and patients with non-severe and severe/critical COVID-19 illness ( Table 1 ). The period between hospital admission and the time of rectal swab sampling was comparable for the groups. Male sex was more frequent in the group of SARS-CoV-2 negative patients 17 (74%) compared with non-severe (29%) and severe/critical COVID-19 illness (33%, p=.006). The age of patients with severe COVID-19 was higher compared with the other groups (p=.029). Comorbidities did not differ significantly between groups except for hypertension (p=.008), which was less frequently present in patients with non-severe COVID-19 compared to the other two groups. Characteristic symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 infection including cough (p=.017), fever (p=.001) and odor disorders (p=.001) were more prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with severe/critical and non-severe COVID-19 illness compared with SARS-CoV-2 negative patients.

Significant differences of alpha and beta diversity characterized the fungal gut microbiome of patients with severe/critical COVID-19 illness. Patients with severe/critical COVID-19 illness exhibited a lower Shannon diversity (p=.0047), richness (p=.0373) and evenness (.0062) of the fungal gut microbiome compared with non-severe COVID-19 patients ( Figure 1A ). Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of Bray Curtis phylum level distance matrix revealed clustering of patients with severe/critical COVID-19 illness and PERMANOVA multivariate analysis confirmed significant phylum level differences between the three groups (p=.048, Figure 1B ). The mean relative abundance of the dominating phylum Ascomycota was higher in patients with severe COVID-19 (96.5%) compared with 72.77% in patients with non-severe COVID-19 and 74.6% in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients ( Figure 1C ).

While no taxon was enriched in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients, 16 taxa of the fungal gut microbiome with LDA score >3.5 were enriched in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients when comparing SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. Among these were the yeast Debaryomyces and black yeast-like fungus Aureobasidium ( Figure 4B ). Twelve of these 16 taxa were taxa of the Ascomycota and four of the Basidiomycota phylum (all of the class Agaricomycetes).

The competition for nutrients or the production of metabolites affecting fungal growth are mechanisms by which fungi directly interact and affect the composition of the fungal gut microbiome (Richard and Sokol, 2019). To gain a better understanding of these networks, we analyzed the correlation at the genus level of the fungal gut microbiome. SARS-CoV-2 negative and SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were both characterized by three interconnected communities with positive co-occurrences between the members of each community. Interestingly, the members of these communities, as well as their interactions, differed significantly between both groups ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 1 ). The genera Fusarium, Gibberella, Sarocladium, Aureobasidium, Geomyces, Trichoderma and Phialemoniopsis were among the genera with the highest connectivity of positive correlations. The largest interconnected community (blue transparent polygon of Figure 5 ) was present in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients consisting of 32 positively-correlated genera with 30 genera of the Ascomycota and two genera of the Basidiomycota phylum. It comprised the genera Aureobasidium and Lophodermium, which are overrepresented in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Fungal species of the genus Aureobasidium produce antimicrobial peptides, as do other fungi in this interconnected community like Fusarium (Antonissen et al., 2014), Penicillium, and Trichoderma (Stracquadanio et al., 2020). This fungal sub-network comprised only 5 genera in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. A second interconnected community (green) was more developed and made up of 20 fungal genera in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients compared with SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (13 genera). The only genera assigned to other phyla than Ascomycota and Basidiomycota that were present in interconnected communities of the co-occurrence networks were the genera Mucor of Mucoromycota and a genus of Rozellomycota. Both were members of the third interconnected community in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (purple) containing 9 genera. They were both uncorrelated to the 6 genera of this interconnected network in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. Overall, this analysis shows a strong modulation of positive associations between fungal genera in SARS-CoV-2 positive in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 negative patients.

The fungal gut microbiome between SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with and without diarrhea did not reveal significant differences for alpha and beta diversity metrics. LEfSe did not identify any taxon with LDA >3.5 that discriminated SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with and without diarrhea (data not shown).

Patients with severe/critical COVID-19 illness in our study exhibited a fungal gut microbiome characterized by a reduced Shannon diversity, richness and evenness and by a relative enrichment of Ascomycota compared to patients with non-severe COVID-19 illness. Furthermore, distinct differences in the pronounced interconnected fungal communities characterized the gut microbiome of SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. The interconnected inter-kingdom networks between fungi and bacteria were sparse. Nevertheless, several anti-bacterial metabolites producing fungal genera exhibited different positive and negative correlations with several distinct bacterial genera in both groups, SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients.

As our study was cross-sectional, rather than longitudinal, we cannot be certain whether the fungal gut microbiome changes after infection and affects the course of disease, or if the composition of gut mycobiome is a predisposing factor for critical illness.

The distinct compositional differences of the fungal gut microbiome in SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in severe COVID-19 illness, studied from samples taken unaffected by the use of an antimicrobial therapy, illuminate the necessity of a broader approach to confirm the differences in the fungal gut microbiome in SARS-CoV-2 infection and to investigate whether the fungal microbiome changes are consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a predisposing factor for critical illness.
