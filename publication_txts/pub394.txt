Assessing the effect of interaction between C-reactive protein and gut microbiome on the risks of anxiety and depression

Cumulative evidence shows that gut microbiome can influence brain function and behavior via the inflammatory processes. However, the role of interaction between gut dysbiosis and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the development of anxiety and depression remains to be elucidated. In this study, a total of 3321 independent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci associated with gut microbiome were driven from genome-wide association study (GWAS). Using individual level genotype data from UK Biobank, we then calculated the polygenetic risk scoring (PRS) of 114 gut microbiome related traits. Moreover, regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the possible effect of interaction between gut microbiome and CRP on the risks of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (N = 113,693) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) (N = 114,219). At last, 11 candidate CRP × gut microbiome interaction with suggestive significance was detected for PHQ-9 score, such as F_Ruminococcaceae (β = − 0.009, P = 2.2 × 10–3), G_Akkermansia (β = − 0.008, P = 7.60 × 10–3), F_Acidaminococcaceae (β = 0.008, P = 1.22 × 10–2), G_Holdemanella (β = − 0.007, P = 1.39 × 10–2) and O_Lactobacillales (β = 0.006, P = 1.79× 10–2). 16 candidate CRP × gut microbiome interaction with suggestive significance was detected for GAD-7 score, such as O_Bacteroidales (β = 0.010, P = 4.00×  10–4), O_Selenomonadales (β = − 0.010, P = 1.20 × 10–3), O_Clostridiales (β = 0.009, P = 2.70 × 10–3) and G_Holdemanella (β = − 0.008, P = 4.20 × 10–3). Our results support the significant effect of interaction between CRP and gut microbiome on the risks of anxiety and depression, and identified several candidate gut microbiomes for them.

As common psychiatric disorders, the amount of people with depression and anxiety has increased over the past several decades leading to a growing concern in mental health research around the world [1]. According to the report of WHO, the global population suffering from depression was estimated to be 322 million, while anxiety disorders affected more than 260 million people, accounting for 4.4% and 3.6% of the global population respectively that resulted in a surge in suicide rates as well as a huge social and economic burden [2–4]. However, there are elusive pathogenesis and lackluster treatments in depression and anxiety.

In this study, data from UK biobank were applied to evaluate the influence of interactions between CRP and gut microbiome on anxiety and depression. Based on the significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with gut microbiome, we calculated PRS firstly. Then conducted linear regression to evaluate the influence of CPRxgut microbiome interactions on the risks of anxiety and depression.

Our study utilized the UK Biobank cohort (https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/), a prospective cohort study with a number of physical, health, and genetic data from approximately 500,000 individuals aged 40–69. This large-scale biomedical database includes detailed lifestyle information as well as blood, urine, and saliva samples of participants. The UK Biobank genetic data contains genotypes of 488,377 participants. These were assayed using the UK BiLEVE Axiom array and UK Biobank Axiom array. Marker-based quality control was performed by using statistical tests designed primarily to check for consistency of genotype calling across experimental factors to identify poor quality markers. SNPs with calling rate < 98.5%, MAF < 0.01 were removed. Samples with calling rate < 98.0% and mismatch between inferred sex and self-reported sex were removed. Imputation was carried out by IMPUTE4 (https://jmarchini.org/software/). Details of the array design, genotyping, and quality control procedures have been described previously [29]. All data usage in this article is approved by UK Biobank (application 46,478) and the Ethics Advisory Committee (EAC).

Our study contains 376,802 participants from UK Biobank with CRP data. The CRP was measured by immunoturbidimetric—high sensitivity analysis on a Beckman Coulter AU5800 when the participants were recruited and consent.

In this study, two common psychiatric disorders were analyzed, including depression and anxiety. We measured depression based on Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) which is a classification algorithm used to screen for and measure depression severity [30]. It focuses on nine depressive symptoms and signs, for example, Lack of interest or pleasure in doing things 20,514, Recent feelings of depression 20,510, Trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much 20,517, etc. The total score of it is 0–27. Meanwhile, anxiety severity was measured by general anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7) with a total score (0–21) [31]. It focuses on seven anxious symptoms and signs, for example, recent feelings or nervousness or anxiety 20,506, Recent inability to stop or control worrying 20,509, Recent worrying too much about different things 20,520, etc. We provide a detailed definition in the supplement. PHQ-9 score and GAD-7 score were used as continuous variables in this study.

The GWAS summary data sets of gut microbiome were derived from a recent large-scale study which included 114 gut microbiome related traits [32]. Briefly, they carried out the 515F/806R primer pair to amplify the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene for Flemish Gut Flora Project (FGFP) cohort individuals at first. Then carried out sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Fastq sequences were further analyzed per sample using the DADA2 pipeline (v.1.6). Linear models were fit with age, sex and the top ten principle components as covariates, along with each microbial trait analyzed in the GWAS. Genotyping was conducted on two different arrays—the Human Core Exome v1.0 and the Human Core Exome v1.1. For quality control, the SNPs with call rate < 95%, MAF < 0.01 and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium deviations P < 1 × 10–5 were removed. FGFP genotype data was phased using SHAPEIT3 and imputed with IMPUTE2 using UK10K and all 1000 Genome Project phase 3 samples as the reference panel. After association analyses, 3,321 LD independent loci associated with 16S gut microbiome phenotypes were identified. Specific for this study, the SNPs with P < 1.0 × 10−4 were selected for subsequent PRS analysis. Details of the array design, genotyping, and quality control procedures have been described previously [32].

In this study, we calculated the gut microbiome related PRS of each subject by using individual SNP genotype data of the UK Biobank. Based on self-reported ethnicity (UK Biobank data field: 21,000), the individuals were restricted to only “White British”. Let PRSn denote the PRS value of gut microbiome for the nth subject, defined as:

For the PHQ-9 score, 113,693 participants were selected; 55.7% of them were women, mean age was 56.23 years, and mean PHQ-9 score (SD) was – 2.71 (3.64). For the GAD-7 score, 114,219 participants were selected; 55.7% of them were women, mean age was 56.22 years, and mean GAD-7 score (SD) was − 0.28 (1.05).

We detected 11 CRP × gut microbiome interaction with suggestive significance for PHQ-9 score, such as F_Ruminococcaceae (β = − 0.009, P = 2.2 × 10–3), G_Akkermansia (β = − 0.008, P = 7.60 × 10–3), F_Acidaminococcaceae (β = 0.008, P = 1.22 × 10–2), G_Holdemanella (β = − 0.007, P = 1.39 × 10–2) and O_Lactobacillales (β = 0.006, P = 1.79 × 10–2). The details were shown in Table
1 and Fig. 1.

We detected 16 CRP × gut microbiome interaction with suggestive significance for anxiety GAD-7 score, like O_Bacteroidales (β = 0.010, P = 4.00 × 10–4), O_Selenomonadales (β = − 0.010, P = 1.20 × 10–3), O_Clostridiales (β = 0.009, P = 2.70 × 10–3) and G_Holdemanella (β = − 0.008, P = 4.20 × 10–3). The details were shown in Table
2 and Fig. 2.

We also compared the above association analysis results, found 4 common CRP × gut microbiome interactions for both PHQ-9 score and GAD-7 score: G_Holdemanella (β = − 0.007, P = 1.43 × 10–2 for depression and β = − 0.008, P = 4.30 × 10–3 for anxiety), G_Desulfovibrio (β = 0.007, P = 2.64 × 10–2 for depression and β = 0.008, P = 6.30 × 10–3 for anxiety), F_Coriobacteriaceae (β = − 0.006, P = 4.57 × 10–2 for depression and β = − 0.005, P = 4.46 × 10–2 for anxiety) and G_Barnesiella (β = − 0.006, P = 3.16 × 10–2 for depression and β = − 0.006, P = 4.96 × 10–2 for anxiety).

Although previous studies have found the functional relevance of gut microbiome and CRP with the development of anxiety and depression [34, 35], the biological mechanism underlying the effects of interaction between gut microbiome and CRP on the risks of anxiety and depression remains to be elucidated [36]. In this study, we explored the interaction between CRP and 114 gut microbiome-related traits and observed a significant interaction between them for depression and anxiety.

In summary, our results support the significant effect of interaction between CRP and gut microbiome on the risks of anxiety and depression, and identified several candidate gut microbiomes for them. These findings may provide novel therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders, and give insights into the mechanism of anxiety and depression. Further studies are eager to confirm our findings and clarify the more detailed mechanism of gut microbiome × CRP interaction in psychiatric disorders.
