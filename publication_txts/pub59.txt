Gut microbiome diversity and composition is associated with hypertension in women

Animal studies support a role for the gut microbiota in hypertension development, but large human studies are lacking. Here, we investigated the relationship between hypertension prevalence and gut microbial composition in two cohorts.

We included 871 unrelated TwinsUK women with faecal microbiome data (16s rRNA gene sequencing). Multivariable linear models adjusted for age, age2 and BMI as well as MiRKAT models, were used to estimate the association of hypertension with alpha- and beta-diversity metrics. To identify taxa associated with hypertension, a generalized additive model for location scale and shape was computed adjusting for covariates and multiple testing. Results were replicated in 448 women from PREDICT-1.

We found that measures of alpha diversity are significantly lower in hypertensive cases [Beta(95% confidence interval, 95% CI) = −0.05 (−0.095 to −0.004), P = 0.03] and a significant association between beta diversity and hypertension (FDR < 0.05). We identified and replicated two genera associated with hypertension. The genus, Ruminiclostridium 6 was less abundant in hypertension cases [meta-analysis (95% CI) = −0.31 (−0.5 to −0.13), P = 1 × 10−3]. The uncultured microbe Erysipelotrichacea-UCG003 was more abundant in hypertensive cases [meta-analysis (95% CI) = 0.46 (0.3–0.62), P = 1 × 10−4]. We genomically analysed the 16 s rRNA sequence and established a 100% identity match with the 16 s rRNA sequence of the genus Faecalibacillus. We functionally annotated Ruminiclostridium, identifying 83 metabolic pathways, including pathways previously linked to blood pressure regulation.

In this large human observation, we show that gut microbiome diversity and composition are associated with hypertension. Our results suggest that targeting the microbiome may be a novel means to prevent or treat hypertension.

Hypertension is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality affecting more than 1.3 billion people worldwide [1]. Given the burden of hypertension, any strategy that will improve blood pressure (BP) control will have major public health benefits [2]. The causation of hypertension is multifactorial [3], influenced by a host of genetic and environmental factors, including poor diet, obesity, inactivity and smoking, in addition to interactions between these factors [3]. The human microbiota comprises 10–100 trillion symbiotic microbial cells harboured by each person and is acquired from the environment starting at birth [4,5]. The gut microbiome, that is the community of microbes in the gastrointestinal tract, has been recently shown to be an important determinant of inflammation [6], obesity [7], type-2 diabetes [8] and arterial stiffness [9–11], all of which contribute to the risk of hypertension [12]. Moreover, animal studies suggest that gut microbes may act on downstream cellular targets, directly contributing to the pathogenesis of hypertension [9,13]. Recently, human studies have identified lower gut microbiome diversity [13–16] and specific gut microbes associated with hypertension [17,18]. In a recent review on gut microbiome composition and hypertension, Verhaar et al. [18] indicated the negative role of Gram-negative microbiota, including Klebsiella, Parabacteroides, Desulfovibrio and Prevotella and the possible neutral/protective role of Ruminococcaceae, Roseburia and Faecalibacterium[18]. Previous research into the gut microbial composition to hypertension also highlights the enrichment of Eubacterium[19], Lactobacillus[14], Megasphaera[14] and Rothia[14], and the depletion of Bacteroides[19], Enterococcus[20], Oscillibacter[16]. Moreover, a large study on 7928 individuals showed the periodontal microbiome, including Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella parvula and Prevotella melaninogenica, to be involved in BP regulation, suggesting the possible pro-hypertensive role of bacteria and bacterial products throughout the gastrointestinal tract and the mouth [21,22]. However, human studies are typically small and therefore underpowered, lack independent replication and there is a paucity of population-based evidence. Here, we first investigated the association between hypertension, and gut microbiome composition. We looked at the relationship between hypertension and the loss of microbiome composition and with specific genera in 871 people from TwinsUK. We then replicated our results in an independent population and further genomically characterise the hypertension-associated microbes using their 16s rRNA sequences.

Study participants were female-unrelated individuals enrolled in the TwinsUK registry, a national register of adult twins recruited as volunteers without selecting for any particular disease or traits [23]. Here, we analysed data from 871 unrelated women from TwinsUK [23]. Twins provided informed written consent and the study was approved by St. Thomas’ Hospital Research Ethics Committee (REC Ref: EC04/015). Data relevant to our analysis includes BP, antihypertensive drug use, BMI, age and gut microbiome composition assessed using 16 s rRNA, as described below.

The replication cohort consisted of an independent sample of 448 women from the UK-based PREDICT 1 study with analogous data. The PREDICT-1 study [24] was a single-arm nutritional intervention conducted between June 2018 and May 2019. Study participants were healthy individuals (thus eliminating potential confounders brought about by the presence of infections or other comorbidities) aged between 18 and 65 years recruited from the TwinsUK registry [23], and the general population using online advertising. Participants attended a full day clinical visit consisting of test meal challenges followed by a 13-day home-based phase, as previously described [24].

BP was measured by a trained nurse using either the Marshall mb02, the Omron Mx3 or the Omron HEM713C Digital Blood Pressure Monitor (Omron Healthcare, Hoofddorp, Netherlands) performed with the patient in the sitting position for at least 3 min. At each visit, the cuff was placed on the individual's arm so that it was approximately 2–3 cm above the elbow joint of the inner arm, with the air tube lying over the brachial artery. The individual's arm was placed on the table or supported with the palm facing upwards, so that the tab of the cuff was placed at the same level of the heart. Triplicate measurements were taken with an interval of approximately 1 min between each reading, with mean of second and third measurements recorded.

Participants were classified into two groups based on their BP level, age and use of BP lowering drugs: hypertension cases (<60 years of age, with SBP ≥140 mmHg, or DBP ≥90 mmHg, or currently using antihypertensive drugs, or started using before 60 years); and controls (if age > 50 years, SBP ≤120 mmHg and DBP ≤80 mmHg, and not on BP-lowering medication, or if age ≤50, SBP ≤115 mmHg and DBP ≤80 mmHg and not on BP-lowering medication).

Gut microbiome composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as previously described [4]. Briefly, the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq. 16S sequences were demultiplexed in QIIME. Amplicon sequence variants (ASV) were then generated using the DADA2 package in R using the pipeline described elsewhere [25]. Observed ASVs and beta diversities were computed using the R packages ‘vegan’ [26] and ‘microbiome’ [27].

Statistical analysis was done using R 4.0.2 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).

We replicated significant genera (at P < 0.05) in PREDICT 1 and results were combined using an inverse variance random effect meta-analysis [30].

All genomes isolated from the human gut belonging to the hypertension-associated microbes (Ruminiclostridium and the Erysipelotrichaceae) families were downloaded from the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome catalogue [31] [and RefSeq data set (January 2021) for the Erysipelotrichaceae family]. CheckM v1.1.3 [32] was then ran using the ‘lineage_wf’ workflow to estimate genomic completeness and contamination. For Erysipelotrichaceae genera, we used high-quality genomes (<3% contamination, >95% completeness) of representative species. Whereas for the Faecalibacillus genus, we used the genomes of all existent species.

As Erysipelotrichaceae UCG003 was uncultured, we performed a genomic evolutionary analysis to investigate close relationships with other microbes. We predicted the 16S rRNA sequences of the representative Erysipelotrichaceae species using barrnap v0.9 (http://www.vicbioinformatics.com/software.barrnap.shtml). The predicted sequences together with the 16S rRNA sequence of Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 were then aligned using MUSCLE v3.8.1551 [33]. From which, we estimated the maximum-likelihood phylogeny with PhyML v3 [34] implemented in SeaView v5.0.4 [35], using the general time reversible (GTR) model of evolution, with optimized number of variant sites, nucleotide equilibrium frequencies and across site rate variation, and 100 bootstrap replicates. The constructed phylogenetic tree was then visualized using Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) [36]. In addition, we queried the 16S rRNA sequence of Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 in the RDP classifier [37] and BLASTn [38]. In BLASTn, the search was filtered by organism [Erysipelotrichaceae (taxid:128827)].

To perform the functional analysis of Ruminiclostridium, we filtered genomes by a higher standard (>95% completeness, <1% contamination and <300 contigs). Missing sample accession numbers were obtained from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database of the NCBI, and the genomes from sample identifiers not found in the NCBI were discarded. Duplicated genomes were removed, keeping the genome with the highest N50 value. After filtering, we ran Prokka v1.12 [39] in 565 remaining Ruminiclostridium genomes while specifying the genus (parameter --genus) to retrieve the gff files. Specifically, enzyme commission numbers were extracted to identify the Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [40] pathways using MiniPath (Minimal set of Pathways) (version: September 2020) [41]. All the KEGG identifiers related to environmental information processing and organismal systems were removed. For each metabolic pathway, the number of genomes that presented such pathway was calculated.

We included 871 unrelated women (397 cases, 474 controls) from TwinsUK, aged 56 (±11.3) years and overweight, with an average BMI of 26 kg/m2 (±5) and we replicated our results in an independent sample of 448 women (57 cases, 391 controls) from the PREDICT-1 study, aged 44.8 (±12.1) with an average BMI of 25.1 kg/m2 (±5.1). Descriptive characteristics of the study populations are summarized in Table
1.

We then performed a genomic analysis to uncover the Erysipelotrichaceae genus’ evolution as it was uncultured. After constructing a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree using the 16S rRNA sequences of Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 and the different genera within the Erysipelotrichaceae family, we identify that Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 is closely related to existent species of the Faecalibacillus genus, namely, F. intestinalis, F. sp. H12 and F. faecis, sharing the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) (Fig.
4). To further interpret these results, we conducted a search using the 16S rRNA sequence of Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 as a query in the RDP classifier and in BLASTn search. The RDP classifier obtained a unique match to the Faecalibacillus genus with 100% identity. BLASTn search reported an E-value of 2 × 10−117, and a 100% identity and query and query cover with sequences from the species Faecalibacillus intestinalis and Faecalibacillus faecis.

In this large-scale human study investigating the association between gut microbiome composition and hypertension with an independent replication, we report that gut microbiome diversity is inversely associated with hypertension in women (Fig.
1, Figure S1). We also identify two genera, an uncultured genus of the Erysipelotrichaceae family, whose relative abundance is higher in hypertensive cases and that of Ruminiclostridium 6, whereby abundance was lower in hypertensive individuals (Fig.
2).

In conclusion, we find that gut microbiome diversity and composition are associated with hypertension. Our results suggest that targeting the microbiome may be a novel way to prevent or treat hypertension. Foremost, more research is necessary to further corroborate correlations between the gut microbiome and hypertension and provide insights into mechanistic capacity of the gut microbiome to control BP.
