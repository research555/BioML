Putative modulation of the gut microbiome by probiotics enhances preference for novelty in a preliminary double-blind placebo-controlled study in ferrets

Increasing evidence suggests a causal relationship between the gut microbiome and psychiatric illnesses. In particular, autism spectrum disorder is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and alterations in the gut microbiome. Administration of probiotics is a commonly used strategy by caregivers of people with neurodevelopmental illness. However, evidence for successful improvement in gut microbiome and (behavioral) symptoms has been lacking.

Here, we use a novel ferret model of maternal immune activation to show that high-dose probiotic administration in a placebo-controlled study design causes changes in the gut microbiome in the form of a transient increase in the administered bacterial species. In contrast, we found no differences in baseline microbiome composition or changes induced by probiotic administration between animals exposed in utero to maternal immune activation and control animals. However, the relative presence of several bacterial species correlated with an increased preference for novelty (object and conspecific). Intriguingly, several of the hits in this screen are species that have previously emerged in the literature as being associated with autism and anxiety.

Together, our results suggest that high-dose probiotic interventions may be beneficial for the adjunct treatment of psychiatric illnesses. Placebo-controlled clinical trials in humans are urgently needed.

There is growing evidence for a causal relationship between the composition of the gut microbiome and behavior. One of the most striking examples is that neurodevelopmental disorders appear to be related to the physiology of the gastrointestinal tract. A well-documented aspect of this link is the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often experience gastrointestinal distress [1]. Symptoms of abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and bloating are common throughout childhood and may persist into adulthood in this patient population [2]. Interestingly, the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms appear to correlate with the severity of developmental symptoms in children with ASD [3]. The etiology of ASD and the symptoms associated with it remain unclear. However, it is worth noting that differences in naturally occurring bacterial colonies can be found in the microbiome of individuals with ASD when compared to typically developing individuals [1]. There is also evidence that malabsorption and maldigestion of certain macromolecules in children with ASD are correlated to changes in gut microbiota at the genus and species level [4].

Some of these microbiome changes have been replicated in animal models. For example, a recent study in a mouse model of ASD has demonstrated pathological changes in gastrointestinal physiology and microbial composition [5]. In this model, maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy (at a time point corresponding to the second trimester in humans) is used as an early perturbation to the developmental trajectory [6]. Intriguingly, administration of healthy bacteria (“probiotics”) to juvenile MIA mice in order to supplement their original gut microbiota composition was successful in not only partially restoring gastrointestinal health but also alleviating several of the ASD-like behavioral phenotypes [5]. This study demonstrated a general dysbiosis in the gut microbiota in juvenile MIA mice as well as the ability to modulate the gut microbiome by supplementing with probiotics. Despite this, it has remained unclear if probiotic interventions have long term effects and whether they modulate the gut ecosystem and behavior in the adult offspring in the MIA model. To address this gap, we performed a double-blind placebo-controlled probiotic intervention study in adult ferrets in our recently developed ferret MIA model [7]. Ferrets share important features of structure and function of the central nervous system with humans [8, 9] and have emerged as promising, cost-effect intermediate model system for translational neuroscience studies [10].

Twenty adult (6 months of age) male ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) were used in this study. These animals were housed separately on a 12-h light-dark cycle. Animals had ad libitum access to food and water. All animals were fed with Teklad 2072 ferret diet (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN). The manufacturer lists the following average nutrient profile for this diet: 39% protein, 19% fat, 1.2% crude fiber. All animal procedures were performed in compliance with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals (NIH Publications no. 8023, revised 1978), and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA Animal Welfare).

The adult ferrets used in this study were born to 6 pregnant ferrets in house. As previously described [7], at G30, i.e., day 30 of gestation, the pregnant mother animals were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg/kg PolyIC (polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, potassium salt, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, dissolved 10 mg/ml in PBS) or 1 ml/kg PBS via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection under anesthesia introduced by 4–5% then sustained by 1–2% isoflurane. Immune activation was confirmed by elevated rectal temperature measurements taken immediately before and 3 hours after the PBS or PolyIC injection. Blood samples (0.5 ml) were also drawn from the jugular vein at the same time points. Serum cytokine level (IL1β, IL-2, IL-6, INF-γ and TNFα) was then detected by the UNC Animal Clinical Chemistry and Gene Expression Laboratory using multiplexed biomarker immunoassays (Luminex MAGPIX system, Luminex Inc., Austin, TX, using the canine cytokine kit). Ferret offspring (kits) were born at around G40-G41. The kits were kept with their mother until weaning at postnatal day 42. At this time, the male ferrets were separated for single housing [7].

The probiotics used in this study was VSL #3 (Alpha Sigma, Covington, LA), a mixture of 8 strains of lactic acid–producing bacteria (L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus, L. casei, L. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, B. longum, B. infantis, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus) [11]. We chose to use VSL#3 since it includes several different gram-positive strains as we had no a priori hypothesis for which strain would be the most beneficial in the context of our study. VSL#3 has been investigated in several other animal models such as dogs [12] and rodents [13–17]. Thus, further motivation for the choice of probiotic brand was to build on these previous studies. The VSL#3 was shipped in a cooler with cool packs and was immediately refrigerated at arrival until preparation for administration. The VSL#3 suspension was prepared daily by diluting 4.5 × 109 colony-forming units (CFU) of freeze-dried VSL#3 in 10 ml Kitty Milk Replacement (KMR).

All ferrets received 10 ml of KMR with probiotics or KMR alone every day in the evening for 6 consecutive days. All animals were also placed on 12 h of water restriction per day during this time. Weight variations and changes in health condition were monitored and none occurred. Water restriction before administration of the probiotic mixture helped the ferrets more easily accept 10 ml of liquid without the discomfort. The 10 ml of fluid were fed to the animal with a syringe without needle. Care was taken that the animal swallowed the fluid. All adult ferrets (10 each from the PBS or PolyI:C condition) were randomly chosen to receive either the probiotic mixture or KMR alone, creating 4 groups (Probiotic:PolyI:C, Probiotic:PBS, KMR;PolyI:C, KMR:PBS).

The researchers involved with the administration of the interventions and behavioral assays were blinded to the experimental condition of all animals. This included both the identity of the animal pertaining to their assignment to the MIA or control (PBS) group as well as assignment to probiotics or control (KMR).

Stool collections took place in the housing facilities of the animals. Stool samples were taken 3 times. Collection time points are labeled with letters A, B, and C throughout the manuscript. Collection A was performed 22 days before the first day of probiotic treatment as a baseline. Collection B was performed 2 days after the probiotic treatment concluded in order to avoid recording a predictably high number of bacteria sourced from the probiotic itself. Collection C occurred 9 days after the probiotic treatment concluded.

On each collection day, each single house cage was cleared of enrichment materials and litter boxes and disinfected with Vimoba 128 (Quip Laboratories, Wilmington, DE). Each sample was collected within 5 min of deposit and immediately frozen in a dry ice bath (−80o C) before further processing. The 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing was performed at the University of North Carolina Microbiome Core Facility (Chapel Hill, NC) as previously described [7]. Briefly, DNA was extracted from stool samples using MagMAX Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). From this DNA the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified. This PCR product was purified and then used to generate a sequencing library for sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq instrument.

Behavioral tests were performed around the time-point of the first sample collection (Time-point A) and after sample collection at Time Point C. No behavioral assessments were performed at Timepoint B since the goal of the study was to investigate behavioral changes after completion of a course of probiotic administration. All behavioral tests were performed in a well-illuminated white 1.5 X 1.5 m2 arena as previously described [7]. The arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol between tests on different animals, and the tests were conducted by experimenters blind to the group membership of the animals. The activity within the box was captured by a top-mounted camera as previously described (Microsoft LifeCam Cinema 720p HD Webcam, 30 Hz frame rate) [7].

This social interaction test has historically been used to investigate how animals interact with strange and familiar conspecifics. A three chamber paradigm test has been successfully utilized in rodent studies to observe social affiliation and social memory [21–23]. This test is also used to measure ASD related behavioral changes [5, 24]. In the ferret version of this task, two identical cages were placed within the arena 15 cm away from the walls. The cages are 49 × 33 × 26 cm3 (L x W x H) and have windows at all four sides and were weighed down with 10 lb. weights (Fig.
1). The animal was placed into the arena with the empty cages to acclimate for 10 min before the next phase. Once the test animal was removed from the arena, a “stranger” animal of identical sex that was not utilized in this study was placed in one of the cages. The test animal was replaced in the arena for 10 min. The sociability of the animal is determined by subtracting the amount of time the animal spends interacting with the empty cage from the amount of time it spends interacting with the cage containing the stranger. Following this phase, another stranger was placed into the other cage. The familiar and stranger animal locations on either side of the arena were randomized across the study. The interactions of the test animal were recorded again for 10 min. The social preference of the animal is characterized by subtracting the time spent interacting with the familiar animal from the time spent interacting with the stranger. All cages and the surrounding arena were cleaned with 70% ethanol between tests.

BORIS software [25] was used to manually log behavioral events in novel object recognition and social interaction test as previously described [7]. BORIS enables frame-by-frame analysis of a video and allows recording of the duration of interaction in each assay. In analyzing the novel object recognition video, we logged the time periods during which the animal actively explored either of the objects by pointing their noise towards the object. For the social interaction videos, we logged the timing when the animal explored either of the cages in a similar way.

Initial analysis of the microbiome sequencing data, including quality control of the fastq files, quantification of operational taxonomical units (OTUs), and calculation of alpha and beta diversity, was performed as previously described [7]. Briefly, fastq files were quality filtered for reads with > 70% of bases having a quality score > 24 using FastQC. QIIME [26] was used to join quality filtered fastqs and align them to the GreenGenes 13 05 reference of 16S rRNA sequences, to pick and quantify OTUs (UCLUST), and calculate alpha and beta diversity (samples rarefied at depth of 1000 for alpha diversity). An empty sample was included as a control for reagent contamination. This sample generated only 136 reads and did not have any identifiable OTUs, ruling out any significant reagent contamination. Differences in groups by beta diversity were tested using QIIME’s implementation of the PERMANOVA test (p < 0.05 considered significant).

To identify OTUs that may connect probiotic treatment with changes in behavior, we filtered for OTUs that were correlated with either time at novel animal or time at novel object and with at least one of the three probiotic organism OTUs. For all correlation tests, we filtered for a correlation coefficient (Spearman’s rho) greater than 0.3 and a p value less than 0.1. Although a p value less than 0.05 is generally considered to be statistically significant, we chose the higher p value threshold to capture correlations that were trending significance. All correlation tests and plots were generated in R. Correlation tests of significance were performed using Algorithm AS 89 as implemented in cor.test(). Plots of probiotic quantities at the three time points were generated using the ggplot2 package using the loess method to smooth the curves.

The overall goal of this study was to investigate if a probiotic intervention alters the gut microbiome in ferrets and whether such changes alter behavior. We focused our investigation on the novel object and novel animal assays since they have obvious conceptual parallels with symptoms in ASD [23] and also showed robust deficits when compared to health animals in our previous work [7]. The study comprised three interrelated questions: (1) Does probiotic supplementation modulate behavior? (2) Does probiotic supplementation alter the gut microbiome? (3) Do changes in gut microbiome correlate with changes in behavior?

We tested whether probiotic treatment modulates performance in the novel object and novel animal assays. We first established if our previously published MIA intervention was successful in this current study by examining body temperature and cytokine levels of the ferrets pregnant with the offspring investigated here. To confirm that PolyIC injections triggered a maternal immune response, we measured the body temperature (Table 1) and elevation of maternal serum cytokine IL1-β, IL-2, IL-6, INF-γ, TNF-α (Table 2) three hours after injection. Elevation of serum concentration of these cytokines has been established in a mouse model [27] and in our previous ferret study [7]. Concentration of TNF-α was significantly higher in animals that received PolyIC injections compared to animals that received PBS (control) injection. Levels of IL-6 as well as body temperatures was trend-level higher in those animals that received PolyIC injections, as well (body temperature after injection: PolyIC = 39.10 ± 1.15 °C, n = 4; PBS = 37.90 ± 0.22 °C, n = 4, unpaired t test, t (9) = 2.05, p = 0.087). We note that the small number of pregnant ferrets used for this study did not suffice to have enough statistical power for this exploratory analysis.

MIA and control animals were treated with probiotics dissolved in milk or milk without probiotics in a double-blind placebo-controlled study design. The behavioral tests were performed before and after the 6 days of probiotics administration. After collecting behavioral data from the 20 animals, each video was coded for interaction with either the novel object or novel animal in the arena. Quantitative values were assigned to interactions based on the percent of time spent with the familiar object or animal subtracted from the time spent with the novel object or animal. We did not find evidence for differences in change in behavior when comparing the results from before and after the intervention between the four groups (Table
3). We hypothesized that the variability of response to probiotic treatment, combined with the relatively low number of animals in our study was obscuring the effects of probiotics on behavior. Because of this, we next examined the change in microbiome and its relationship between behavior (from the post intervention behavioral analysis) and composition of the microbiome regardless of maternal exposure (PolyIC or PBS) group.

We first tested grouping of samples by probiotic treatment and maternal PolyI:C exposure after characterizing and quantifying OTUs in fecal samples. There was no significant difference in beta diversity between animals with maternal PolyI:C exposure and controls prior to probiotic (PERMANOVA p > 0.05, Table
4), and in agreement with the behavioral analyses, there was no significant difference in beta diversity after treatment between animals grouped by probiotic treatment or maternal PolyI:C exposure (PERMANOVA p > 0.05, Table
4). These results were consistent with our failure to find evidence for differences in behavioral performance as a function of either probiotic treatment and PolyI:C exposure. We thus collapsed the data across PolyI:C exposure to investigate if there were changes in the microbiome associated with probiotic administration when compared to placebo. To determine when probiotics may have their greatest effect on the gut microbiome, we performed an exploratory analysis by plotting the average probiotic organism frequency across the three time points (Fig.
2). All three probiotic organisms peaked at time point B and then fell back to approximately baseline at time point C. The normalized increase in relative frequency for the probiotic group (green) was numerically larger than for the control (KMR, blue) group. These findings suggest that probiotic administration caused an increased in certain species.

Due to the lack of significant changes in the microbiome by treatement group, we decided to correlate OTU frequency with probiotic organism frequency and behavior data to more directly test whether probiotic treatment could be connected to behavioral changes via changes in the microbiome. In fecal samples from the 20 animals, we identified 273 OTUs at the genus level. Of these 273, 101 had a frequency greater than 0 in at least half of all animals and were therefore used for correlation analysis. Probiotic organism frequency at timepoint B was used for correlation analysis as our prior results showed probiotic organism frequency peaking at B (Fig.
2). OTU frequency at time point C was used, as this time point was closest to when the behavioral data after the intervention were collected. The goal of this analysis was to identify OTUs that exhibited a persistent modulation by probiotic treatment that also had effects on behavior. This analysis allows for the identification of potential causal links between probiotic treatment and behavioral performance in the presence of high inter-individual compositional variability of the intestinal microbiome. Given our filtering thresholds for correlation (Spearman’s Rho > 0.3, p < 0.1), we identified six OTUs (time point C) correlated with percent time at novel object and six other OTUs (time point C) correlated with percent time at novel animal that were also correlated with at least one probiotic organism at time point B (Table
5). An OTU for one of the probiotic organisms itself, Bifidobacterium was correlated with novel animal behavior. Several of these OTUs had been previously reported to be associated with autism and anxiety phenotypes. Plots for these OTUs (OTU frequency at time point C versus behavior and time point B probiotic organism frequency) are shown in Fig.
3. All 273 OTUs identified, and their full correlation results are found in Supplementary Table 1. Together, these results suggest that changes in composition of the gut microbiome are related to the two novelty behaviors examined in our study.

In this study we were able to identify bacterial genera that putatively link reduction of an autism-like phenotype in ferrets with frequency of probiotic organisms after treatment. Our original hypothesis that the behavior of MIA animals would be normalized by probiotic treatment was not supported at the treatment group level, as the behavioral tests in this study did not yield significant or trending-significant differences between animals that received probiotic intervention to those that did not. We also tested for differences in the microbiome between MIA animals and control animals at baseline, and within groups before and after treatment. Again, there were no significant differences detected at the treatment group level. Previously, we have reported baseline differences between MIA and control animals [28]. In the previous study, the effect was strongest in females and muted in males. The present study used only male animals, as the social behavioral abnormalities were more pronounced in males in our previous study of MIA in the ferret.

In conclusion, our study suggests that probiotics alter the gut microbiome and that these changes are correlated with behavioral phenotype of two assays of interest in novelty in ferrets. Given the potential of the ferret for the study of perturbations such as maternal immune activation that are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, our findings open a new avenue towards a holistic understanding of the etiology of psychiatric illnesses and potential new treatment strategies based on targeted modulation of the gut microbiome.
