Influence of gastrectomy for gastric cancer treatment on faecal microbiome and metabolome profiles

Recent evidence points to the gut microbiome’s involvement in postoperative outcomes, including after gastrectomy. Here, we investigated the influence of gastrectomy for gastric cancer on the gut microbiome and metabolome, and how it related to postgastrectomy conditions.

We performed shotgun metagenomics sequencing and capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analyses on faecal samples collected from participants with a history of gastrectomy for gastric cancer (n=50) and compared them with control participants (n=56).

The gut microbiota in the gastrectomy group showed higher species diversity and richness (p<0.05), together with greater abundance of aerobes, facultative anaerobes and oral microbes. Moreover, bile acids such as genotoxic deoxycholic acid and branched-chain amino acids were differentially abundant between the two groups (linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe): p<0.05, q<0.1, LDA>2.0), as were also Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes modules involved in nutrient transport and organic compounds biosynthesis (LEfSe: p<0.05, q<0.1, LDA>2.0).

Our results reveal alterations of gut microbiota after gastrectomy, suggesting its association with postoperative comorbidities. The multi-omic approach applied in this study could complement the follow-up of patients after gastrectomy.

Recent evidence indicates the involvement of the gut microbiome in disease onset and progression and in postoperative outcome.1–3 A study on the gut mucosal microbiota following ileocolonic resection for Crohn’s disease revealed that microbial community structure was associated with disease recurrence or maintenance of remission.4 Accordingly, microbiota structure might play a role in clinical outcomes.

Increasing evidence indicates a possible link between gut microbiota and postoperative outcome after gastrectomy. For example, patients with gastric cancer could be at an increased risk of developing metachronous cancer including colorectal cancer (CRC) after gastrectomy.13 14 Because the gut microbiota is known to be associated with CRC,15–17 it may also affect development of metachronous CRC in postgastrectomy patients. Here, we characterised the faecal microbiome of patients with a history of gastrectomy for gastric cancer and compared them with control participants. To provide a better understanding of microbial metabolism, we complemented these data with metabolome profiles. The study aims to comprehensively characterise the influence of gastrectomy for gastric cancer on the gut microbiome, with the intention of improving nutrition and follow-up examinations in postgastrectomy patients.

The samples and clinical information used in this study were obtained under conditions of informed consent and with the approval of the institutional review board of each participating institute. A total of 106 participants undergoing total colonoscopy at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan, were enrolled. Fifty participants had previously undergone gastrectomy for gastric cancer and did not show signs of gastric cancer recurrence. Those who showed abnormal findings, including precancerous lesions such as adenomatous polyps or carcinomas, were excluded. The remaining 56 participants who did not show any colorectal findings, nor had any history of gastroenterological surgery were included as controls (table 1 and online supplementary tables S1 and S2).

Statistical test performed: Mann-Whitney U test for numerical data and Fisher’s exact test for categorical data; n, number of participants.

F, female; M, male.

Faecal samples were collected immediately at the first defaecation after starting the oral administration of bowel cleansing agents at the hospital on the day of colonoscopy.15 18 The samples were placed directly on dry ice and subsequently stored at −80°C for metagenomic and metabolomic analyses. The participants’ lifestyle data, including dietary habits and medical records, were acquired from questionnaires (475 questions, 25 pages), based on the example used in the Japan Public Health Center study19 (online supplementary figure S1A).

DNA extraction and shotgun metagenomic sequencing of faecal samples (online supplementary methods) generated, on average, 57, 888, 536 reads per sample and read quality was assessed (online supplementary figure S1B and supplementary table S3). We quantified the metabolites in faecal samples from 44 gastrectomy and 54 control participants using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry20 (online supplementary methods).

Metagenomic sequencing results were subjected to taxonomic and functional profiling following read quality filtering (online supplementary figure S1B and supplementary methods). Taxonomic profiling using the mOTU pipeline annotated 606 species,21 whereas 403 species-level clades were obtained using the MetaPhlAn2 pipeline.22 We categorised the annotated species as oral microbes or others based on the expanded Human Oral Microbiome Database23 (online supplementary methods). High-level phenotypes were identified by BugBase24 (online supplementary methods).

Functional profiles were generated using our in-house pipeline (online supplementary methods) and the Human Microbiome Project Unified Metabolic AnalysisNetwork 2 (HUMAnN2) pipeline.25 Annotation results were then summarised into Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology (KO) and KEGG modules26 profiles (online supplementary figure S1B and supplementary methods). We annotated 498 KEGG modules that collectively contained 6,108 KOs from our in-house pipeline. For the HUMAnN2 pipeline, we used UniRef90 as reference and acquired 437 KEGG modules containing 5,971 KOs.

Low-frequency and less abundant microbial features (species, functional modules and metabolites) were discarded (online supplementary methods). Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) with Bray-Curtis distance was used to examine the separation of species and metabolites across samples. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) (‘adonis’ function, vegan package in R) was applied to test microbial composition between groups. Chao1 richness and Shannon-Wiener alpha-diversity index were calculated to estimate microbial diversity between gastrectomy and control groups. Differences in relative abundance of the microbial features were determined by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe)27 (online supplementary methods).

We estimated genus and species association in each group using SparCC29 (bootstrap n=5000) on selected significantly different genera and species that overlapped between mOTU and MetaPhlAn2 annotations. Significant co-occurrence and co-excluding interaction (SparCC correlation scores ⍴<−0.2 or >0.2 with p<0.05) were visualised and analysed using igraph. To determine inter-omics (species and metabolome) correlations, we performed Procrustes analysis (online supplementary methods). Additionally, Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed on significantly different metabolites and genera to assess their putative correlation (online supplementary methods). Finally, we applied metabolic model-based integration of metabolite observations and species abundances (MIMOSA)30 to compare the predicted and measured metabolome trends (online supplementary methods).

Participants’ characteristics did not show significant differences between the gastrectomy (n=50) and control (n=56) groups (table 1 and online supplementary table S1). BMI (two-sided MWU test: p=1.22×10−5) and total cholesterol (two-sided MWU test: p=0.0145) were significantly lower in the gastrectomy group, although average cholesterol content was within the normal range (128–219 mg/dL) in each group. Preoperational BMI data for 47 (94%) gastrectomy participants indicated lower BMI at the time of faecal sampling (paired sample t-test: p=7.00×10−5) than prior to surgery, suggesting that weight loss could be attributed to postoperative malnutrition, for example, as a result of dumping syndrome.31 Fifteen postgastrectomy patients (30%) experienced dumping syndrome.

Underlying comorbidities and concurrent medication of the participants may influence gut microbiota. The number of participants using gastric acid secretion inhibitors and diabetes therapeutic drugs varied significantly between the gastrectomy and control groups. Statistical analyses on subsets of the original participants that excluded such users confirmed the lack of any effect of the exclusion on originally reported gastrectomy-enriched microbiome and metabolome signatures (online supplementary results and supplementary tables S6 and S7). The microbial features that were significantly enriched (LEfSe: p<0.05, q<0.1, LDA>2.0) in control individuals who took gastric acid secretion inhibitors or diabetes therapeutic drugs are also reported (online supplementary results and supplementary tables S8 and S9).

The gastrectomy group showed higher Chao1 index (mOTU: p=4.64×10−4; MetaPhlAn2: p=1.93×10−6) (figure 2A and B) and Shannon diversity index (mOTU: p=0.0954; MetaPhlAn2: p=0.0104) (figure 2C and D) for species composition than their control counterparts. Higher Shannon diversity indices were conserved across the three major phyla: Firmicutes (mOTU: p=8.98×10−7; MetaPhlAn2: p=2.91×10−4), Actinobacteria (mOTU: p=7.69×10−4; MetaPhlAn2: p=0.0419) and Bacteroidetes (mOTU: p=0.225; MetaPhlAn2: p=0.0283) (figure 2E and F). Our results were in accordance with previous studies, in that species diversity was higher in patients with postgastrectomy gastric cancer12 and obesity9 32 33 than in non-surgical participants.

Several taxa, mostly Bacilli, were significantly enriched in the gastrectomy group compared with controls (LEfSe: p<0.05, q<0.1, LDA>2.0) (figure 3A and B). Bacilli were previously reported to be enriched in the gut12 and gastric microbiota of patients after gastrectomy for gastric cancer.11 In obesity cases, Bacilli can be used to discriminate between postgastrectomy patients and non-surgical controls.32

Oral microbes (eg, Streptococcus, Veillonella, Prevotella) were relatively more abundant (two-sided MWU test: p<0.01) in the gastrectomy group (figure 3C and D), as did also aerobes and facultative anaerobes based on phenotype prediction (figure 3E and F, MWU: p=6.43×10−7, p=0.0337, respectively).

To examine the functional consequences of microbial community changes, we annotated 73 KEGG modules (based on our in-house pipeline) and 119 KEGG modules (based on the HUMAnN2 pipeline) that were differentially abundant (LEfSe: p<0.05, q<0.1, LDA>2.0) between the gastrectomy and control groups (online supplementary table S12 and supplementary figure S6). Among the KEGG modules identified as differentially abundant by both pipelines were those for membrane transport, biosynthesis of organic compounds, multidrug resistance, two-component regulatory system (TCS) and others (figure 4A). In the membrane transport system, phosphate and several amino acid transporters were particularly enriched in the gastrectomy group, followed by manganese/iron and vitamin B12 transporters. Our results were in agreement with those reported in a previous obesity study.9 On the contrary, modules involved in raffinose/stachyose/melibiose transport, along with isoleucine and cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis, were enriched in the controls. We also observed significantly higher abundance of modules related to TCS and multidrug resistance in the gastrectomy group. KEGG modules’ association with the participants’ demographic characteristics revealed that control or gastrectomy group classification had a predominant impact on module composition (MaAsLin: p<0.05, q<0.1, online supplementary table S12).

To compare module composition between gastrectomy and control groups, we estimated species richness (Chao1) and alpha-diversity (Shannon-Wiener) of each module contributor previously confirmed by our in-house and HUMAnN2 pipelines based on the HUMAnN2 output (online supplementary table S13). The three most abundant modules in the control group, raffinose/stachyose/melibiose transport system (M00196), isoleucine biosynthesis (M00535) and cobalamin biosynthesis (M00122), had significantly higher species diversity and richness in the gastrectomy group (figure 4B and online supplementary table S13). Whereas the dominant species were identical among the two groups, their proportions were different. For example, Bacteroides vulgatus contributed predominantly to cobalamin biosynthesis in both groups; however, Escherichia coli was a major module contributor in the gastrectomy group (figure 4B). We also detected three different microbes’ groups that contributed to the enrichment of three different KEGG modules involved in manganese/iron/zinc/copper transport (online supplementary figure S7). Overall, these findings indicate a microbial community-level shift followed by an alteration in functional potential.

We observed different enrichment of metabolites between control (n=54) and gastrectomy (n=44) participants (figure 4C) (52 vs 46 metabolites, respectively; LEfSe: p<0.05, q<0.1, LDA>2.0, online supplementary table S14). Specifically, primary (cholate) and conjugated forms of bile acids (taurocholate and glycocholate) were more abundant in the control group, whereas the secondary form (deoxycholic acid (DCA)) was significantly more abundant in the gastrectomy group (figure 4C and D). Twelve amino acids, including all branched-chain amino acids and two aromatic amino acids (Ile, Leu, Val, Tyr, Phe), were significantly enriched in the gastrectomy group. Metabolites’ association with the participants’ demographic parameters by MaAsLin showed that cholate enrichment in the control group might be affected by BMI, whereas phenyl-lactate and arginine enrichment might be affected by total cholesterol (online supplementary results and supplementary table S14).

Given the notably distinct microbiome composition between gastrectomy and control groups, we compared the topology of genus (figure 5A and B) and species (online supplementary figure S8) co-occurrence and co-excluding networks. In the genus network, the number of edges was higher in the control group (co-occurrence, 25; co-excluding, 15) compared with the gastrectomy group (co-occurrence, 9; co-excluding, 9). Although the edges do not necessarily represent ecological interactions (eg, mutualism, competition), the microbial network can show which organisms form the hub of community composition.34 Most close relationships (⍴>0.6) in the control group (eg, Coprobacillus, Eggerthella) did not appear or showed much lower values (0.2<⍴<0.4) in the gastrectomy group. In this group, Veillonella contributed to most connections (six genera), but co-excluded (⍴<−0.3) with four genera including Coprococcus (⍴=−0.569, p=4.00×10−4) and Odoribacter (⍴=−0.384, p=0.0160) (online supplementary table S10e). That might reflect the role of Veillonella as a network-hub in the gastrectomy group and its importance in microbial community alteration.34 Results were similar at species level, whereby co-occurrence networks were more abundant in the control (co-occurrence, 31; co-excluding, 8) compared with the gastrectomy group (co-occurrence, 25; co-excluding, 1). Several co-occurrence and co-excluding patterns were shared among genus-level and species-level networks (online supplementary results and supplementary figure S8).

Four (Leu, Ile, Ala, Val) out of nine amino acids formed a cluster and exhibited significant positive correlation with Atopobium, Veillonella and Streptococcus, which were mutually enriched in postgastrectomy patients. Streptococcus and Veillonella have been reported to ferment amino acids.35 We also observed the contribution of several gastrectomy-enriched species to amino acids synthesis (eg, Bacteroides fragilis) or degradation (eg, Akkermansia muciniphila) (online supplementary table S15). Accordingly, a gastrectomy-associated increase in the availability of amino acids might lead to more amino acid fermentators.

Gastrectomy followed by reconstruction of the GI tract radically alters oxygen availability, gut pH, food transit time, intestinal motility and hormonal conditions.36 37 We hereby show that gastrectomy for gastric cancer affects also the faecal microbiome and metabolome. Their links to physiological alterations are summarised as a schematic hypothesis (figure 6). Community PCoA highlighted species-level differences in microbiome composition and metabolite profiles between gastrectomy and control groups. The dissimilarity index within the gastrectomy group was significantly lower than in the control counterpart, demonstrating greater species similarity among postgastrectomy individuals (figure 1).

Our schematic hypothesis (figure 6) could be used as a framework for proof-of-concept studies that link the impact of microbiome alterations with patients’ outcome after gastrectomy. Our findings are in many ways consistent with results from other gastrectomy studies. We also identified several microbial functions and metabolites that might correlate with postsurgical metabolism. To determine if the microbiome is indeed involved in CRC occurrence following gastrectomy, further follow-up prospective studies are required. Our analysis also underlines the importance for gastrectomy patients to undergo intensified surveillance such as colonoscopy for early detection of possible metachronous CRC occurrence. To our knowledge, this is the first report on microbiome alterations using metagenomics and metabolomics data analysis after gastrectomy, especially total gastrectomy, for gastric cancer treatment. The present findings may be used to complement a non-invasive method for postsurgical prognosis assessment.
