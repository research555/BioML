The Gut Microbiome and Individual-Specific Responses to Diet

Nutritional content and timing are increasingly appreciated to constitute important human variables collectively impacting all aspects of human physiology and disease. However, person-specific mechanisms driving nutritional impacts on the human host remain incompletely understood, while current dietary recommendations remain empirical and nonpersonalized. Precision nutrition aims to harness individualized bodies of data, including the human gut microbiome, in predicting person-specific physiological responses (such as glycemic responses) to food. With these advances notwithstanding, many unknowns remain, including the long-term efficacy of such interventions in delaying or reversing human metabolic disease, mechanisms driving these dietary effects, and the extent of the contribution of the gut microbiome to these processes. We summarize these conceptual advances, while highlighting challenges and means of addressing them in the next decade of study of precision medicine, toward generation of insights that may help to evolve precision nutrition as an effective future tool in a variety of “multifactorial” human disorders.

Mammalian digestion is initiated by cognitive food perception, which stimulates the production of oral saliva and gastric secretions (1). Later on, the passage of a food bolus through the esophagus and stomach further stimulates the secretion of biliary and pancreatic secretions that play a fundamental role in food decomposition and digestion. Absorption of dietary nutrients takes place mainly in the small intestine, where structures called villi and microvilli greatly increase the mucosal surface area, thereby enhancing its absorptive capacity. Residues of food that was not absorbed in the small intestine reach the colon, in which absorption of water takes place, further solidifying stools. The proximal part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is loosely inhabited by microbes because of low pH, the presence of toxic bile acids, and high oxygen content (2). The GI tract gradually becomes more densely colonized by microbes distally. Depletion of dietary nutrients, such as fatty acids and carbohydrates in the intestinal lumen during the transit of food across the GI tract, renders the growth of many gut commensals dependent on nondietary host-derived energy sources by deconjugation of primary bile acids or degradation of mucin-derived glycans (3,–7).

The gut microbiome is strongly influenced by the composition (8,–10), amount, and timing (11,–18) of its host’s diet. Mounting evidence suggests that the timing of feeding has a predominant effect on downstream metabolic and immune functions in microbiome-dependent and -independent manners. In a given person, substantial variability was noticed when identical meals were consumed at different times of the day (19). The intestinal microbiome exhibits diurnal oscillations that are driven by feeding patterns (15, 17, 18). Circadian-clock perturbation (commonly termed “jet lag”) induces a dysbiosis that is associated with glucose intolerance and obesity that are transferable by fecal microbial transfer (FMT) (15, 18). The transcriptomic landscape of nonintestinal organs was shown to oscillate as a function of feeding timing, which is (at least partially) regulated by corresponding oscillations in gut-derived serum metabolites (14, 18). An irregular feeding pattern may result in impairments of fundamental physiological functions, such as hepatic detoxification. The peculiar propensity of the gut microbiome to adapt to dietary perturbation is mirrored by the speed at which this adaptation takes place (20,–24). Dietary constituents may support or impede the growth of particular microbes and also contain foodborne microbes, directly contributing to the net composition of the microbial genetic pool in the gut (9). Other dietary elements act as “immunomodulators” and can indirectly affect the microbiome composition in an immune-dependent manner via regulation of cellular and secreted immune effectors (25,–28).

Host-microbiome metabolic interactions are bidirectional. Intestinal motility is regulated by bacterial metabolism of bile acids and bacterially induced nitric oxide production in a diet-dependent manner (Fig. 1) (29,–32). Food choices are hypothesized by some to be subjected to microbiome influences, although evidence supporting that notion remains scarce (33,–35). Postdieting weight recidivism, a common complication in nutritional clinical practice, is modulated by a persistent diet-altered microbiome “memory” (36), at least in rodent models. Adiposity and weight gain in various mammals can be modified with microbiome manipulation and were hypothesized to be governed by the gut microbiomes’ capacity to extract energy from diet (37,–40). Promotion of weight gain is commonly achieved in livestock by antibiotic treatment (41, 42), a practice that is futile in germfree (GF) poultry (43), suggesting that microbiome manipulation by antibiotics may enhance dietary energy extraction. In healthy individuals, a short course of oral vancomycin (an antibiotic agent that is not absorbed systemically and therefore affects only the gut) attenuated dietary energy harvest compared with that after administration of a placebo, as mirrored by stool calorie loss (44). Interestingly, GF mice were previously reported to be resilient to deleterious effects of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, such as weight gain and glucose intolerance (45, 46); however, findings from recent studies using various types of HFDs suggest that vivarium-dependent factors may differentially induce this trait (47,–52).

Dietary fibers, also termed “glycans” or “polysaccharides,” are mainly plant-derived complex polymers of covalently linked simple carbohydrates (5). Humans are virtually devoid of enzymes that can decompose fibers, whereas gut bacteria express thousands of genes that encode carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (53). The products of primary and secondary fiber degradation are utilized by other members of the gut microbiome and the host in a convoluted web of cross-feeding (5, 6, 54, 55). A combination of person-specific fiber degradation capacity and the given fiber most probably determines the effects of fiber on host metabolism and the microbiome; however, in general, an increased intake of dietary fibers is associated with a higher overall microbial diversity, dominated by enrichment of Bacteroidetes and Prevotella spp. (20, 21, 56,–58), and coupled to favorable metabolic and immunologic effects, such as improved insulin resistance and lower susceptibility to infection and malignancy (59, 60). Inversely, fiber deprivation leads to decreased microbial diversity, lower colonic bacterial butyrate production, barrier dysfunction, and susceptibility to perturbation and infection (21, 61,–67). There is a notable interpersonal variability in complex and simple-carbohydrate digestion that is believed to be microbiome mediated and has been the subject of extensive research (as described in the next section) (59, 68,–70).

Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats have all been shown to interact with the gut microbiome. Western diets that are rich in fat induce weight gain and insulin resistance by impairing intestinal barrier function and propagating a Toll-like receptor 4-mediated inflammatory response that is termed “metabolic endotoxemia” (51, 71,–81). The resulting deleterious effects can be diminished by treatment with antibiotics (82) or phenocopied to another host by fecal microbial transfer (37). Proteins are metabolized by gut microbes into small metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), neurotransmitters, and organic acids, that have physiological effects both locally and systemically (83,–87). A plethora of widely consumed dietary and nondietary constituents, such as emulsifiers (88,–90), nonnutritive sweeteners (91,–96), trehalose (97), probiotics (98,–101), omega-3 fatty acids (102), and medications (103,–105), were shown to feature considerable microbiome-mediated health impacts and are a subject of intensive research that is beyond the scope of this review.

The intestinal microbiome generates downstream systemic signals, many of which are diet derived (106). One prominent example is the ketogenic diet, which aims at biochemically replacing carbohydrates with fat as a primary energy source through consumption of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. This diet is commonly used in clinical practice to reduce seizure frequency in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy and is known to induce considerable microbiome and immune alterations; however, its mechanism of action remains unknown (107, 108). A recent study demonstrated that the ketogenic diet lacks an antiseizure effect in microbiome-depleted mice (either GF or antibiotic-treated mice) and that a fecal microbiome transfer from mice fed a ketogenic diet into mice fed a control diet induced a seizure-protective effect (109). A reduced amino acid gamma-glutamylation capacity of the ketogenic diet-associated microbiome was shown to elevate the seizure threshold in that mouse model of epilepsy. Collectively, evidence in support of an intensive cross talk between the gut microbiome and host nutrition, which may impact a variety of physiological and pathophysiological traits, is accumulating.

Dietary habits constitute a strong driver of interpersonal variance in the gut microbiome composition, and its influence prevails over that of genetics by most estimates (23, 110,–112). One example of person-specific microbiome impact on dietary physiological responses to consumed food focused on artificial sweeteners, mainly saccharin, and demonstrated that glycemic responses to these seemingly inert food supplements were driven by variations in the human microbiome (95). Moreover, adverse glycemic responses to saccharin could be predicted using machine learning by utilizing microbiome data collected before sweetener exposure (95). Indeed, a longitudinal concurrent daily dietary log and stool metagenomic sequencing throughout 17 consecutive days for 34 healthy individuals recently revealed markedly person-specific diet-microbiome interactions (113). Whereas some aspects of optimal nutrition unanimously apply, most are person specific and may differ in a population based on genetic and environmental factors. Within the environmental component, the gut microbiome accounts for some variation in subject-specific responses to diets, as do the timing of meals, time between meals, level of physical activity, and multiple other individualized features.

The recent PREDICT1 study assessed subject-specific postprandial metabolic responses (19). Unlike the PNP, PREDICT1 also predicted postprandial triglyceride (TG) levels and insulin responses in addition to glucose. Furthermore, it included 230 twin pairs with genomic data that allowed the investigator to estimate the contribution of inheritance to postprandial metabolic responses. As with the PNP, clinical and metabolic parameters as well as microbiome and CGM data were collected from 1,002 healthy individuals (and from an additional 100 individuals in the validation cohort). Genetics accounted for 48%, 9%, and 0% of the variability in postprandial glucose, insulin, and triglycerides, respectively, whereas the stool microbiome accounted for only 6.4%, 5.8%, and 7.5% of postprandial variability in blood glucose, insulin, and TG, respectively. A meal’s macronutrient composition and timing in relation to previous meal/sleep/exercise are well-established effectors of PPGR and were also shown in the PREDICT1 study to surpass the microbiome in their PPGR predictive power. Notably, the predictive algorithm developed in the PREDICT1 study reached an accuracy in PPGR prediction similar to that of the PNP (Pearson’s correlation coefficients [r] were 0.7 and 0.77 between predicted and measured PPGRs, respectively) despite the different inputs and machine-learning approaches used. Prediction of postprandial TG and insulin in the PREDICT1 study were less accurate. In summary, both the PNP and PREDICT1 studies provide good-quality evidence that dietary recommendations can be optimized to be patient tailored.

With these major advances in understanding the contribution of the microbiome to precision nutrition notwithstanding, many challenges need to be addressed in order to increase our mechanistic understanding of the forces shaping individualized human responses to food and the role that the microbiome plays in this complex and poorly understood process.

While machine learning provides valuable insights into features possibly contributing to these physiological outcomes, their mechanistic elucidation merits further molecular-level research. Equally elusive are the potential roles of the viral, fungal, and parasitic microbiomes in contributing to personalized human responses to food, as well as roles played by niche-specific microbiomes along the oral and gastrointestinal regions. Additionally, better annotations of microbial reads currently constituting “dark matter” may enable us to refine and improve the utility of the microbiome, when coupled with other clinical features, in predicting food-induced human responses. Finally, as nutrition is estimated to impact a plethora of infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, and even neurodegenerative processes, understanding of the causative food-induced and microbiome-modulated effects induced in the human host under these contexts may enable us to rationally harness precision nutrition as part of the therapeutic arsenal in these common and often devastating human diseases.
