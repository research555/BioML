Emerging Evidence of the Gut Microbiome in Chemotherapy: A Clinical Review

Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiome is associated with both cancer chemotherapy (CTX) outcomes and adverse events (AEs). This review examines the relationship between the gut microbiome and CTX as well as the impact of CTX on the gut microbiome. A literature search was conducted in electronic databases Medline, PubMed and ScienceDirect, with searches for “cancer” and “chemotherapy” and “microbiome/microbiota”. The relevant literature was selected for use in this article. Seventeen studies were selected on participants with colorectal cancer (CRC; n=5), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML; n=3), Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (n=2), breast cancer (BCa; n=1), lung cancer (n=1), ovarian cancer (n=1), liver cancer (n=1), and various other types of cancers (n=3). Seven studies assessed the relationship between the gut microbiome and CTX with faecal samples collected prior to (n=3) and following CTX (n=4) showing that the gut microbiome is associated with both CTX efficacy and toxicity. Ten other prospective studies assessed the impact of CTX during treatment and found that CTX modulates the gut microbiome of people with cancer and that dysbiosis induced by the CTX is related to AEs. CTX adversely impacts the gut microbiome, inducing dysbiosis and is associated with CTX outcomes and AEs. Current evidence provides insights into the gut microbiome for clinicians, cancer survivors and the general public. More research is required to better understand and modify the impact of CTX on the gut microbiome.

Chemotherapy (CTX), systemic cancer treatment involving cytotoxic drugs, has significantly improved the overall survival of people with cancer (1). However, the main drawback of CTX are adverse events (AEs) related to treatment, which impact on both the physical and psychological well-being of patients. Up to 87% of people experienced at least one AE during and after CTX (2, 3), although recent advancements in CTX have achieved more tolerable and safer outcomes. Common AEs are nausea and vomiting, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, mucositis, CTX-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), fatigue, hot flushes, anxiety and depression, insomnia and cognitive impairment. CTX also has the effect of suppressing immune responses and increasing the incidence of infection and subsequent morbidity and mortality (4).

To date, few studies have examined the impact of CTX on the gut microbiome of cancer survivors in relation to CTX-induced AEs. Most of the previous reviews have included both preclinical and clinical studies and attempted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of dysbiosis of gut microbiota in cancer pathogenesis but did not examine relationships between CTX-related AEs and the gut microbiome during and after treatment. Hence, our current review assesses the impact of CTX on the gut microbiome and CTX-related AEs in cancer patients and provides meaningful information for clinicians, patients, caregivers and the general public.

A literature search was conducted using the electronic databases Medline, PubMed and ScienceDirect, with the main search terms including “cancer” and “chemotherapy” and “microbiome/microbiota”. Inclusion criteria in the searches were: clinical trials conducted with adults (> 18 years) and published in English. References contained in the included studies were carefully reviewed for relevant papers that may have been missed by electronic searches. The search strategy was performed for studies published up to November 2020.

Seventeen studies were identified from the three electronic databases (Medline, PubMed and ScienceDirect) and included in this review (Table 1).

Definition of terms used in microbiota research.

α-diversity: Number and evenness of distribution of taxa within a given sample.

β-diversity: The difference in diversity of taxa from one sample to another, i.e., the number of taxa that are not the same (or not similarly distributed) in two different samples.

16S rRNA gene: Marker gene for bacterial identification, containing evolutionary conserved universal as well as variable regions.

Operational taxonomic unit (OTU): Cluster of nearly-identical sequences (e.g., 97% similarity), often used in microbiota research instead of ‘species’.

16S rRNA gene sequencing: Sequencing of the 16S rRNA marker gene.

Metagenomic sequencing: Sequencing of the entire metagenome (all the genetic material in a sample), also allowing analysis of the functional capacity of the microbiome.

The seventeen selected studies included a total of 742 patients with a range of 8 – 126 participants in each of the studies. Cancers studied included CRC (n=5) (26, 29, 38, 39), AML (n=3) (28, 30, 31), BCa (n=2) (24, 36), Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (n=2) (32, 33), lung cancer (n=1) (23), ovarian cancer (n=1) (27), liver cancer (n=1) (25), and various other types of cancers (n=3) (24, 34, 35). Six studies were conducted in China (23, 26, 27, 29, 38, 39), three in the USA (28, 30, 31), two in France (32, 33), two in Japan (25, 36), and one each in Austria (35), Australia (34) and Israel (24). Total CTX dosage, type of CTX drugs and periods of CTX interventions varied across studies. Study designs and the primary outcomes of individual studies included in this review were diverse.

Fifteen studies analysed the gut microbiome profile with the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S-rRNA) gene sequencing method, two with metagenomic sequencing (23, 24), one study with quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT/PCR) (34) and another study with qPCR and Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (35). Interestingly, analysis of gene sequencing regions of 16S rRNA varied across studies: V3-V4 (n=3) (25, 36, 38), V4 (n=4) (26, 28, 30, 31), V4-V5 (n=5) (27–29, 32, 39), V5-V6 (n=1) (33), qRT/PRC (n=1) (34), and qPCR/PCR-DGGE (n=1) (35).

Three studies assessed the relationship between baseline composition and diversity of the gut microbiome and CTX outcomes (23–25). Two studies reported that the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome was related to the efficacy of CTX (23, 25) and one study found that the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome was related to weight gain (24).

Another study compared the composition of gut bacteria in four groups, viz. healthy controls (n=33) vs patients diagnosed with CRC (n=17) vs patients with CRC plus surgery (n=5) vs patients with CRC plus CTX (n=14) (39). This study reported that, at the genus level, Veillonella and species Veillonella dispar were observed in CRC patients treated with CTX, but not in the other three groups. In addition, although not detected at the genus level, two other species, Prevotella copri and Bacteroides plebeius, were enriched in CRC patients treated with CTX (39), whereas alpha diversity of the gut microbiome was lower in CRC patients who received surgery, compared to the other three groups.

Ten studies examined the effect of CTX on the gut microbiome in patients receiving CTX; three with AML, two each with CRC, Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a mixed group of cancers, and one with ovarian cancer patients.

Two studies conducted in CRC patients reported changes in the gut microbiome pre and post CTX (26, 29). One study examined the effects of three palliative CTX regimens (FOLFIRI (n=11) vs FOLFIRI regimen plus cetuximab (n=4) vs XELOX regimen (n=15)) on the gut microbiome and found that impacts on the gut microbiome varied according to the CTX regime administered (26). Namely, this study reported that the relative proportions of Faecalibacterium, Clostridiales, phascolarctobacterium, Humicola and Rhodotorula were decreased, and the abundances of Candida, Magnusiomyces, Tremellomycetes, Dipodascaceae, Saccharomycetales, Malassezia and Lentinula were increased in advanced CRC patients treated with the FOLFIRI regimen. In comparison with those treated with the FOLFIRI regimen alone the proportion of Humicola, Rhodotorula, and Magnusiomyces were decreased in advanced CRC patients treated with the FOLFIRI regimen combined with cetuximab, whilst those of Candida, Tremellomycetes, Dipodascaceae, Saccharomycetales, Malassezia and Lentinula were increased. The abundances of Veillonella, Humicola, Tremellomycetes and Malassezia were increased in postoperative CRC patients treated with the XELOX regimen. Another study conducted with CRC patients in stage II-IV (n=43) collected faecal sample five times after each treatment cycle and reported an increased ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Bilophila Comamonas, Collinsella, Butyricimonas, Eggerthella and Anaerostipes, and decreased Morganella, Pyramidobacter, Proteus, and Escherichia-Shigella after CTX (29).

Three studies assessed the predictive value of the gut microbiome and its relationship to infection risk in patients with AML (28, 30, 31). Although these studies were conducted by the same research team, it was reported that the associations between the relative abundance of the gut microbiome and risk of infection varied across studies, while associations between risk of infection and alpha diversity of the gut microbiome was consistent in two studies (28, 31). One study (n=34) reported that lower alpha diversity and enriched Stenotrophomonas prior to CTX was associated with risk of infection in patients with AML (31). They also reported decreased alpha-diversity and decreased Blautia, Prevotella, Leptotrichia of the microbiome but increased Lactobacillus at the genus level during and after CTX. A subsequent study conducted with AML patients (n= 55) reported that increased intra-patient temporal variability of alpha-diversity and enriched Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Akkermansia, Subdilogranulum, and Pseudobutyrivibrio were associated with risk of infection (30). The third study conducted with a large sample size (n=97) reported that, at baseline, higher alpha-diversity (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI],.18–.74) and relative abundance of Porphyromonadaceae (HR, 0.36; 95% CI,.18–.73) were associated with an increased probability of remaining infection-free during neutropenia (28). This study reported that the use of antibiotics (carbapenem >72 hours) increased the risk of infection in addition to lowering alpha-diversity and a relative low abundance of Clostridiales, Ruminococcaceae and Porphyromonadaceae.

Two studies examined the impact of CTX on the gut microbiome in patients undergoing one course of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) conditioning CTX and found that CTX changed the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome (32, 33).

An earlier study conducted with a small sample size (n=8) reported a significant reduction in alpha diversity and alterations in the composition of the gut microbiome associated with GI toxicities, viz. decreased Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium and increased Bacteroides, Proteobacteria and Escherichia (33). A subsequent study by the same researchers compared the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome with faecal samples from patients (n=28) before and after CTX (32). They reported, at genus level, significant decreases in the abundance of Ruminococcus, Oscillospira, Blautia, Lachnospira, Roseburia, Dorea, Coprococcus, Anaerostipes, Clostridium, Collin- sella, Adlercreutzia and Bifidobacterium.

One study assessed changes in the gut microbiome of ovarian cancer patients pre and post-surgery compared with surgery plus CTX (27). This study found significant decreases in the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and increases in the abundance of Proteobacteria after surgery. Interestingly, a comparison of pre and post CTX following surgery found the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes increased, and the abundance of Proteobacteria decreased after CTX.

Furthermore, some forms of anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides, Collinsella and Blautia significantly increased after CTX.

Two earlier studies explored the effects of CTX on gut bacteria in people diagnosed with various cancers (34, 35). One study examined the effect of gut bacteria related to CTX-induced diarrhea (CID) (34). They compared the gut bacteria of cancer patients with CID and a healthy control group and found decreased Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp. and Enterococcus spp. and increased Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus spp. in patients with CID (34).

Another similar study compared differences between patients after CTX and a healthy group, and found decreased diversity and Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa, Bacteroides, Bifidobacteria, Clostridium cluster IV in patients after CTX (35). In addition, this study investigated the differences in gut bacteria between patients who received CTX with antibiotics and those without and found an abundance of Clostridium difficile in patients treated with antibiotics. In these two studies, faecal samples were analysed using conventional culture techniques and qRT-PCR, while other studies included in this review were analysed using next generation sequencing (NGS), and advanced technology including 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomics.

Four studies examined the relationship between the gut microbiome and cancer survivorship in patients who had received CTX (36–39). Faecal samples were collected at the follow-up visit after CTX and examined the relationship between the gut microbiome and post CTX-related AEs. Two studies examined the effects of CTX on the gut microbiome (low dose vs traditional dose of CTX and PFS (37), surgery vs surgery plus CTX) (39), and two other studies assessed the relationship between CID (38) and fear of recurrence (36) after CTX.

An earlier study explored the association between the gut microbiome and CID (completed 8 cycles of the CapeOX regimen: capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily) combined with oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) in patients diagnosed with stage III CRC. This study found that the gut microbial community richness and diversity were lower after CTX in CID (p < 0.05) compared to a control group (38). It also reported that, at the species level, there were significant differences in 75 micro-organisms between the CRC with and without CID and identified that Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most predominant species among the gut microbiome in patients with CID.

A recent study examined the effect of CTX (low doses of metronomic capecitabine (n=15) vs conventional doses (n=16)) on the gut microbiome in women diagnosed with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and found that beta diversity (unweighted-unifrac index) was significantly lower in the metronomic group compared to the group who received conventional doses (p=0.025) (37). Furthermore, they found that the median PFS was significantly shorter in patients with the gut bacteria composition of Slackia (9.2 vs. 32.7 months, P = 0.004), while the patients with Blautia obeum had a significantly prolonged PFS compared to those without (32.7 vs. 12.9 months, P = 0.013). At the phylum level, the main composition of Cyanobacteria was significantly lower in the metronomic group, while the phyla of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were similar between the groups. In addition, at the genus level, Megamonas and f_Mogibacteriaceae were significantly enriched and Blautia and o_Streptophyta were depleted in the metronomic group.

A recent study examined the relationship between the gut microbiota and FCR in women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer with a history of CTX (n=57) and those with no history of CTX (n=60) (36). Interestingly, this study found that in women with a history of CTX and FCR, lower alpha diversity, lower relative abundance of the Firmicutes (p=0.03) and higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (p=0.04) at the phylum level, and higher relative abundance of Bacteroides (p<0.01) and lower relative abundance of Lachinospitaceae (p=0.03) and Ruminococcus (p=0.02) at the genus level, were associated with FCR while there was no significant association in women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer with no history of CTX.

One study compared the composition of gut bacteria in four groups, viz., healthy controls (n=33) vs patients diagnosed with CRC (n=17) vs patients with CRC plus surgery (n=5) vs patients with CRC plus CTX (n=14) (39). This study reported that, at the genus level, Veillonella and species Veillonella dispar were only found in CRC patients treated with CTX but not in the other three groups. In addition, although not detected at the genus level, two other species, Prevotella copri and Bacteroides plebeius, were enriched in CRC patients treated with CTX, whereas alpha diversity of the gut microbiome was lower in CRC patients who received surgery compared to the other three groups.

Often prospective studies, seven studies collected data about use of antibiotics in participants. Three studies conducted with AML (28, 30, 31) and two studies with Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (32, 33) received antibiotics as prophylaxis prior and during CTX, one study each received antibiotics before chemotherapy and during CTX (34, 35). One study examined the difference between CTX with antibiotics versus CTX with no antibiotics and showed decreased diversity of Clostridium cluster IV and XIVa in response to CTX with cluster IV diversity being particularly affected by antibiotics (35).

Of the seven studies that examined the relationship, two studies excluded antibiotic users during recruitment (23, 38), one study included participants using antibiotics before but not during CTX (24), whereas, another study included participants using antibiotics before and during CTX (25).

The significance of the current review is that we not only assessed literature examining the relationship between the gut microbiome and CTX outcomes and AEs, but also the impact of CTX on the gut microbiome during treatment. Previous reviews examined the association between the gut microbiome and cancer survivors using limited clinical trials and attempted to elucidate the mechanisms of pathogenesis of cancer with preclinical studies (40, 41). Of seventeen studies reviewed, we found that three studies assessed the relationship between the gut microbiome and CTX outcomes (respondent vs non respondent, PFS, OS and weight gain) with faecal samples collected prior to CTX (23–25), whereas four other studies assessed the relationship between the gut microbiome and CTX outcomes (diarrhea, FCR, low dosage vs conventional dosage, surgery vs surgery plus CTX) with faecal samples collected either after CTX or in patients with a history of CTX (36) (37–39). In addition to evaluating these relationships, in ten other prospective studies, faecal samples were collected multiple times during CTX, and examined the impact of CTX on the gut microbiome which provided valuable insight into the importance of the gut microbiome in cancer survivors (26–35). The findings of the current review regarding the association between the gut microbiome and CTX-related AEs and treatment outcomes are consistent with previous reviews (19, 40, 41). Several studies reported consistent relationships between dysbiosis of the microbiome and CTX-related AEs and suggested that the gut microbiome has the potential to be applied as a biomarker to predict CTX outcomes and related AEs (40, 41). However, associations do not represent causation and further well-designed studies are required, such as a recent high quality clinical trial that is being undertaken in Canada exploring the effect of CTX on the gut microbiome (42). In recognition of weaknesses in the evidence from cohort studies, we examined causal links between the gut microbiome and CTX in ten prospective studies. A review of these ten studies assessed the impact of CTX on the gut microbiome during CTX and indicated that CTX modulated the gut microbiome, and that this modulatory effect is associated with an increased risk of infection and impacts on the efficacy of CTX. The ten prospective studies demonstrated the vital role of the gut microbiome in CTX and suggests that the modulation of the gut microbiome during CTX may reduce the risk of AEs and increase the efficacy of CTX. This hypothesis was partially supported by previous studies conducted with lifestyle interventions including prebiotics and exercise although there were some discrepancies among the studies (43–45).

Considering these limitations, future studies with larger sample sizes and robust study designs are required to provide evidence that can readily translate into the clinical setting. To our knowledge, the current comprehensive literature review is the first to examine causal relationships of the gut microbiome on CTX outcomes and AEs with prospective clinical trials, and to assess the relationship between the gut microbiome and CTX outcomes and CTX-related AEs with observational studies. In conclusion, although there is a lack of high quality clinical trials on this topic, our results from a comprehensive review provides further insight into the complex relationships between the gut microbiome and CTX and shows the potential for future research to improve patient care. The current evidence suggests the potential implications for the gut microbiome to predict CTX outcome and prevent AEs in patients undergoing CTX, however, several challenges remain and need to be resolved before recommending microbiome therapy in oncology.
