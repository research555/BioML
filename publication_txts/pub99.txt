Implication of gut microbiome in immunotherapy for colorectal cancer



Colorectal cancer (CRC) constitutes the third most frequently reported malignancy in the male population and the second most common in women in the last two decades. Colon carcinogenesis is a complex, multifactorial event, resulting from genetic and epigenetic aberrations, the impact of environmental factors, as well as the disturbance of the gut microbial ecosystem. The relationship between the intestinal microbiome and carcinogenesis was relatively undervalued in the last decade. However, its remarkable effect on metabolic and immune functions on the host has been in the spotlight as of recent years. There is a strong relationship between gut microbiome dysbiosis, bowel pathogenicity and responsiveness to anti-cancer treatment; including immunotherapy. Modifications of bacteriome consistency are closely associated with the immunologic response to immunotherapeutic agents. This condition that implies the necessity of gut microbiome manipulation. Thus, creatingan optimal response for CRC patients to immunotherapeutic agents. In this paper, we will review the current literature observing how gut microbiota influence the response of immunotherapy on CRC patients.

Core Tip: Colorectal cancer (CRC) constitutes the third most frequent malignancy. CRC is a complex, multistep process. The impact of environmental factors as well as the disturbance of the gut microbial ecosystem is associated with CRC development. There is a strong relationship between the gut microbiome and resistance to immunotherapy.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) constitutes the third most frequently reported malignancy in the male population and the second most common in women in the last several decades, based off GLOBACAN epidemiological data[1]. Colon carcinogenesis is a complex, multifactorial event composed of genetic and epigenetic aberrations, which additionally causes the disturbance of gut homeostasis resulting from gut microbiota modifications[2]. The microbiome constitutes a multiplex ecosystem of microorganisms located in the gastrointestinal tract of many species, including humans[3].

The relationship between the intestinal microbiome and disease development, including carcinogenesis, was relatively undervalued in the last decade. However, the interrelation of gut microbiota with the main functions of the host has recently been in the spotlight[4]. The digestive tract contains the largest amount of microbiota colonization among other anatomical regions, accounting for approximately 70% of the human microbiota make-up[5], including viral and bacterial microorganisms, archaea and fungi[6,7]. The proximal parts of the GI tract, including the stomach and small intestine, present few microbiota species whereas the distal part, the colon, presents the largest number of species (microorganisms) in the colonic substance[7]. The six main phyla of the gut microbiome (90% of the population) include[8]: Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Euryachaeota[9]. Of all the genera found in the human gut, Bacteroides makes up the majority of the population (30%)[10], implying its significant effecton the human functional system. Additionally, many genera from the Firmicutes phylum compose a high amount of the intestinal substance, such as lactobacillus, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium and Ruminococcus[11]. The application of metagenomics on fecal specimens has given the opportunity for microbiome quantification and analysis, and potentially its use as a potent diagnostic tool[12].

PubMed was searched to identify studies on gut microbiome, immunotherapy and CRC.

Finally, the authors similarly reviewed the reference lists of eligible articles to identify further eligible articles, books and other forms of publication. Publications that are written in any other language other than English were excluded. Publications of abstracts were also excluded.

Gut microbiota exhibits diverse functions in the human organism and are responsible for many metabolic processes and biosynthesis. Vitamin synthesis constitutes one of the key roles of gut microbiota, such as riboflavin, vitamin B1, biotin, vitamin K and cobalamin[13]. They also have a crucial role in non-digestible carbohydrate metabolism; to transform them into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyric acid, acetic acid and propionic[14], which are produced by the main phyla of bacteriome, this includes Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes[15]. Alteration of the above metabolic process leads to modification of the fatty acid production and overall metabolic imbalance[16]. Along with their involvement in vitamin and short fatty acids synthesis, they take part in bile acid production[17]. Neuromodulators are also produced by gut microbiota, with a significant implication for the gut-brain axis, which includes the peripheral and central nervous systems as well as the enteric nervous system[18]. Many neurological and psychiatric disorders are closely connected with the gut microbiome. This can occur because they are responsible for synthesizing many pro-inflammatory cytokines, amyloids and liposaccharides[18]. Based on metagenomics, genome disturbance and dysbiotic flora can cause a predisposition to develop a number of malignancies[19], including non-neoplastic disorders, such as atopy, functional intestinal disturbances, like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and metabolic syndrome[20,21].

This therapeutic modality is currently selected as an anti-cancer treatment specifically in cases of tumors that are characterized by high microsatellite instability (MSI-H)[32]. Tumors that present MSI-H arise from a defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism that leads to the accumulation of genetic mutations. This can be seen in the case of mutant MSH2, PMS2, MSH6 and MLH1. Or by epigenetic aberration, such as genome hyper-methylation[33]. There are many reports that gut microbiota influences the response to anti-cancer treatment including immunotherapy[34]. It is observed that a significant number of CRC patients that lacked a specific taxa in their bacteriome, presented a limited response to immunotherapy agents such as anti-PD1.This condition implies the use for more personalized anti-cancer treatments that can prove to be potent. In this paper, we review the current literature on how gut microbiota influences the response of CRC patients to immunotherapy[35].

There are many studies about the implication of gut microbiota in immunotherapeutic agents including immune checkpoint inhibitors for melanoma. Fewer studies exist about its role in CRC treatment management.

Recruitment of T lymphocytes is observed in CRC malignant tissues[53] via the secretion of chemotactic cytokines. This is further related to an abundance in proteobacteria Ruminococcaceae, B. fragilis and E.coli. Alternatively, a high number of Fusobacteriais is associated with a dismal prognosis. In in vitro it has been observed to express an increased number of recruited T cells and inflammatory modulators [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1][54], an inhibitory effect on Natural killer cells, as well as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes[55]. Although Fusobacterium nucleatum is normally associated with a worse prognosis, it constitutes a promoter for differentiation in regulatory T cells leading to a decrease in expression of scurfin or forkheadbox P3 which is correlated to prolonged survival[56].

The therapeutic management of CRC is considered quite challenging due to the complex molecular basis including genetic and epigenetic alterations[57]. In recent years, immunotherapeutic agents are utilized for tumors that present high MSI-H which results from a defective DNA MMR or epigenetic modification[33]. An epigenetic aberration is genome hyper-methylation in addition tomutant genes such as PMS2, MLH1 as well as MSH2 and MSH6[58]. In the case of MSI-H colorectal tumors, there is evident methylation of CpG islands in the promoter of the BRAF proto-oncogene[59]. It is observed that patients with BRAF and RAS genetic mutations present resistance to immunotherapeutic treatments with a limited enhancement of survival[60]. It can occur in cases of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, like cetuximab, as well as Panitumumab[61]. In comparison with MSI tumors, the microsatellite stable tumors present a more aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis[62]. Immunotherapeutic agents, such as pembrolizumab are commonly used in cases of chemo-resistant advanced colorectal malignant tumors despite the existence or lack of either MMR or MSI-H based off the KEYNOTE 028 clinical trial[63]. For tumors with MMR phenotype, the utilization of nivolumab alone or with ipilimumab is highly recommended[47]. The administration of cancer vaccines in CRC is still under study and it is limited solely to cases of end-stage CRC[64]. Talimogene laherparepvec vaccine uses Herpes virus type-1 as a vector which targets the GM-CSF gene. The combination of systemic use of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 immunotherapeutic agent) with the above vaccine is currently under assessment for tumors with microsatellite stability[63] or as a monotherapy in secondary liver cancer[65].

Tumor microenvironment (TME) includes multiple types of cells, such as fibroblasts, immune cells, endothelial and stromal cells[66]. TME demonstrates a significant role in immune responses, particularly in CRC, and constitutes as a therapeutic target for many anti-cancer agents[67]. The stroma around the tumor has a key role in resistance to chemotherapy due to the fact that it includes a heterogeneous population of cells with various levels of differentiation. This contributes to invasive tumor behavior and dissemination. This is shown in the case of tumor-associated macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Both of these are related to a dismal prognosis and neoangiogenesis[68,69], as well as Myeloid-derived suppressor cells which are also implicated in tumor progression and invasion. Their effect is under the regulation of tumoral products like chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 and 5 (CCL2 and CCL5)[70].

It was previously stated that the gut microbiota exhibited various effects on the differentiation mechanism and tumor development. While they influence the tumor response to immunotherapeutics[71], the existence of intra-tumoral bacteria is reported in many solid tumors, especially in breast cancer. It was demonstrated that the microbiome is particular for each kind of malignant tumor presenting distinct metabolic functions[72]. Based on data that was collected by whole-transcriptome analysis, there is a distinct microbiome correlated with different malignant tumors, implying a specific microbial profile for each type of cancer[73]. Additionally, TME has a crucial role in the existence and multiplication of intra-tumoral bacteria[74]. Many studies illustrate the close relationship between immunotherapy and gut microbiota, and their implication in the anti-tumor mechanism such as immune-checkpoint inhibitors[72].

Resistance to immunotherapy is difficult to overcome in clinical practice[31]. Manipulation of gut microbiota constitutes a promising method for reducing the resistance to therapeutic agents. This is implied by the notable effect of intestinal microbial products on the malignant tumor where they could also be considered cancer-driving molecules[75].

Based on various human and animal-model cohort studies, intestinal microbiota could not only have been beneficial but also toxic effects on immune checkpoint inhibition[78]. Reduced toxicity was observed in specimens where Bacteroidetes genera were in abundance. Although they relate to unresponsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), in contrast to Firmicutes, and especially in the case of Ruminococaceae, they were not only responsive to ICIs but also presented toxic effects. In cases of overgrown Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, patients had an increased risk of presenting colitis related with CTLA-4 inhibitors[79,80].

Based on all the characteristics of the intestinal microbiota, they can either promote the anti-neoplastic response or induce inflammation and carcinogenesis[81]. A reduced anti-cancer response in the host was observed in germ-free mice or with antibiotic administration (broad-spectrum)[28,35]. In cases with urinary tract malignancies and lung cancer, antibiotics had a harmful effect on anti-PD1/PD-L1 treatment[35] in comparison to cyclophosphamide which presented a promoting effect on the overgrowth of Barnesiella intestine hominis in the intestinal tract and a stimulatory effect on anti-cancer immune response[82].

Lastly, environmental and lifestyle habits could potentially alter the gut microbiome. These include physical exercise, proper dietary habits, sleep patterns, as well as via the utilization of FMT[84]. Bacteriotherapy or FMT includes the transferring of beneficial bacterial species such as Bacteroides, Bifidobacteria, E. hirae and Akkermansia mucini philia[85].

The relationship between the intestinal microbiome and disease development, such as carcinogenesis, was underestimated in the last decades. Nevertheless, the crucial role of intestinal microbiota has been in the spotlight as of recent years. Not only for their significant influence on the main metabolic functions of the host but also on the immune and anti-tumor responses. Immunotherapeutic agents are commonly used specifically for cases with chemo-resistant advanced colorectal malignant tumors. The implication of gut microbiota in the anti-cancer immune response is still under research. However, there are many reports supporting that the lack of specific bacterial taxa in CRC patients leads to a limited response to immunotherapy or complete unresponsiveness with the presence of specific phyla that could promote the anti-cancer response. Based on various human and animal-model cohort studies, intestinal microbiota could not only have beneficial effects on immune checkpoint inhibition but also have detrimental effects. The aforementioned phenomenon illustrates the necessity for the manipulation of intestinal microbiota. Specifically for the highest anti-neoplastic immune response, either via bacteriophage therapy or lifestyle habits modifications as well as FMT. Further research regarding the implication of gut microbiome on immunotherapy responses is needed for the identification of additional druggable targets, along with the manipulation of intestinal microbiota to achieve an optimal therapeutic response personalized for each patient.
