The Role of the Gut Microbiome in Pediatric Obesity and Bariatric Surgery

Obesity affects 42.4% of adults and 19.3% of children in the United States. Childhood obesity drives many comorbidities including hypertension, fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Prior research suggests that aberrant compositional development of the gut microbiome, with low-grade inflammation, precedes being overweight. Therefore, childhood may provide opportunities for interventions that shape the microbiome to mitigate obesity-related diseases. Children with obesity have gut microbiota compositional and functional differences, including increased proinflammatory bacterial taxa, compared to lean controls. Restoration of the gut microbiota to a healthy state may ameliorate conditions associated with obesity and help maintain a healthy weight. Pediatric bariatric (weight-loss) surgery is an effective treatment for childhood obesity; however, there is limited research into the role of the gut microbiome after weight-loss surgery in children. This review will discuss the magnitude of childhood obesity, the importance of the developing microbiome in establishing metabolic pathways, interventions such as bariatric surgery that may modulate the gut microbiome, and future directions for the potential development of microbiome-based therapeutics to treat obesity.

Childhood obesity is an epidemic in the United States; 19.3% of children have obesity and 6.1% have severe obesity [1]. Severe childhood obesity is associated with complications including hypertension, fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus [2,3]. If individuals can achieve weight loss prior to entering adulthood, the risk of these conditions is mitigated [4], making childhood obesity a key target area for intervention. Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery is highly effective in enabling weight loss and decreasing associated comorbidities, although the biological mechanisms underlying weight loss in bariatric surgery are not fully elucidated. The gut microbiota (community of microbes in the intestines) appears to provide bacterial control of metabolic processes that could impact energy regulation in obesity, but its role has not yet been determined following bariatric surgery in children. It is important to study the gut microbiota in children as the developing microbiome of a child differs from the microbiome of an adult and plays a clearer role in establishing metabolic pathways. This review aims to characterize the gut microbiome in healthy children, the role of gut microbiome dysbiosis in obesity, and to discuss strategies to modify disease-prone gut microbiota in children with severe obesity, including bariatric surgery.

Body mass index (BMI) is used as a screening tool for both childhood and adult obesity and is defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters [2]. A BMI of 18.5 kg/m2 to 24.9 kg/m2 is considered a normal or healthy weight [1]. In adults, overweight is defined as BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 with class 1 obesity defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, class 2 obesity BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2, and class 3 obesity BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2. Class 3 obesity is also termed severe obesity [2]. In contrast, a child’s body composition changes during growth from infancy into adulthood, with children growing at different rates at different times [1]. Therefore, for ages 2 through 19, weight status is calculated in comparison with other same-age and same-sex children using specific growth charts compiled by the Center For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [1]. For children less than 2 years of age, weight-for-length should be plotted using the World Health Organization (WHO) normative growth charts [5]. A normal or healthy weight is defined as the 5th percentile to less than the 85th percentile [1], with overweight defined as BMI ≥ 85th percentile, and class 1 obesity defined as BMI ≥ 95th percentile [2]. The adaptation of adult criteria for obesity unto children includes class 2 obesity (≥120% of the 95th percentile) and class 3 obesity (≥140% of the 95th percentile), with severe obesity generally describing a child’s BMI ≥ 120% of the 95th percentile [2].

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2017–2018 estimates that in adults, 30.7% are overweight, 42.4% have obesity, and 9.2% have severe obesity [1]. From the same survey, 16.1% of children and adolescents are overweight, 19.3% have obesity, and 6.1% have severe obesity [1]. Based on these numbers, the prevalence of childhood obesity doubled over the past 30 years [1,6]. Furthermore, weight gain among children and adolescents increased during the COVID-19 pandemic [7], highlighting a need for effective interventions that can be delivered remotely [8].

There are disparities among racial/ethnic groups in terms of obesity prevalence. Non-Hispanic Black women are the only adult population (by race/ethnicity and sex) with over half of the constituents having obesity, at 56.9% [1]. Obesity in adults is highest among non-Hispanic Blacks (49.6%), followed by Hispanics (44.8%), non-Hispanic Whites (42.4%), and non-Hispanic Asians (17.4%). Severe obesity in adults is highest among non-Hispanic Blacks (13.8%), followed by non-Hispanic Whites (9.3%), Hispanics (7.9%), and non-Hispanic Asians (2.0%) [1]. These disparities in obesity rates are also present in, and likely stem from, the pediatric population (Figure 1). Non-Hispanic Black girls are again the population (by race/ethnicity and sex) with the highest amount of obesity, at 29.1% [1]. Obesity in children is highest among non-Hispanic Blacks (24.2%), followed by Hispanics (22.8%), non-Hispanic Whites (16.1%), and non-Hispanic Asians (8.7%) [9]. Severe obesity in children is highest among non-Hispanic Blacks (10.2%), followed by Hispanics (5.3%), non-Hispanic Whites (4.3%), and non-Hispanic Asians (2.1%) [9].

Childhood obesity is linked to hypertension, fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, orthopedic disorders, and poor psychological health [2,3]. These same comorbidities are found in adults who have obesity [3]. The etiology of childhood obesity is multifactorial, including environmental, behavioral, genetic, dietary, microbial, and biological contributions [2,3].

Children with obesity who later entered adulthood with obesity faced a significantly increased risk of cardiometabolic events [4]. However, if a child with obesity entered adulthood at a normal weight, their risk returned to that of any other adult who possessed a normal weight their entire life [4]. Thus, early intervention is vital to curtailing the obesity epidemic. Of note, this study did not detail which, if any, specific interventions helped children with obesity develop a normal weight as an adult.

Obesity treatments include lifestyle interventions, medications, and bariatric surgery. Current pediatric obesity treatment algorithms no longer focus on lifestyle modifications alone [3,11,12]. The following medications, listed by date of approval, provide some effectiveness in adult populations, with expanding use in children [13]. Orlistat, one of the earlier Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medications for weight loss in individuals aged 12 and older, is rarely used in current clinical practice due to unpleasant side effects such as flatulence [3]. Metformin is a drug used in diabetes management that also promotes weight loss in children who have insulin resistance [11]. However, it is not approved by the FDA for the sole indication of weight reduction, and generally does not result in significant weight loss when taken alone [11]. Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist whose approval was extended to adolescents aged 12 to 17 in 2020 [14]. While its use in the pediatric population is increasing, many patients decline initiation of the drug since it requires a daily subcutaneous injection. Setmelanotide, approved in 2021, is one of the first FDA-approved medications for chronic weight management in genetic causes of obesity including pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1), and leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiencies [15]. However, these monogenic causes of obesity are rare and the utility of this medication to treat other types of obesity remains unknown. More recently, the combination of phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia) has been approved in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older as of 2022 but has side effects like dizziness [16]. One promising drug, currently approved for adults, is semaglutide, a GLP-1 agonist that is only administered once-weekly (rather than daily as with liraglutide) [17]. In November 2022, Weghuber et al. published a clinical trial where semaglutide garnered significant weight reduction in adolescents (pending FDA approval for this age group) [17]. In an adult head-to-head comparison trial, semaglutide was significantly more effective than liraglutide in terms of mean weight reduction (15.8% vs. 6.4%, respectively) [18]. All the medications listed above have risks and benefits, but the overall weight loss associated with their use is far less than the weight loss seen after bariatric surgery, which has led to increased utilization of bariatric surgery in the pediatric age groups [3,12].

Alqahtani et al. studied the largest cohort to date of children and adolescents undergoing weight-loss surgery, with 2504 participants undergoing VSG over 10 years. Their group showed durable weight loss and maintained comorbidity resolution [27]. They were also one of the few groups to measure vertical growth over time; patients reassuringly had unaltered growth, which is of particular concern in the pediatric population [27]. However, it is important to note that long-term data was limited to approximately 25% (632 patients) of the entire cohort [36].

The intestinal microbiota is a complex community of bacteria, prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea [37]. There are approximately 3.8 × 1013 bacterial cells in and on the human body and 3.0 × 1013 human cells, equating the bacterial to human cell ratio to be approximately 1:1, as opposed to the frequently cited 10:1 ratio [38]. The evolution of symbiosis between the human gastrointestinal tract and its resident microbiota confers reciprocal interactions between the gut microbiome and the host, with important consequences for human health and physiology [39].

There are likely several mechanisms involved in the relationship between the gut microbiota and obesity, though functional studies are limited. Chierico et al. studied the composition of gut microbiota in relation to metagenome functional content in adolescents and adults with obesity compared to age-matched volunteers with normal weight [47]. The adolescents with obesity had more of an association with primary bile acid biosynthesis, steroid acid biosynthesis, fructose metabolism, mannose metabolism, galactose metabolism, butanoate metabolism, pentose phosphate metabolism, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. However, the adolescents with a normal weight had more of an association with secondary bile acids, steroid hormone metabolism, lipoic acid metabolism, and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism [47]. Primary bile acids are those synthesized by the liver and secondary bile acids are the result of conversion of primary bile acids by colonic bacteria [50]. Secondary bile acids influence energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis in a positive fashion via their effects on gluconeogenesis, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity [51]. Insulin exerts pleiotropic effects on multiple organs; it regulates body fat through a dynamic network of factors that control energy imbalance [52]. Direct measurements of gut microbiota derived metabolites also showed differences between individuals with obesity and those with a normal weight [53]. Although there was variation between studies, a meta-analysis showed that stool from adults with obesity compared to stool from adults with a normal BMI have increased levels of short chain fatty acids [54].

The first significant microbial exposure in infancy occurs at birth, microbes closely resembling microbes encountered during the birthing process colonize the infant’s gut [55,56]. Vaginally delivered infants acquire bacterial communities resembling their own mother’s vaginal microbiota, which is dominated by Lactobacillus, Prevotella, and Sneathia [57]. In contrast, Caesarian section delivered infants acquire bacterial communities resembling those of maternal skin, which is dominated by Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium [57]. Moreover, there is differential subsequent development of the gut microbiome in infants delivered by Caesarian section compared with vaginal delivery [58]. Most notably, infants delivered by Caesarian section have overrepresentation of pathobionts, especially specific strains acquired from their mother, and underrepresentation of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium [58]. While these differences by delivery mode are most pronounced during the first year of life, some differences persist into early childhood [59]. Furthermore, impacts to microbiome development during critical early-life periods of immune and metabolic programming have long-term health consequences [56]. This is especially important since the children of mothers who have obesity are more likely to develop obesity themselves, and babies who are born by Caesarian section are also more likely to develop obesity [60,61]. Moreover, exposure to antibiotics early in life profoundly alters the gut microbiome [62,63]. Antibiotics in early life are associated with later obesity, with animal models indicating a causal effect by the gut microbiome [56,64,65].

There is dynamic development of the gut microbiome early in life, with rapidly increasing diversity over the first few years of life [66,67,68,69]. Koenig et al. conducted an intriguing study in which one full-term male infant was chronicled with stool samples daily for 2.5 years, allowing for an in-depth look into the dynamics of a developing intestinal ecosystem in relation to known disturbances (i.e., breastfeeding, introduction of solids, antibiotic usage) [68]. The authors observed an increase in diversity over time. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of the samples showed a dramatic and sustained increase in abundance of Bacteroidetes immediately after the introduction of peas and other table foods. Bacteroidetes are specialized in the breakdown of complex plant polysaccharides [68]. Low levels of Bacteroidetes in the gut are correlated with obesity, with obesity itself potentially resulting from a diet low in plant-derived polysaccharides [42,68].

Overall, the infant gut microbiome is rapidly colonized and plays an important role in the development and education of host mammalian immune and metabolic systems. There appears to be a “critical window of opportunity” for education of these systems [70]. If that “window” is missed, and host-commensal interactions are disrupted, diseases may develop later in life, including obesity, food allergies, and asthma [56,70].

Some studies suggest that the gut microbiome becomes relatively stable and adult-like in the first 1 to 3 years of life [66,67,68,69], but other evidence indicates that it continues to develop into the teenage years [67,71,72]. Agans et al., studied gut microbiota in adolescent children (ages 11–18) versus adults and found that the abundance of Bifidobacterium was significantly higher in adolescent children than in adults [72]. The authors implied that levels of Bifidobacteria in children decreased gradually between 2 and 18 years of age until reaching stable levels in early adulthood, rather than plummeting quickly after toddlerhood [72].

Collectively, these results suggest that the healthy pediatric gut microbiome harbors compositional and functional aspects that differ from similarly matched healthy adults, and that the gut microbiome may undergo a more prolonged development than previously anticipated [67]. Therefore, childhood and adolescence may provide opportunities for microbiome interventions to promote health or prevent obesity, since the developing microbiome plays a more definitive role in establishing metabolic pathways involved with energy regulation [73,74,75,76,77].

There are data suggesting that aberrant compositional development of gut microbiota precedes being overweight [78,79], offering new possibilities for preventive and therapeutic applications in weight management [80]. Cani et al., demonstrated that mice fed a high fat diet developed insulin resistance and inflammation by a mechanism directly dependent on lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an essential component of the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria such as Bacteroides [78]. They found that a high fat diet increased the proportion of LPS-containing microbiota in the gut [78]. In a subsequent study, they reported that mice fed a high fat diet had reduced amounts of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides when compared to controls fed a standard diet [81]. Moreover, they noted increased rates of plasma LPS concentrations associated with lower Bifidobacterium levels in the intestinal microbiota. Bifidobacteria were shown to reduce intestinal endotoxin levels and upgrade mucosal barrier function [82]. The supplementation of prebiotic dietary fiber in mice fed a high fat diet increased Bifidobacteria in the gut, leading to a reduction of endotoxins in the blood [81]. The specialized diet was also strongly associated with improved glucose tolerance as explained by normalization of glucose-induced insulin secretion [81]. Furthermore, in later studies they also found increased gut permeability from inflammation enhanced LPS absorption [79].

The gut microbiota also influences host adiposity by energy extraction from the diet and by regulation of metabolism throughout the body [83,84]. For example, Bäckhed et al. showed that gut microbiota influenced host fat storage in mice [83]. Fasting-induced adipocyte factor (Fiaf), a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, suppression was essential for gut microbiota-induced deposition of triglycerides in adipocytes. The gut microbiota inhibited Fiaf, caused increased hepatic lipogenesis with increased lipoprotein lipase activity in adipocytes, thereby promoting storage of calories harvested from the diet into fat [83]. The above data in total suggest that restoration of the gut microbiota to a healthy state may ameliorate conditions associated with obesity and help maintain a healthy weight [85].

Moving beyond associations, several murine models showed a causal role of the gut microbiota in obesity. Body fat, fat mass, and obesity-associated metabolic phenotypes can be transferred via gut microbiota, as shown in a study where fecal samples from human adult females with obesity were transferred into germ free mice [86]. Furthermore, early life antibiotic-induced obesity can also be transferred into germ free mice [56]. Moreover, the intestinal microbiota of mice with obesity was more effective at extracting calories from food than that of mice with a normal weight [87]. This trait that can be passed to germ-free mice via fecal microbiota transplant, thereby causing increased adiposity in those initially germ-free mice [87]. These studies did not detail any adverse side effects regarding the mice.

Probiotics are live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host, with strain-specific mechanisms of action [88]. Beneficial microbes such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus are commonly used as probiotics [73]. Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses in humans showed that probiotics may have some benefit in combating obesity, however, data were inconsistent, with other studies showing no significant effect of probiotics in reducing BMI [89,90].

Prebiotics are selectively fermented ingredients that confer a health benefit to the host through specific changes in the composition of or activity of the gastrointestinal microbiota [91]. Prebiotics must also meet three criteria: (1) resistance to gastric acid, bile, and digestive enzymes; (2) ability to undergo fermentation by gut microbiota; and (3) ability to stimulate the growth and/or activity of commensal gut microbiota [91]. Gut hormones such as GLP-1 play a critical role in relaying signals of nutritional and energy status from the gut to the central nervous system to control food intake [76]. GLP-1 is upregulated by prebiotics, suggesting that prebiotics may be used to control food intake [76]. Nicolucci et al. illustrated that the prebiotic of an oligofructose-enriched inulin selectively altered the intestinal microbiota, and significantly reduced body weight z-score in children with overweight and obesity compared to placebo [92]. However, Liber et al. did not show a difference in BMI when using the prebiotic of oligofructose-enriched inulin compared to placebo in children with overweight and obesity [93].

“Synbiotics” are a combination of probiotics and prebiotics [94]. Synbiotics have the potential to induce more beneficial effects on the gut microbiota than isolated intake of pre- or probiotics. They promote the survival and implantation of live microbial dietary supplements in the gastrointestinal tract of the host [94]. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Mohammadi et al. of probiotics and synbiotics, did not illustrate any significant changes in BMI, waist circumference, body fat, fasting blood glucose, or lipid profiles before and after supplementation with probiotics/synbiotics for 4–16 weeks [95]. However, a subgroup analysis by intervention type, revealed a significant reduction in BMI with synbiotic supplementation [95].

Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is a process aimed to restore microbial homeostasis to altered gut microbiota by transplanting stool from a healthy donor into a recipient via pills, nasogastric/nasojejunal tubes, colonoscopy, enema, rectal tube, or sigmoidoscopy [96]. The Gut Bugs Trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing the efficacy of FMT to treat obesity and improve metabolism, with the primary outcome being BMI standard deviation at 6 weeks post-FMT [97]. The participants included 87 adolescents (ages 14–18) with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. The teenagers received a single course of oral encapsulated fecal microbiota from donors of the same sex or saline placebo, with a 26-week follow-up. FMT did not show an effect on BMI, insulin sensitivity, liver function, lipid profile, inflammatory markers, blood pressure, or gut health, but it did show a reduction in abdominal adiposity. The participants faced no serious adverse events, although minor adverse events occurred, with the most common being loose stools in 10% of participants. [97]. Prior FMT studies in adults with obesity also did not show a significant change in BMI [98,99], although a temporary improvement in insulin sensitivity was demonstrated in two studies [100,101]. Conversely, two other studies reported no effects on insulin sensitivity, but showed sustained gut microbiota changes after FMT [98,99].

There are risks associated with FMT. There have been cases of infectious pathogen transmission resulting in hospitalization or even death [102,103]. Furthermore, other unintended characteristics may be transferred. For example, a woman with a normal BMI quickly gained 34 pounds after receiving a fecal transplant from her daughter with an overweight BMI for the treatment of a Clostridioides difficile infection [104]. However, the research team could not say with certainty that the transplant spurred the sudden weight gain [104].

Weight loss mediated through bariatric surgery was initially thought to be a direct result of mechanical alterations causing restriction and calorie malabsorption, but the degree of enhanced metabolism after surgery cannot be explained by caloric restriction and weight loss alone [25,26,105,106]. Bariatric surgery induces changes in the anatomy of the digestive tract, gastric emptying, hormonal status, quantity and choice of ingested nutrients, and the metabolism of bile acids, which all might modify the gut microbiota composition [75,107,108]. In addition, host physiological responses include “resetting” of the body’s metabolism and hunger signals, with energy harvesting through hormonal changes [105]. Furthermore, given the established impact that the gut microbiota has on adiposity, it is likely that complex enteric microbe-host responses contribute to surgery-mediated weight loss and maintenance of weight loss post-surgery [75,105]. A systematic review by Guo et al., on human and mouse model bariatric surgery, demonstrated that microbial composition greatly changed after surgery [109]. Overall, it showed increased Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Proteobacteria with decreased microbial groups of Firmicutes, Clostridiales, Clostridiaceae, Blautia, and Dorea [109].

Some of the most convincing evidence that the gut microbiota community can impact surgery-mediated weight loss in a causal manner comes from mice studies involving fecal transplant. Liou et al. tested a mouse model of RYGB surgery [117]. The transfer of stool from RYGB-treated mice to non-operated, germ-free mice led to weight loss in the recipient animals. In contrast, the transfer of stool from non-RYGB abdominal surgery control mice, to non-operated, germ-free mice, conferred no weight change in the recipient animals. This study was the first empirical claim that changes in gut microbiota contribute to reduced host weight after RYGB [117]. Similar findings were found in RYGB rat models [118]. However, such robust evidence for the role of the gut microbiota in the success of bariatric surgery in humans has not yet been demonstrated.

Gut microbiome changes after bariatric surgery in children and adolescents are largely unknown. No reported studies have involved pediatric patients (17 years of age or younger) [113]. Pediatric institutions often treat patients up to age 21, meaning that there is some age overlap with adult studies in patients aged 18 to 21. However, most of the studies focused on middle aged adults and did not provide raw data to analyze individual patients by age [113]. Furthermore, most published studies focused on patients undergoing RYGB, not VSG, the most common bariatric procedure for children and adolescents [19]. Therefore, it is important to study the gut microbiota in children and adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery, as a child’s microbiome differs from an adult, is developing, and plays a clearer role in establishing metabolic pathways that could impact energy regulation in obesity (Figure 2).

A significant knowledge gap remains regarding the specific contribution of enteric microbes to weight loss following bariatric surgery, especially in children and adolescents [105]. Additionally, it is unknown whether the pre-surgical composition of intestinal microbiota can predict whether an individual will lose a substantial amount of weight or predict who will maintain their post-surgical weight loss [105].

The budding field of live biotherapeutics, which targets specific groups of microorganisms instead of replacing the entire gut microbiota landscape via FMT, could lead to more efficacious microbial therapies for obesity [119]. Companies developing live biotherapeutics currently have ongoing clinical trials for Clostridioides difficile infection, solid tumors, food allergies, and asthma [119,120]. Long-term, live biotherapeutics for obesity may be developed, but no clinical trials are currently underway [119,120].

In conclusion, early intervention is vital to curtailing the obesity epidemic, because if a child with obesity can enter adult life at a normal weight, their risk of adverse health outcomes returns to that of any other adult who possessed a normal weight their entire life. Current literature suggests a role for the gut microbiome in weight loss management. Given that children and adolescents have a dynamic gut microbiome, while an adult’s gut microbiome is more static, children and adolescents are prime targets for studies to better understand the mechanistic role of the gut microbiome in the development and treatment of obesity. A study investigating the gut microbiota of pediatric patients before and after bariatric surgery would likely help to elucidate the pathophysiology of childhood obesity, by characterizing the functional role of the gut microbiome during rapid weight loss. Such information could be used in developing microbial-based therapies to mitigate the obesity crisis.
