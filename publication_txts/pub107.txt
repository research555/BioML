Leaky Gum: The Revisited Origin of Systemic Diseases

The oral cavity is the gateway for microorganisms into your body where they disseminate not only to the directly connected respiratory and digestive tracts but also to the many remote organs. Oral microbiota, travelling to the end of the intestine and circulating in our bodies through blood vessels, not only affect a gut microbiome profile but also lead to many systemic diseases. By gathering information accumulated from the era of focal infection theory to the age of revolution in microbiome research, we propose a pivotal role of “leaky gum”, as an analogy of “leaky gut”, to underscore the importance of the oral cavity in systemic health. The oral cavity has unique structures, the gingival sulcus (GS) and the junctional epithelium (JE) below the GS, which are rarely found anywhere else in our body. The JE is attached to the tooth enamel and cementum by hemidesmosome (HD), which is structurally weaker than desmosome and is, thus, vulnerable to microbial infiltration. In the GS, microbial biofilms can build up for life, unlike the biofilms on the skin and intestinal mucosa that fall off by the natural process. Thus, we emphasize that the GS and the JE are the weakest leaky point for microbes to invade the human body, making the leaky gum just as important as, or even more important than, the leaky gut.

Humans internalize the microbiota of this planet through the oral cavity, either temporarily or permanently. The oral cavity harbours the second most abundant microorganisms after the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in a variety of distinct habitats, such as teeth, tongue, gingival sulcus (GS), palate, saliva, buccal mucosa, and throat. The expanded Human Oral Microbiome Database (eHOMD v3, http://homd.org, accessed on 16 February 2022) established during the Human Microbiome Project enlists at least 774 microbial species to date.

In this review, we gather current knowledge of disease-related oral pathogens and contrast the anatomical structures of oral versus gut mucosal layers in the context of microbial leak into a human body, embossing the role of oral pathogens in the development of systemic diseases.

The largest portion of research funds has been digested by gut bacteria because the majority of human microbiota resides in the colon [19]. The findings of their roles in human immune systems have been extensively illuminating. The human intestine is the widest and longest space in contact with microorganisms compared to the oral cavity or the skin. It boasts almost 10 metres of length and 400 m2 of luminal surface area. In addition, it allows the passage of about 60 tons of food during a lifetime while processing digestion and absorption, making the role of gut bacteria even more important [20]. Especially, gut bacteria, numbering almost equivalent to the human cells [19], metabolize dietary fibers to yield short-chain fatty acids, an essential task of which humans are not capable. They not only provide intestinal cells with immune substances and vitamins but also keep the intestinal homeostasis. The homeostasis of the intestinal microbiome itself and between the intestinal microbiome and the host has been conceptualized as a “symbiosis” of the intestinal ecosystem [21].

The association between intestinal and systemic diseases can be found in extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs) of intestinal diseases. For example, the EIMs of IBD affect joints, eyes, liver, lung, and pancreas [43]. About 15% of people with ulcerative colitis (UC) [44] and up to 40% of patients with Crohn’s disease [45,46,47,48], both are types of IBD, have skin issues. In some EIMs cases, such as peripheral arthritis, oral aphthous ulcers, episcleritis, and erythema nodosum, symptoms can improve on standard treatment of the intestinal inflammation [43]. In addition, IBD and periodontitis have been reported to affect each other, and several nutritional deficiencies and systemic diseases are known to be manifested in the oral cavity [49,50], which is supporting bidirectional influence in the context of an oral–gut axis. In the same vein, bacteria can travel via the bloodstream to reach and colonize in the tumour microenvironment (TME) of melanoma, lung, ovarian, glioblastoma, pancreatic, bone, and breast cancer where ~106 intratumoural bacteria per palpable 1-cm3 tumour can be found [32,51].

The lumen of the digestive tract, a twisted hollow tube from the oral cavity to the anus, is continuously overloaded with the external environment [52]. Thus, just as the human skin protects our body, the oral and intestinal mucosa, which cover the inner surface of our body, should exert barrier function physically and physiologically [38,39]. Yet unlike the skin whose major function is building a physical barrier, the major function of the mucosal membrane comprises several physiological barriers. For example, saliva and mucus on the epithelium contain antibacterial substances, such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, commensal flora, and antibacterial peptides, which inhibit pathogen colonization [53,54].

Mucosal immunity in the oral cavity is also gaining traction with the advance of microbiome research [59,60]. The oral mucosa, like the skin, is composed of both keratinized and non-keratinized tissues (Figure 1c). The thickness of the keratinized layers of the oral mucosa, however, is thinner than that of the skin. Thus, the oral mucosa, similar to the intestinal mucosa, supplements chemical and biological defence functions using saliva. The oral mucosa also consists of 3–5 cellular layers that are thicker than the intestinal mucosa monolayer. Anatomically and histologically, the oral mucosa appears as a transitional layer between the intestinal mucosa and the skin [61].

For humans, the primary teeth erupt through the mucous membrane from the inner alveolar bone at about six months of age, forming unique structures originating from the interface between the exposed teeth and the surrounding tissues. Those interface structures, the GS and the JE below the GS, are essential for the survival of animals that need mastication of ingested food (Figure 1d). For adults with permanent teeth, the healthy GS depth can reach 3 mm. Thus, below the GS there should be a sealing layer that binds the soft tissue, especially the JE, with the surface layer of the hard tissue (enamel and cementum), protecting the tissues from external challenges. The JE has the highest turnover rate (4–6 days) of all oral epithelia and remains undifferentiated and non-keratinized [62]. In the JE, the binding proteins are generated by the basal layer of soft tissues only to form HD with the hard tissues of a tooth (Figure 1d, magnified box). The internal basal lamina (IBL), the intercellular space in the HD, are relatively wide, allowing water-soluble substances to pass through them with ease. These structural limitations of the HD between the JE and the tooth can provide pathogens with a good opportunity to invade the human body [63,64,65]. To compensate for this inherent structural weakness, immune cells such as polymorphic nuclear leukocytes (PMNs) transude into the GS together with gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), taking constant vigilance even without any signs of inflammation [66,67]. Ironically, to allow immune cells to pass through a JE layer, the JE cells have fewer desmosomes that bind the cells vertically than the other oral epithelia, adding another structural instability to JE [68].

The important roles of the GS and the JE were embossed in a seminal study conducted on 417 patients at 11 nursing homes in Japan [72]. In this study, older patients who received oral care exhibited lower cases of pneumonia, febrile days, and death from pneumonia, while showing improved metrics of activities of daily living (ADL) and cognitive functions evaluated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). By contrast, the total mortality rate was greater in the dentate group (13.5%, 28/208) than in the edentate group (10%, 16/158). The mortality rate of dentate and edentate groups with oral care was similar (6% and 7%, respectively), but without oral care, the mortality rate of the dentate group (20%) was higher than that of the edentate group (13%) even if ADL and MMSE scores were slightly worse in the edentate group at the time of final evaluation. The reduced mortality rate in the edentate group without oral care, although not fully discussed in this study, may indicate that the edentate state is somehow advantageous for longevity if proper oral care cannot be administered. Indeed, the spot where the tooth is removed becomes covered with mucosal membrane and transforms like the mucosa of the skin and the intestine (Figure 2c). In other words, the absence of teeth may render more effective protection from bacterial infections by removing the vulnerable structures originating from the GS and the JE [73].

Concerns have already existed since the end of the 19th century that the oral cavity could be a source of human pathogenic microbes. In the 1890s, Willoughby D. Miller, who studied at the Koch Institute, warned of the dangers of oral microbes [74,75]. Miller, riding on the bandwagon of the “germ theory” of disease established at the end of the 19th century, suggested that the oral cavity, a breeding ground for many pathogens, could be an origin of many diseases of unknown aetiology, such as CVDs, pneumonia, angina pectoris, and foot gangrene [76]. Miller’s study has established a modern daily routine for oral care, such as brushing teeth three times a day and flossing. His argument was later accepted as “oral sepsis” by British surgeon William Hunter in the early 1900s [77] and expanded as “focal infection theory” by American physician Frank Billings in the 1910s [78]. It was further amplified by Henry Cotton who claimed that mental illness could be improved by tooth extraction or tonsillectomy [79]. Even accepted by the physicians at Johns Hopkins University and Mayo Clinic, the theory was implemented into routine clinical practice. The theory was so widely expanded that Russell Cecil, an eminent author of Cecil Essentials of Medicine, also joined the club. In the 1940s, however, Hobart A. Reinmann and W. Paul Havens pointed out, in their critical appraisal of focal infection in relation to systemic disease, that the theory lacks clinical evidence and the causative relationship of infections of teeth and tonsils to systemic disease is unproven [80]. Consequently, in the late 1950s, the theory gradually vanished and was regarded as fringe medicine.

In the 21st century, the focal infection theory began to be revisited from a different perspective [81]. For example, bacteremia, a temporary infiltration of bacteria into blood vessels, has been regarded as an illness resolved by immune responses within an hour [65]. Recent culture-independent microbial research techniques, however, have shown that bacteria or bacterial DNA are always present in the blood vessels of healthy people [82,83,84]. These findings suggest that bacteremia may not be a temporary nor a localized problem. Furthermore, it has been revealed that microbes can be found in the lungs of healthy people [5,85,86] and cancer patients [87], the placenta of healthy pregnant women, albeit controversial [1,2,3,4], and the brains in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [88,89,90,91,92], which had long been considered sterile.

The origin of bacteria found in remote organs converges to the oral cavity [93,94,95,96] (Figure 3). For example, the placental microbiome profiles were most comparable to those of the oral microbiome [1]. The overlap of the unique members of oral microbes with other remote organs is consistent with previous clinical studies in which Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Gram-negative oral anaerobe, were clinically suspected to be a major risk factor in colorectal cancer [97,98,99], oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) [100], and in preterm and term stillbirth [101,102]. Likewise, an infamous oral pathogenic bacterium, Porphyromonas gingivalis, is related to pancreatic cancer [103], colorectal cancer [104,105,106], liver health [107], rheumatoid arthritis [108,109], diabetes [110,111,112], OSCC [113,114], and neurodegenerative diseases [88,89,90,91,92,115,116,117,118]. In the case of atherosclerotic CVD, when the vascular tissues of the coronary and femoral arteries of the patients with CVD were examined, P. gingivalis was found in 42 out of 42 patients [119]. Thus, previously explained by the passive accumulation of fat, the aetiology of CVD is now leaning toward inflammatory responses of the vascular endothelium [120,121]. Notably, live P. gingivalis is known to traffic into endoplasmic reticulum-rich autophagosomes [122] and target host ectonucleotidase-CD73 [123] for its chronic survival, replication, and persistence in the dysbiotic human gingival epithelia [124].

AD is one of the representative neurodegenerative diseases diagnosed with senile plaques and abundant neurofibrillary tangles, which can be deteriorated by oral pathogenic infection. Gingival-infected P. gingivalis was reported to exacerbate the accumulation of Aβ plaques and inflammatory cytokines in brain specimens of amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice [140]. Interestingly, the anatomic analysis demonstrated that P. gingivalis genomic DNA was detected in brain specimens of 9 out of 12 Apoe−/− mice orally challenged with P. gingivalis for 24 weeks [139], implicating that P. gingivalis can penetrate the gum and enter the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The result that intravenous injection of P. gingivalis into rats enhanced tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus can reinforce the theory of BBB penetration of P. gingivalis [143]. As similar atherosclerotic CVD, PgLPS has also been designated as P. gingivalis-driven virulence factor affecting AD. It was reported that PgLPS treatment to rat brain neonatal microglial cells promoted the release of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and IL-6 [138], and palatal gingival infection of PgLPS into rats induced alveolar bone loss and increased serum Aβ levels [142]. Middle-aged wild-type (WT) mice intraperitoneally challenged with PgLPS for 5 weeks represented learning and memory deficit and microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, although age-matched mice deficient for cathepsin B (Catb−/−) were insensitive to PgLPS [141]. In addition to PgLPS, gingipain is an AD virulence factor, a unique class of cysteine proteinase that comprises Lys-gingipain (Kgp) and Arg-gingipain (Rgp). The modulatory role of the gingipain on neuroinflammation was well-established using Kgp and Rgp inhibitors (KYT1 and KYT36, respectively) or P. gingivalis KDP129, a gingipain-deficient mutant strain [137]. In this study, KYT1 and KYT36 treatment effectively inhibited P. gingivalis-driven increased expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in immortalized mouse microglial cell line MG6. Injection of P. gingivalis, but not KDP129 strain, into the somatosensory cortex of mice can recruit microglia to the injection site, revealing that gingipain is the effective factor for microglial migration and accumulation around P. gingivalis in the brain [137].

Thanks to rapid advances in gene sequencing technology combined with nanotechnology and information technology, the human microbiome proves to be present even in bodily sites previously known to be sterile. Intriguingly, the microbiome inside the human body mostly originates from the oral cavity, reminiscing the focal infection theory backed by more recent scientific proofs. Indeed, the oral cavity has unique mucosal structures such as the PP and the JE with innate vulnerability where oral pathogens can colonize for life and leak into blood vessels to circulate throughout the body, resulting in many systemic diseases in remote sites. As of now, although just a few molecules (PgLPS or gingipain) have been unravelled as oral pathogen-induced toxic molecules, we need to figure out many other causative candidates derived from oral pathogens to reinforce the attribution of leaky gum to various types of systemic diseases. Filled with anticipation for more causative evidence from well-designed empirical studies, we also need to focus on how to provide a leaky gum with a protective shield made of biological, not physicochemical, knowledge. By doing so, we can look forward to the realization of more prominent personalized medicine for systemic health by striking a balance between oral microbiota and its host.
