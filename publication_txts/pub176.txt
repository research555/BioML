Evaluating live microbiota biobanking using an ex vivo microbiome assay and metaproteomics



Biobanking of live microbiota is becoming indispensable for mechanistic and clinical investigations of drug–microbiome interactions and fecal microbiota transplantation. However, there is a lack of methods to rapidly and systematically evaluate whether the biobanked microbiota maintains their cultivability and functional activity. In this study, we use a rapid ex vivo microbiome assay and metaproteomics to evaluate the cultivability and the functional responses of biobanked microbiota to treatment with a prebiotic (fructo-oligosaccharide, FOS). Our results indicate that the microbiota cultivability and their functional responses to FOS treatment were well maintained by freezing in a deoxygenated glycerol buffer at −80°C for 12 months. We also demonstrate that the fecal microbiota is functionally stable for 48 hours on ice in a deoxygenated glycerol buffer, allowing off-site fecal sample collection and shipping to laboratory for live microbiota biobanking. This study provides a method for rapid evaluation of the cultivability of biobanked live microbiota. Our results show minimal detrimental influences of long-term freezing in deoxygenated glycerol buffer on the cultivability of fecal microbiota.

Increasing evidence associates the gut microbiota with human health and the development of various diseases, including both intestinal and non-intestinal disorders.1–3 Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)4,5 and to overcome resistance to anti-PD1 therapy in melanoma patients.6,7 Small molecules, prebiotics and dietary components are also being studied in high-throughput in vitro microbiome screens to identify potential therapeutics targeting the gut microbiota8–12 and to study the effects of the microbiome on these compounds.13 Although some successes have emerged in therapeutic interventions of gut microbiota for disease management,14–16 there is a need for systematic and robust study of microbiome-therapeutic interactions. Biobanked live microbiota are increasingly used for FMT and in high-throughput screening for new therapeutics, but most studies do not investigate whether biobanked microbiota maintain their functionalities.

High-throughput whole-microbiome culture methods have been recently developed.11,13 For example, we reported a rapid assay for individual microbiome (RapidAIM),11 which maintains the functional profiles of individual gut microbiomes. RapidAIM has been used to screen, evaluate, and reclassify the modulating effects of drugs, natural compounds, and dietary components against individual human microbiomes.8,9 In this study, we used the RapidAIM assay and quantitative metaproteomics to determine whether freezing and delayed sample processing of human gut microbiota affect their cultivability and functional responses to treatments. In this study, fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) was selected as an example treatment because it is a prebiotic with well known in vitro modulating effects on microbiota,22–24 such as the increase of Actinobacrteria species. Briefly, fresh and frozen microbiomes isolated from human stools were cultured in the RapidAIM assay with or without FOS. We showed that microbiome samples stored in deoxygenated, buffered 10% glycerol at −80°C were stable and maintained their functional responses to FOS treatment for up to 1 year. In addition, we demonstrated that gut microbiomes were stable on ice with glycerol-based preservation buffer for 48 hours prior to sample processing and biobanking. This study provides a convenient and rapid approach for evaluating live microbiota and reveals that freezing in glycerol-based preservation buffer at −80°C minimally affects the cultivability and activity of gut microbiomes.

We first evaluated whether frozen biobanked fecal microbiota maintain their cultivability and functions. Briefly, fresh stools from three adult volunteers were collected, processed to make a final concentration of 20% (weight (g)/volume (mL), w/v) fecal slurry in 10% (volume (mL)/volume (mL), v/v) glycerol buffer (containing 1 mg/ml L-cysteine and pre-equilibrated in anaerobic workstation over night). The fecal slurry was aliquoted and stored at −80°C up to 1 year with testing at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 52 weeks (1 year) by RapidAIM (Figure 1a). RapidAIM culturing was performed with or without 5 mg/ml of FOS for 24 hours in an anaerobic workstation. The microbiome cultures as well as the uncultured baseline samples were analyzed by shotgun metaproteomics to examine the functional microbiome profiles overtime.

In this study, 181 MS raw files were generated, including 16 quality control (QC) MS runs. Protein identification with MetaLab software yielded 83,273 unique peptide sequences and 20,304 protein groups, with an average MS spectra identification rate of 42.1 ± 6.9% (mean ± standard deviation). To examine the overall protein expression profiles, protein groups that were quantified in at least 50% of the samples were used for principal component analysis (PCA, Figure 1b). As shown in the PCA score plot, QC runs clustered closely together, indicating high quality and consistency of the metaproteomic data throughout the year (Figure 1b). Overall, the samples segregated into three clusters according to the individual origin of microbiomes tested. Both pre- and post-cultured microbiome samples of the same individual clustered together, suggesting adequate maintenance of the microbiome functional profiles.10 Within each individual microbiome, the treatment of FOS led to obvious separation (as represented by the second principal component, PC2) (Figure 1b). These findings suggest that the individuality of microbiome functions was well maintained by biobanking, ex vivo culturing, as well as the treatment with prebiotic FOS.

A total of 19,134 (94%) identified gut microbial protein groups were annotated with the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) database, representing 1214 COGs and 24 COG categories. The relative abundances of COGs were then used for PCA analysis, which again demonstrated consistency of individual microbiome functional responses to culturing, biobanking and treatment with FOS (Figure 2). Obvious separation of samples treated with and without FOS was observed along the second PC for all three microbiomes (Figure 2). We then calculated the abundance distributions at COG category level for each group, which showed highly similar patterns for all microbiomes at all different time points (Figure 3). Interestingly, consistent functional responses of cultured microbiomes to FOS could be observed for all tested time points, indicating well maintained cultivability and activity of the biobanked microbiomes.

Quantitative taxonomic analysis was performed using identified distinctive peptides that were determined with a lowest common ancestor (LCA) approach. In total, 17 phyla from all 4 superkingdoms, 25 classes, 36 orders, 49 families, 74 genera, and 163 species were quantified using a threshold of ≥3 distinctive peptides. Overall phylum-level distribution of the pre- and post-cultured microbiomes showed high consistency of different groups and was distinct for different individuals (Figure 4). FOS is known to elevate the growth of Actinobacteria both in vitro and in vivo.22–24 Accordingly, consistent responses of the phylum Actinobacteria to FOS treatment were observed across all time points for all three tested microbiomes (Figure 5). Genus level analysis also showed that the two most abundant genera from Actinobacteria, Collinsella and Bifidobacterium, were consistently increased by FOS treatment (Figure S1). The relative abundances of several phyla, such as Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria, were found to be responsive to freezing in certain microbiomes (Figure 4). In microbiome V31, the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia was increased in the cultured samples using biobanked stools compared to those using fresh stools. In microbiome V33, Fusobacteria were found to increase when frozen inoculums were used. With the supplementation of FOS, the relative abundances of Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria in cultured microbiomes using frozen inoculums were decreased to similar levels to those using fresh inoculums in V31 and V33, respectively (Figure S2). These findings suggest that biobanking might lead to growth advantages for some bacterial species in the microbial community.

During biobanking, there is usually a delay prior to sample processing as the stools are usually collected off-site and shipped/transferred to the laboratory. We thereby evaluated whether fecal microbiota samples are stable during a delayed sample processing. We first compared stools that are (1) processed immediately, (2) stored on ice for 6 hours in deoxygenated glycerol buffer, and (3) directly stored on dry ice for 6 hours. Each of the stools was processed and cultured using RapidAIM assay with or without the treatment of FOS, and cultured samples were collected for metaproteomic analyses. PCA analysis of quantified protein groups showed that, for all the 3 tested microbiomes, most variations were found to be contributed by FOS treatment, however the samples from stools that were kept on dry ice were separated from fresh stools or stools that were kept on ice (Figure 6a). Taxonomic analysis also showed that the phylum level composition was more similar between fresh and ice-stored microbiomes than that between fresh and dry ice-stored microbiomes (Figure 6b). Interestingly, Fusobacteria were also found to be increased in V33 samples with dry ice-stored stools as inoculum, but not in those with ice-stored stools as inoculum (Figure 6b). These findings suggest that temporary storage of fecal samples on ice with deoxygenated glycerol buffer is better than on dry ice for maintaining the cultivability of microbiomes.

We also evaluated whether fecal samples can be stored on ice for up to 48 hours mimicking a two-day shipping procedure for sample collection. Briefly, we simulated the shipping process by keeping stools in shipping packages with ice packs for 0, 24 and 48 hours, respectively, prior to processing and RapidAIM culturing. As shown in Figure 7a, while there was a shift along with the increase of shipping hours at PC2 (explained 7.26% of the total variations), most of the variations (57.12%) of the overall microbiome protein expressions were contributed by the treatment by FOS. Taxonomic analysis also showed that relatively stable phylum level composition of cultured microbiomes was obtained for up to 48 hours, and consistent responses of cultured microbiomes to FOS treatment were achieved (Figure 7b).

The development of novel intervention approaches targeting the gut microbiome requires a high throughput screening of potential therapeutics against the microbiome, which leads to the increasing use of live microbiota.25 Due to the operational challenges for using fresh stools, most studies used frozen biobanked samples. However, evaluation of the functionality of frozen microbiotas has not been standardized and was missed in most studies. A few studies evaluated the performance of frozen microbiota using animal models and FMT.20,21 However, animal experiments are expensive and time-consuming. In this study, we used the RapidAIM assay11 and metaproteomics to evaluate over 1 year whether frozen fecal microbiota in deoxygenated glycerol buffer maintains the microbiome cultivability and functional activity.

In summary, this study combines an ex vivo microbiome assay and metaproteomics to rapidly evaluate the impacts of freezing and delayed sample processing on the cultivability and functional activity of individual microbiome. We showed that the fecal microbiome is stable in deoxygenated buffer with preservant, such as glycerol, on ice for 48 hours, allowing for off-site sample collection and standard two-day shipping to the laboratory. We also demonstrated that freezing the microbiomes at −80°C for one year has minimal detrimental effects on the cultivability of microbiomes and functional responses to treatment with FOS, although changes on some bacterial species, such as those in Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria, can be observed in some individual microbiomes. It remains to be studied whether freezing for longer than one year and/or at lower temperature (e.g., liquid nitrogen) affects the functionality of biobanked microbiome. Nevertheless, we recommend that for live microbiota biobanking: 1) fecal samples need to be collected using a deoxygenated buffer with preservant, 2) immediately placed on ice and transferred to the facility within 48 hours, and 3) processed in anaerobic conditions upon reception for biobanking. Our results also suggest that each microbiome needs to be evaluated for its functionality prior to usage for microbiome assay or transplantation.

The protocol for human stool sample collection (# 20160585–01 H) was approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board at the Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Canada. Four healthy volunteers (V31, V33, V34 and V51, with age of 34, 31, 48, and 49 years old, respectively; two men and two women) were recruited for stool sample collection. Exclusion criteria for participation included the presence of irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, or diabetes diagnosis; antibiotic use or gastroenteritis episode in three months preceding collection; use of pro-/pre-biotic, laxative, or anti-diarrheal drugs in the last month preceding collection; or pregnancy. Approximately 8 g of fresh stools were collected from the volunteers and were immediately kept on dry ice or immersed in 20 mL pre-reduced deoxygenated preservation buffer in 50 mL sterile conical centrifuge tubes. The deoxygenated preservation buffer was prepared with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.6) with a final concentration of 10% (v/v) glycerol and 0.1% (w/v) L-cysteine hydrochloride. Prior to usage, the preservation buffer was stored in anaerobic workstation (5% H2, 5% CO2, and 90% N2) for overnight with the lid open for gas exchange.

For the first experiment to evaluate the effects of freezing, stools that were kept in deoxygenated preservation buffer were immediately transferred to anaerobic workstation and homogenized to make a 20% (w/v) fecal slurry by adding additional pre-reduced deoxygenated preservation buffer followed by filtering using sterile gauzes to remove large particles. A minimum of eight aliquots were generated for each microbiome. One aliquot was directly used for RapidAIM culturing (see details below), and the other aliquots were stored in −80°C for future use at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 52 weeks, respectively. For the second experiment to evaluate the effects of stool transportation on dry ice, stools were kept on dry ice or in deoxygenated preservation buffer on ice for 6 hours. After that, both stool samples were transferred to anaerobic workstation for processing to make a 20% (w/v) fecal slurry as described above. Both samples were then used as inoculum directly for RapidAIM culturing (see details below). For the third experiment to evaluate the effects of delayed sample processing, approximately 8 g of fresh stools were kept in 20 mL deoxygenated preservation buffer in 50 mL sterile conical centrifuge tubes and stored on ice for 24 or 48 hours prior to sample preprocessing and RapidAIM culturing as described above.

RapidAIM culturing was performed with a 96-well plate and optimized gut microbiota culture medium as described previously.11 The culture medium was composed of 2.0 g L−1 peptone water, 2.0 g L−1 yeast extract, 0.5 g L−1 L-cysteine hydrochloride, 2 mL L−1 Tween 80, 5 mg L−1 hemin, 5 μL L−1 vitamin K1, 1.0 g L−1NaCl, 0.4 g L−1 K2HPO4, 0.4 g L−1 KH2PO4, 0.1 g L−1 MgSO4 · 7H2O, 0.1 g L−1 CaCl2 · 2H2O, 4.0 g L−1NaHCO3, 4.0 g L−1 porcine gastric mucin, 0.25 g L−1 sodium cholate, and 0.25 g L−1 sodium chenodeoxycholate. The culture medium was equilibrated in anaerobic workstation overnight before use. Fresh fecal slurry was inoculated into 1 ml microbiota culture medium at a final fecal concentration of 2% (w/v), while frozen fecal slurry was thawed at 37°C with thorough shaking prior to inoculation. FOS was added at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml and PBS (pH 7.6) was added as vehicle control at the same volume of FOS. Following the addition of inoculums, FOS or PBS, the plates were covered with vented sterile silicone mats and shaken at 500 rpm at 37°C for 24 hours in the anaerobic workstation. Baseline samples were collected from the culturing plate after a brief shaking for 2 min after inoculation of microbiota.

Fifty micrograms of proteins of each sample were used for in-solution trypsin digestion as described previously.38 Briefly, the proteins were first reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 56°C for 30 min and alkylated in the dark with 20 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) at room temperature for 45 min. Then the lysates were diluted using 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate to reduce the concentration of urea to less than 1 M. One μg of trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) and the tryptic digestion was performed at 37°C overnight with agitation. The tryptic peptides were then purified using a 10-μm C18 column and eluted with 80% acetonitrile (v/v)/0.1% formic acid (v/v). After evaporation, the tryptic peptides were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid (v/v) for MS analysis.

Tryptic peptides were analyzed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.) coupled with a high-performance liquid chromatography. The separation of peptides was performed on an analytical column (75 μm × 50 cm) packed with reverse phase beads (1.9 μm; 120-Å pore size) with 2-hour gradient from 5 to 35% acetonitrile (v/v) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The MS method consisted of one full MS scan from 300 to 1800 m/z followed by data-dependent MS/MS scan of the 12 most intense ions. A dynamic exclusion repeat count was set to 2, and the repeat exclusion duration to 30s. All data were recorded by Xcalibur version 4.3 and exported into RAW format for further peptide/protein identification and quantification.

Since the experiments in this study span for around 1 year, the samples were run on MS at different batches. To monitor the performance and consistency of MS measurement, a quality control (QC) sample was prepared by randomly mixing 10 samples and aliquoted for MS run at each batch of MS measurement.

All MS raw files were subjected to data processing using MetaLab (version 1.2), a bioinformatic tool for automated and comprehensive metaproteomic data analysis.39 Briefly, peptides and proteins were identified and quantified using the MetaPro-IQ workflow.40 To generate a reduced database, redundant spectra were removed using a spectral clustering strategy and the resulting clustered spectra were then searched against the human gut microbial gene catalog database (containing 9.9 million microbial genes).41 All matched proteins were then extracted, and their sequences were compiled as a database for a second step target-decoy database search with a strict filtering of the peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) based on a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01. Relative abundances of identified protein groups were quantified using label-free quantification (LFQ) with maxLFQ algorithm.42 Taxonomic annotation of all identified peptide sequences was performed using a built-in pep2tax database as described previously.39 The identified taxa were then quantified using the intensities of corresponding distinctive peptides and were analyzed at different taxonomic rank levels separately. Identified protein groups were then subjected for functional annotation using eggNOG-mapper.43 In this study, Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) and COG category were used for functional analyses. Relative abundances of a COG or COG category were derived by summing the LFQ intensities of all protein groups that were annotated as that COG or COG category.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed in R (version 4.0.2) using the function prcomp and visualized using autoplot function. To do PCA analysis, quantified protein groups or COGs were first filtered using a criterion of an appearance of non-zero data in ≥ 50% samples; the intensities of the remaining protein groups or COGs were then log10-transformed, and the missing values were imputed using K-nearest neighbors algorithm in R with the function kNN. Taxonomic compositions at phylum or genus level were visualized using a stacked bar plot with ggplot2. Box plots were generated using ggplot2 as well.
