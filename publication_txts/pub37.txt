Dry and Rainy Seasons Significantly Alter the Gut Microbiome Composition and Reveal a Key Enterococcus sp. (Lactobacillales: Enterococcaceae) Core Component in Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Corn Strain From Northwestern Colombia



Spodoptera frugiperda is a polyphagous pest of several crops of economic importance. Nowadays, the insect is broadly distributed in America and, recently, in Africa, Asia, and Australia. The species has diverged into corn and rice strains. The role of the gut microbiota in insect physiology is relevant due to its participation in crucial functions. However, knowledge of seasonal variations that alter the gut microbiome in pests is limited. Gut microbiome composition between the dry and rainy seasons was analyzed with cultured and uncultured approaches in S. frugiperda corn strain larvae collected at Northwest Colombia, as seasonal microbiome changes might fluctuate due to environmental changes. On the basis of culture-dependent methods, results show well-defined microbiota with bacterial isolates belonging to Enterococcus, Klebsiella (Enterobacteriales: Enterobacteriaceae), Enterobacter (Enterobacterales: Enterobacteriaceae), and Bacillus (Bacillales: Bacillaceae) genera. The community composition displayed a low bacterial diversity across all samples. The core community detected with uncultured methods was composed of Enterococcus, Erysipelatoclostridium (Erysipelotrichales: Erysipelotrichaceae), Rasltonia (Burkholderiales: Burkholderiaceae), and Rhizobium (Hyphomicrobiales: Rhizobiaceae) genera, and Enterobacteriaceae family members. Significant differences in microbiome diversity were observed between the two seasons. The relative abundance of Erysipelatoclostridium was high in the dry season, while in the phylotype ZOR0006 (Erysipelotrichales: Erysipelotrichaceae) and Tyzzerella (Lachnospirales: Lachnospiraceae) genus, the relative abundance was high in the rainy season. The overall low gut bacterial diversity observed in the S. frugiperda corn strain suggests a strong presence of antagonist activity as a selection factor possibly arising from the host, the dominant bacterial types, or the material ingested. Targeting the stability and predominance of this core microbiome could be an additional alternative to pest control strategies, particularly in this moth.

The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), is a tropical insect considered an important pest in all Western Hemisphere (López-Edwards et al. 1999, Cano-Calle et al. 2015). The species has been reported in West and Central Africa in corn crops from contaminated material of corn from the eastern United States and the Greater Antilles (Nagoshi et al. 2017), and it has also been recently found in Asia and Australia (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] 2020, Nagoshi et al. 2020, Piggott et al. 2021). In Colombia, S. frugiperda is recognized as a primary pest of corn (Zea mays), and a secondary pest in sorghum (Sorghum spp.), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), and pasture grasses (Garcia et al. 2002). Since 1986, S. frugiperda was molecularly classified into two strains associated with its main host plants: corn and rice (Pashley and Martin 1987, Prowell et al. 2004). These two strains have also been widely reported in the United States (Nagoshi and Meagher 2004), México (Pecina-Quintero et al. 2015, Rosas-García et al. 2016), Argentina (Juárez et al. 2012, Murúa et al. 2015), and Brazil (Busato et al. 2004). Recently, the insect has also been reported in few countries of Africa (Goergen et al. 2016) and Asia (Nagoshi et al. 2020).

Seasonal changes in gut microbiota have been widely observed in humans, as its composition depends on host genetic background, lifestyle, and environmental factors (Koliada et al. 2020); these changes were also observed in the gut of the horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) (Xiao et al. 2019), microbiota of different mulberry (Morus L.) cultivars (Ou et al. 2019), and mosquito microbiota (Anopheles coluzzii) (Krajacich et al. 2018), among others. However, this sort of study has never been made in S. frugiperda; for this reason, an analysis of the gut microbiome composition in the corn strain from larvae collected in cornfields at the Department of Antioquia (Colombia) was made to determine the predominant key members of its intestinal microbiota and the effect of seasonal differences and environmental temperature conditions on the gut microbiome. The results obtained here are relevant for the management of this pest as the microbiome plays a crucial role in insect physiology.

Sample collection was performed following the parameters of Colombian decree N° 1376. No specific permits were required for this study. Spodoptera larvae were collected from a private property and permission was received from the landowners before sampling.

Individuals of S. frugiperda larvae (third to the fourth instar) were obtained from a cornfield at the Estación Agraria ‘Cotove’ farm, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, located at the Santa Fe de Antioquia (6°31′54.0′N, 75°49′33.8′W) in Antioquia Department, Colombia. One hundred fifty larvae were collected in 2017 during March (dry season = season 1) and October (rainy season = season 2). After sampling, larvae were individually separated in small plastic containers under aerial conditions and with corn leaves and transported to the laboratory. All larvae were kept alive until processing.

To reduce vital functions, larvae were cooled at −20°C for 10 min. Later on, they were first washed with ethanol (70%) and then with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) + Tween-20 solution (1%). Gravimetric data were taken from each processed larva. Dissections were performed using sterile forceps in PBS 1× buffer. The entire gastrointestinal tract was extracted, weighed, measured, and macerated in sterile PBS 1×. Each intestinal homogenate was preserved and processed at low temperatures. Half of the homogenate was used for conventional culture-based microbiological methods and the other half was frozen and used for the culture-independent molecular approaches (Yun et al. 2014, Vivero et al. 2016).

To determine and confirm S. frugiperda host strains in the cornfields where the larvae were collected, genotyping was performed on larvae heads by using PCR-RFLP of the COI gene at the mitochondrial DNA and PCR for nuclear region FR (Cano-Calle et al. 2015). PCR amplification of genomic DNA was performed using JM76 forward (5′-GAGCTGAATTAGG(G/A)ACTCCAGG-3′) and JM77 reverse (5′-ATCACCTCC (A/T)CCTGCAGGATC-3′) primers. After the PCR reaction, digestion was performed using the restriction enzyme MspI. All samples were visualized on agarose gel at 2% (Vélez Arango et al. 2008).

For the FR region amplification, PCR reactions were performed using FR-a forward (5′-TTTTACACCGGTCACAACGA-3′) and FR-2 reverse (5′-GACATAGAAGAGCACGTTT-3′) primers. The rice strain pattern produces electrophoretic bands >500 bp, whereas the corn strain pattern produces no bands or one to three faint bands (Nagoshi and Meagher 2003, Vélez Arango et al. 2008, Cano-Calle et al. 2015).

The homogenates were serially diluted (up to 106) on Nutritional Agar (Merck, Germany) and MacConkey Agar (up to 106). The plates were incubated aerobically at 37°C for 24 h (Vivero et al. 2016). After incubation, the total number of colony-forming units (CFU) per gram of each homogenate was determined. Representative morphotypes were isolated and characterized at the microscopic and macroscopic levels, and the isolates were conserved in 20% v/v glycerol at −80°C. Pure isolates were molecularly characterized by the Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (RISA) and the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene (Vivero et al. 2016).

DNA taken from the isolates was extracted using thermal lysis. PCR amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (RISA) was performed using the L1 and G1 primers and the mix reaction, and the program was used as previously reported (Jensen et al. 1993). The gels were stained with AgNO3 (Amresco, Solon, Ohio) and analyzed using the GelCompar II program (Applied Maths Biosystems, Kortrijk, Belgium). ITS cluster analysis was performed using the Pearson coefficient and Simple Linkage cluster method. Seventy-five percent or more similarity between ITS standards was established as criteria for subsequent molecular identification.

To identify the bacterial isolates, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with the universal primers Eubac 27 and 1492R (Moreno et al. 2002). Amplicons were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced in both directions using the ABI PRISM 3700 Genetic Analyzer (Vivero et al. 2016).

The total genomic DNA was extracted and purified from homogenized tissue using ‘FastDNA SPIN KIT’ (Mp Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). The DNA integrity and concentration were analyzed as described previously (Montoya-Porras et al. 2018).

The DNA samples were used for 16S rDNA amplification between the V3 and V6 regions (566 bp) using 341F-GC domains and 907R primers (Muyzer et al. 1993). PCR reactions were performed as previously described by Gomez et al. (2011). PCR products were concentrated using a concentrator (Eppendorf 5301) and dissolved in ultrapure water. The PCR products (600 ng) were run on 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide–7 M urea gel in 1.25× TAE buffer with a temperature gradient of 66–69°C, and a ramp of 0.2°C/h for 15 h at 55 V in a DCode system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Furthermore, two reference markers of the 100 bp ladder (Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc., Carlsbad, CA, n.d.) and a pool of 16S rDNA fragments of two reference bacterial strains (Escherichia coli (Enterobacteriales: Proteobacteria) ATCC 8739 TM and Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 TM) were used. Polyacrylamide gels were stained and analyzed using the GelCompar II software (Applied Maths Biosystems, Kortrijk, Belgium) (Rademaker and De Bruijn 1997). The cluster analysis was performed using the Pearson correlation and Complete Linkage method (Koeppel et al. 2008). Bands of interest were excised, and the DNA was eluted. The eluent DNA was used to perform the re-amplification with the 341F and 907R primers. The amplification products were purified and later sequenced. Additional analyses were performed for the isolate sequences re-using the methods described above.

The sequences that were obtained from the PCR of the 16 rDNA from the isolates and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) eluted bands were edited using the BioEdit program (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html) and CHIMERA CHECK software (http://www.bioinformatics-toolkit.org). We used a Basic alignment search tool (BLAST) (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to compare the edited sequences and SeqMatch search tool from the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/seqmatch), downloaded reference and consensus sequences were aligned using Clustal W (Thompson et al. 1994) with MEGA7 (https://www.megasoftware.net) (Kumar et al. 2016) and the same program was used to construct a Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree with bootstrapping. The sequences obtained here can be found in the NCBI GenBank databases with accession numbers SUB5452002 for isolates and SUB7508707 for TGGE eluted bands.

16S rRNA gene amplicons were obtained from the total DNA extractions and sequenced using the MiSeq Illumina platform. Alpha and beta diversity were estimated based on 97% similarity Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUS) using the QIIME 1.9.1 package (Kuczynski et al. 2011) using the pipeline as described by García-Bonilla et al. (2019). Variations in the relative abundance of OTUs in the respective seasonal conditions were tested for significance using the Kruskal–Wallis test. Phyloseq R 1.5.21 package was used for extracting graphic outputs (Pérez-Jaramillo et al. 2017).

COI amplification of mitochondrial DNA and its subsequent digestion with the MspI enzyme allowed us to identify 27 individuals as the corn strain and one hybrid between the two strains (sample A205). This was confirmed using the amplification of the nuclear region FR (Supp Material 1 [online only]).

Gut bacterial counts of S. frugiperda ranged from 6.4 log (CFU/g) (MacConkey Agar) to 7.4 log (CFU/g) (Nutritional Agar) in the first collection season, while CFU counts for the second season increased from 6 log (CFU/g) (McConkey Agar) to 27 log (CFU/g) (Nutritional Agar) (Supp Material 2 [online only]).

A total of 72 isolates were purified from both culture media, where differences were observed according to the parameters such as Gram staining and colony morphology after performing a macro- and microscopic characterization of each isolate. Fifty-seven percent of the isolates corresponded to Gram-positive bacteria, while 39% are Gram-negative bacteria, and only the remaining 4% were Gram-indeterminate bacteria.

The dendrogram based on ITS isolated patterns analyzed with GelCompar II differentiated 12 clusters with a similarity percentage of 75% (Supp Material 3 [online only]). Representative isolates of each cluster were further selected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Twenty-two total sequences obtained from RISA isolate clusters were phylogenetically analyzed using NJ tree. The percentages of similarity between our isolates and reference sequences were between 98 and 100% (sequenced and cured fragments that were on average 1.000 bp). Isolates were related to the genera Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Bacillus, suggesting a predominance of Firmicutes phylum in the S. frugiperda gut corn strain (Table 1).

Twenty-eight intestinal samples (including 14 gut samples from the dependent culture methods) were subjected to total DNA extraction and further results were obtained using the TGGE technique, which separated 16S rRNA gene fragments of a size equivalent to 585 bp. These fragments showed differences in the banding patterns, suggesting some bacterial diversity (Fig. 1).

Thirty-three bands with unique migration patterns and higher intensity were split, re-amplified, and sent to sequencing. From all sequences obtained, seven of them were successfully edited and correctly aligned with sequences related to the genus Klebsiella (NR_025635.1 Klebsiella variicola), Enterococcus (NR_113906.1 Enterococcus mundtii), and Enterobacter (NR_126208.1 Enterobacter xiangfangensis) (Fig. 2).

After filtering and cleaning the raw data for low-quality or chimeric sequences, the resulting dataset had read 250 nucleotides on average, consisting of 391.087 reads grouped into 7.093 OTUs with 97% similarity for all 11 samples analyzed. The median value in the clean datasets is 35.640 ± 4.338 reads per sample. Rarefaction analysis (Supp Material 4 [online only]) showed that the sequence coverage was more than 97% for all samples analyzed, signifying that the patterns of composition are representative of amplicon complexity and samples can be compared regarding alpha and beta diversity on specimens of S. frugiperda corn strain. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla in all samples, where Firmicutes corresponded in most cases to 90% of the total bacterial community present, except for the A208 sample where phylum Proteobacteria accounts for 53% of the total community. Enterococcus was the most abundant genus in all samples (85–90%), except the sample A86 where Erysipelatoclostridium was the most abundant with almost 55% of the total community, communities grouped as ‘rest of the community’ corresponded to genera with less than 1% relative abundance within the total. A difference is observed for the collection season within the core community, where the genus Erysipelatoclostridium was more abundant in the dry season (season 1) of collection, decaying its abundance in the following season, whereas the ribotype from Firmicutes strain ZOR006 increased in the rainy season (season 2) as well as the genus Tyzerella 3 (Figs. 3 and
4). Differences in the bacterial community composition were also observed in weighted and unweighted Unifrac distances showing a closer clustering of samples from the dry season. Although there is some similarity between the samples analyzed, samples from the rainy season are rather scattered across the dendrogram topology, indicating more variability in low-frequency OTUs (Supp Material 5 [online only]). Regarding S. frugiperda corn strain gut bacterial diversity, the alpha diversity indices were not significant since their box plot bars overlap, particularly Shannon and Simpson diversity indices. The values did not differ significantly between the diversity indices (P value: 0.44, Kruskal–Wallis test). The observed richness is greater in the dry collection season (season 1) (Fig. 4). The constrained analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed a well-defined clustering of bacterial communities, indicating that an estimated 30% of the differences observed was influenced due to seasonal conditions (dry vs rainy) (Fig. 5).

Nowadays, studies of intestinal microbiota associated with insects are a growing field of interest as new alternatives to find microorganisms and/or molecules for improving the biological control for pest management (Almeida et al. 2017, Orozco-Flores et al. 2017), especially for species that are difficult to control such as S. frugiperda. This moth represents an important corn pest worldwide (Nagoshi et al. 2020). The species has diverged into corn and rice strains that have genetically differentiated, and in Colombia, they have evolved reproductive isolation at pre- and postzygotic levels (Velasquez-Velez et al. 2011). These two strains are genetically differentiated with reduced gene flow in Colombia (Cano-Calle et al. 2015). In this country, they also differ in wing morphometrics (Cañas-Hoyos et al. 2014) and exhibit differences in resistance to insecticides and Bacillus thuringiensis endotoxins (Ríos-Díez and Saldamando-Benjumea 2011, Ríos-Díez et al. 2012). In this study, strain identification was performed on field-collected S. frugiperda corn strain specimens in Colombia (South America), and also a variation in the gut microbiome composition between the dry and rainy seasons was examined over the course of 1 yr in larvae collected from cornfields. Results obtained here corroborated the presence of the corn strain in 27 samples and a hybrid between both strains (sample ‘A205’) (Cano-Calle et al. 2015), and previous studies have shown that the probability of the presence of this individual in corn crops is low, but due to its polyphagous nature, it can be found in a small proportion (Vélez Arango et al. 2008, Cano-Calle et al. 2015). Crosses between corn strain females with rice strain males are restricted in the laboratory. However, in nature, hybrids between rice strain females and corn strain males can be found in low proportions in the field (Velasquez-Velez et al. 2011). In Colombia, Cañas-Hoyos et al. (2017) demonstrated that both strains differ in the volatile composition produced by their females, and thus the production of hybrids in nature is limited due to the assortative mating between the strains.

In conclusion, our study found an overall low bacterial diversity in the intestine of S. frugiperda. However, the most important result observed in the S. frugiperda corn strain was the seasonal variation of gut microbiota due to temperature variations and rainfall. These results were obtained from a larval collection where these two variables had a direct effect on the relative abundance of bacterial communities present in the intestine of S. frugiperda and particularly in the relative abundance of Erysipelatoclostridium, phylotype ZOR0006 (Erysipelotrichaceae), and Tyzerella sp. as Erysipelatoclostridium was more abundant in the dry collecting season, while the phylotype ZOR0006 (Erysipelotrichaceae) and Tyzerella sp. were more abundant in the rainy season. In general, our study enriches our knowledge on the microbiome associated with S. frugiperda and will provide clues to develop potential biocontrol techniques against this corn pest, particularly it provides evidence of the relevance of seasonal changes in microbiota composition in insects for their biological control.
