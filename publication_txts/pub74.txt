Metabolic protection by the dietary flavonoid 7,8-dihydroxyflavone requires an intact gut microbiome



7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF) is a naturally occurring flavonoid found in Godmania, Tridax, and Primula species that confers protection against high-fat diet (HFD) induced metabolic pathologies selectively in female mice. We have previously reported that this metabolic protection is associated with early and stable remodeling of the intestinal microbiome, evident in female but not male DHF-supplemented mice. Early changes in the gut microbiome in female DHF-fed mice were highly predictive of subsequent metabolic protection, suggesting a causative association between the gut microbiome and the metabolic effects of DHF.

To investigate a causal association between the gut microbiome and the metabolic effects of DHF using a model of antibiotic-induced gut microbiome ablation.

Age-matched male and female C57Bl6/J mice were given ad libitum access to HFD and drinking water containing vehicle or DHF for 12 weeks. For antibiotic (Abx) treatment, female mice were given drinking water containing a cocktail of antibiotics for 2 weeks prior to HFD feeding and throughout the feeding period. Metabolic phenotyping consisted of longitudinal assessments of body weights, body composition, food, and water intake, as well as measurement of energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, and plasma and hepatic lipids. Protein markers mediating the cellular effects of DHF were assessed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and skeletal muscle.

Metabolic protection conferred by DHF in female HFD-fed mice was only apparent in the presence of an intact gut microbiome. Abx-treated mice were not protected from HFD-induced obesity by DHF administration. Further, tissue activation of the tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) receptor, which has been attributed to the biological activity of DHF, was lost upon gut microbiome ablation, indicating a requirement for microbial “activation” of DHF for its systemic effects. In addition, we report for the first time that DHF supplementation significantly activates TrkB in BAT of female, but not male, mice uncovering a novel target tissue of DHF. DHF supplementation also increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) protein in BAT, consistent with protection from diet-induced obesity.

These results establish for the first time a requirement for the gut microbiome in mediating the metabolic effects of DHF in female mice and uncover a novel target tissue that may mediate these sexually-dimorphic protective effects.

Dietary flavonoids are non-nutritive bioactive compounds associated with reduced risk for developing numerous pathologies, including obesity, and associated chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and gastrointestinal disorders (1–4). Flavonoids are poorly absorbed in the upper GI tract, and thus spend a considerable amount of time in the lower GI tract and colon, where their interactions with and biotransformation by gut microbiota (5, 6) are thought to mediate some of their subsequent systemic effects (7).

Given the association between gut microbial changes and body weight, we explored the question of whether the gut microbiome may play a causal role in the metabolic effects attributed to oral DHF. Using a model of antibiotic-mediated gut microbiome ablation, we report here that an intact intestinal microbiome is required to mediate both the cellular signaling and metabolic protection elicited by oral DHF in female mice.

Age-matched male and female C57Bl6/J mice were used in all studies. 13-week old mice were given ad libitum access to a HFD (Research Diets D12451; 45% kcals fat, 20% kcals protein, 35% kcals carbohydrate; 5.8% fiber; 4.7 kcal/g metabolizable energy) and drinking water containing vehicle or 1 mg/mL DHF for 12-weeks. Water preparation for the conventional non-antibiotic treated group was as reported previously (38). For antibiotic (Abx) treatment, 11-week old female mice were given drinking water containing a cocktail of Abx including ampicillin (1 g/L), neomycin (1 g/L), metronidazole (1 g/L) (all from Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States) and vancomycin (VWR Radnor, PA, United States) (0.5 g/L) in 1% sucrose and 0.17% DMSO in PBS for 2 weeks prior to HFD feeding. Bacterial ablation was confirmed as described below. Following this, mice were randomly assigned to Abx-control or Abx-DHF groups and received Abx throughout the 12-week HFD-feeding.

Body weights and food intake were measured weekly, and water intake was measured twice a week (38). Body composition was determined by NMR (Echo MRI, Columbus, OH, United States), at the start and end of HFD-feeding (38). The breeding and care of the animals were in accordance with the protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey. For in vivo procedures, all efforts were made to minimize discomfort and suffering, in accordance with approved animal care protocols. Following 12 weeks of feeding, mice were euthanized by isoflurane overdose, followed by cardiac exsanguination. Tissues were rapidly collected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until further analyses.

Fresh fecal pellets were collected before and after 2 weeks of Abx-treatment and after 1, 6, and 12 weeks of HFD-feeding and stored at −80°C until further analysis. Fecal bacterial DNA was isolated using QIAamp DNA stool mini kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, United States) following manufacturer’s instructions. Total fecal 16S rRNA was quantified by qPCR using forward primer 785F: 5′-GGA TTA GAT ACC CTG GTA and reverse primer 907R: 5′-CCG TCA ATT CCT TTR AGT TT, spanning the V5 region of 16S rRNA gene (40). A 16S rRNA plasmid DNA with known copy number was used to generate a standard curve to quantify bacterial DNA in samples, as previously described (40).

Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry (Oxymax, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) after 8 weeks of feeding, as previously described (41). Briefly, oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were determined in individually housed animals with ad libitum access to HFD and water; both DHF and Abx were maintained in drinking water of respective groups during the calorimetry studies. Animals were acclimatized to Oxymax chambers for 24 h, and VO2 and VCO2 were recorded for eight consecutive 12-h light and 12-h dark cycles. Metabolic variables were recorded every minute, with a room air reference taken following each cycle of measurements.

Oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed after 10 weeks of HFD-feeding. Briefly, mice were fasted for 4 h, followed by oral gavage of 20% dextrose at a dose of 1 g/kg body weight. Blood was collected from the tail at 0, 20, 40, 90, and 120 min for assessment of plasma glucose using an Accu-Chek glucometer (Accu-Chek Performa, Roche Diagnostics, IN, United States).

Plasma free cholesterol was measured using the Wako Free Cholesterol E Microtiter kit, as per manufacturer’s instructions (FUJIFILM Healthcare, Lexington, MA, United States). Hepatic lipids were extracted by a modified Folch method and separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), as previously described (42). Briefly, 20 mg liver tissue was homogenized in chloroform:methanol (2:1), followed by phase separation by the addition of acidified saline and centrifugation. The organic phase was collected, dried under a nitrogen stream, reconstituted in chloroform:methanol (2:1), spotted onto Silica Gel 60 chromatography plates, and developed in heptane:isopropyl ether:acetic acid (60:40:3) until the solvent front reached 1 cm from the top of the plate. Plates were dried, dipped in 10% copper sulfate in 10% phosphoric acid, and charred at 110°C for 30 min.

Protein samples were prepared by homogenizing tissues in HEPES lysis buffer (50 mM pH 7.4 HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na-pyrophosphate, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 10% Glycerol) containing 1x protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred on PVDF membranes, and immunoblotted with primary antibodies. Primary antibodies including PGC-1α (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, United States), VDAC (Pierce Biotechnology, Waltham, MA, United States), UCP1, COX-IV (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), and Total TrkB, P-TrkB, PAMPK, Total AMPK, HSP60, SIRT1, and GAPDH (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, United States) were used at manufacturer recommended dilutions. Following incubation with HRP- or near-IR dye-conjugated secondary antibodies, membranes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence or near-IR imaging on an Azure c600 imaging system (Azure Biosystems, United States) and quantified using ImageStudio Lite.

All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis are carried out using student’s t- test for two group comparisons or, for multi-group comparisons using one-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc analysis (Bonferroni) in Graph Pad Prism (version 9.3.1 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, United States). p-values < 0.05 were considered significant.

We previously reported that mice supplemented with oral DHF for 12 weeks accumulated differential amounts of body weight and fat mass on a high-fat diet (HFD), dependent on sex. Female mice gained significantly less weight and adiposity when supplemented with oral DHF, but male mice were resistant to this metabolic protection afforded by DHF supplementation. We also reported that DHF-induced early and stable remodeling of the gut microbiome in female but not male mice, corresponding with metabolic protection or lack thereof, upon DHF supplementation (38).

Gut microbiome ablation has been previously reported to significantly increase cecal weights (52–54). These results were recapitulated in the current study, and DHF did not induce any additional effects on cecal weights (Figure 1F).

Plasma cholesterol was significantly reduced by DHF in the conventional group (Figure 2A). Abx-treatment alone did not reduce plasma cholesterol levels. Importantly, DHF treatment in the Abx-group had no impact on plasma cholesterol, unlike in the conventional group (Figure 2A). Hepatic lipid accumulation was measured by thin-layer chromatography and revealed a significant reduction in levels of diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesterol esters (CE) in DHF-treated females (Figures 2B,C). However, Abx-DHF animals had no significant reductions in hepatic lipids, relative to Abx-controls. Taken together, these data indicate that reductions in plasma and hepatic lipids by DHF administration require an intact gut microbiome.

To examine the mechanisms of protection from HFD-induced obesity in DHF-fed females, energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry after 8 weeks of HFD-feeding. Significant increases in O2 consumption and CO2 respiration were observed in conventionally-raised female DHF-fed mice (Figures 3A,B). Similar increases were not apparent in Abx-treated DHF-fed females (Figures 3C,D). Similarly, regression of energy expenditure against body weight indicated a steeper regression slope in DHF-fed females, relative to control females (Figure 3E; slope: 0.0070 for Control vs. 0.0179 for DHF females) in the conventionally-raised mice, although this difference was not statistically significant. However, this same trend was not observed for DHF-fed females following Abx-treatment (Figure 3F; slope: 0.0011 for Abx-Control vs. 0.0035 for Abx-DHF). We interpret these data to collectively indicate a modest increase in energy expenditure upon DHF supplementation, which is lost in Abx-treated mice. These data are consistent with the protection from weight gain observed in DHF-fed females and lack of protection upon Abx-treatment (Figure 1A) and point to an important role for the gut microbiome in mediating DHF-induced alterations in energy balance.

Consistent with obesity resistance, DHF supplementation of conventional females ameliorated glucose tolerance relative to control females (Figure 3G). Abx-treatment resulted in lower glucose area under the curve (AUC) relative to conventional controls, possibly due to the reduced weight gain in these mice. However, DHF treatment did not improve glucose tolerance in Abx-treated mice, consistent with body weight changes and further implicating a role for the gut microbiome in mediating the improvements in glucose tolerance upon DHF supplementation (Figures 3H,I).

7,8-dihydroxyflavone is an activator of tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) which is activated by phosphorylation at discrete tyrosine residues. We measured activation of TrkB by DHF in both male and female mice (32, 34). A previous study reported that oral DHF increased skeletal TrkB phosphorylation in female mice, without any report on the effects of DHF in males (39). Apart from the brain, peripheral expression of TrkB was reported to be greatest in brown and white adipose tissues, with very low expression reported in liver or skeletal muscle (53). Since brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a critical role in maintaining energy homeostasis, we focused our current investigations on this tissue. Given the prior report on the role of DHF in activating energy expenditure in skeletal muscle, we also investigated the impact of Abx and DHF in gastrocnemius tissue.

We next examined these markers in Abx-treated females. Interestingly, upon Abx-treatment, no induction of any of these markers was apparent in either BAT (Figures 6A,B) or gastrocnemius (Figures 7A,B) of female mice. Phosphorylation of TrkB and AMPK, and expression of UCP1, SIRT1, and PGC-1a were static across control and DHF-treated mice upon Abx-treatment. These data clearly indicate, for the first time, that an intact gut microbiome is necessary for induction of TrkB as well as for downstream cellular signaling by DHF.

7,8-dihydroxyflavone is a mimetic of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (31–33, 53–57). Like BDNF, DHF induces dimerization of the tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB), followed by activation of downstream signaling molecules, including AKT and ERK (31–33, 39, 53–55, 57–60). However, compared to BDNF, DHF has a much longer half-life of approximately 4-8 h in vivo in a primate model (56), compared to just 10 minutes for BDNF (61). This, combined with its shelf-stability and smaller molecular size, make DHF an attractive candidate for clinical applications and oral therapies (31–33, 56, 59, 61–63). Given its actions as a TrkB agonist, many studies regarding DHF have investigated its potential central effects and demonstrated promising results for its use as an antidepressant and neuroprotective factor (34, 36, 58, 64–66) despite known peripheral expression of TrkB receptors in metabolically active tissues (67–69). Furthermore, the prior literature regarding the use of DHF for attenuation of depression and cognitive decline has been carried out almost exclusively in male animals (34, 36, 58, 64–66).

Understanding sexual dimorphism in both gut microbiome composition, as well as response to dietary polyphenols is of great translational relevance. For instance, clinical studies frequently report greater levels of weight loss in male subjects upon dietary and lifestyle interventions relative to female subjects (115–117). Indeed, similar results were observed in placebo-treated subjects in a recent report that examined the combined impact of probiotic therapy with caloric restriction on weight loss. However, upon supplementation with an oral probiotic, weight loss was significantly enhanced in female but not male subjects (118), lending support to the idea that the gut microbiome may differentially impact health in males vs. females. Further studies that examine sexually-dimorphic responses to gut microbiome manipulation will therefore be crucial for the development of personalized nutrition strategies for combating metabolic diseases.
