Alterations in Gut Microbiome Composition and Barrier Function Are Associated with Reproductive and Metabolic Defects in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): A Pilot Study

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common female endocrinopathy of unclear origin characterized by hyperandrogenism, oligo-/anovulation, and ovarian cysts. Women with PCOS frequently display overweight, insulin resistance, and systemic low-grade inflammation. We hypothesized that endotoxemia resulting from a leaky gut is associated with inflammation, insulin resistance, fat accumulation, and hyperandrogenemia in PCOS. In this pilot study, we compared the stool microbiome, gut permeability, and inflammatory status of women with PCOS and healthy controls.

16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed on stool samples from 24 PCOS patients and 19 healthy controls. Data processing and microbiome analysis were conducted in mothur and QIIME using different relative abundance cut-offs. Gut barrier integrity, endotoxemia, and inflammatory status were evaluated using serum and stool markers and associations with reproductive, metabolic, and anthropometric parameters were investigated.

The stool microbiome of PCOS patients showed a lower diversity and an altered phylogenetic composition compared to controls. We did not observe significant differences in any taxa with a relative abundance>1%. When looking at rare taxa, the relative abundance of bacteria from the phylum Tenericutes, the order ML615J-28 (phylum Tenericutes) and the family S24-7 (phylum Bacteroidetes) was significantly lower and associated with reproductive parameters in PCOS patients. Patients showed alterations in some, but not all markers of gut barrier function and endotoxemia.

Patients with PCOS have a lower diversity and an altered phylogenetic profile in their stool microbiome, which is associated with clinical parameters. Gut barrier dysfunction and endotoxemia were not driving factors in this patient cohort, but may contribute to the clinical phenotype in certain PCOS patients.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine condition affecting women, which is characterized by androgen excess, oligo- or anovulation, and polycystic ovarian morphology. The reported worldwide prevalence of PCOS among women of reproductive age is 6–18% and varies due to the use of different diagnostic criteria, such as those issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) [1]. PCOS phenotypes can range from mild to severe and are often accompanied by disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism[1–3]. Women with PCOS have a higher prevalence of infertility, pregnancy complications, depression, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and the related long-term outcomes [3–6]. Additionally, PCOS patients display a heightened inflammatory state with increased circulating C-reactive protein [7]. The etiology of PCOS has not been fully explained, but is assumed to be multifactorial, comprising genetics, the intrauterine environment, and lifestyle factors [3].

Considering the unclear knowledge of the etiology of PCOS and new insights from recent human and animal microbiome studies, we sought to investigate the gut microbiome in PCOS to assess its relevance in this condition. We aimed to describe the members and composition of the stool bacterial microbiome in a pilot cohort of PCOS patients and healthy controls. To investigate the hypothesis that the gut microbiome is associated with glucose, lipid, and steroid hormone metabolism and the translocation of bacterial products across the intestinal barrier, we assessed markers for gut barrier integrity, endotoxemia, and inflammation.

A detailed description of the clinical and laboratory procedures can be found in S1 File. Detection limits and reliability indices of the used assays are provided in S1 Table.

25 women with PCOS and 25 hormonally healthy controls, all premenopausal, were recruited at the endocrinological outpatient clinic of the University Hospital Graz from June-December 2014. PCOS was diagnosed according to the Rotterdam Criteria after exclusion of related disorders [2]. Exclusion criteria were the use of antibiotics, hormonal contraceptives, or antidiabetic medication within the preceding three months, gastrointestinal disease, active infections, a body mass index (BMI)<18, and smoking. All study participants were at least 18 years old and provided written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University Graz.

Study visits took place in the morning after an overnight fast. Anthropometric data were recorded. Following a baseline blood sampling, a two-hour, 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT; glucose, insulin) was performed.

Stool samples were collected using empty stool collection tubes with an inbuilt spatula (Praxisdienst GmbH, Longuich, Germany). Samples were stored short-term at -20°C (mean±SD = 4±1.1 days) and then at -70°C until further processing. There was no follow-up visit.

Serum estrone (E1), 17-estradiol (E2), total testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry at the Department of Clinical Chemistry at the University Hospital of South Manchester, Manchester, UK, as described by Keevil et al. [22–25].

Raw data of anthropometric, laboratory, and FFQ measurements can be found in S3 File.

and overweight defined as a BMI≥25. The homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) index was calculated using the HOMA calculator V2.2.3 provided by the Diabetes Trial Unit, University of Oxford, UK (www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/, last accessed Dec 17, 2015) and insulin resistance defined as a HOMA2-IR≥2 [27]. The area under the curve (AUC) for glucose and insulin was calculated from the oGTT using the trapezoidal method. The free androgen index (FAI) was calculated according to the formula

Total testosterone (nmol/l)
SHBG (nmol/l)
. Free testosterone and free DHT were calculated from total testosterone/DHT and SHBG according to Mazer, assuming a blood albumin concentration of 6.2 μmol/l [28].

Total DNA was extracted from stool samples using the MagNA Pure LC DNA Isolation Kit III (Bacteria, Fungi) (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with additional bead-beating with MagNA Lyser Green Beads (Roche) and lysozyme treatment (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). One negative control consisting of 1x sterile phosphate buffered saline was included in each MagNA Pure run and subjected to all subsequent procedures.

Raw sequencing data are available in NCBI’s short read archive (SRA) under the accession number SRP077213.

Raw reads were processed using the open-source software mothur V1.35.0 according to a published protocol (accessed April 2015) [29]. Open reference operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking was performed in QIIME 1.8.0 using UCLUST against the greengenes 13.8 database [30–32]. An OTU was defined as a group of sequences with a similarity of 97% or more. Alpha rarefaction analyses were based on the number of observed OTUs and Faith’s phylogenetic diversity index and performed in QIIME. Principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) were based on unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances, calculated in QIIME, and plotted in GraphPad Prism 5 [33]. Taxa summaries were performed in QIIME. Three different OTU abundance cut-offs were tested to assess the impact of high- and low-abundance taxa and spurious OTUs resulting from sequencing errors. The cut-offs used were the removal of singleton OTUs, OTUs with a relative abundance <0.01%, and OTUs with a relative abundance <0.1%. Applying a relative abundance cut-off of 1% retained only 12 OTUs and was therefore deemed too strict.

The relative abundance of bacteria from the Tenericutes phylum was confirmed with real-time quantitative PCR using the primer set Ten662F and Ten862R, normalized to total 16S rRNA gene content using the primer set 926F and 1062R, as described by Yang et al. [34]. 20 ng DNA template were used in a 10 μl reaction on a LightCycler 480 Instrument (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The statistical methods used in QIIME were: Nonparametric student’s t-tests using Monte Carlo permutations for alpha diversity comparisons, Mann-Whitney U tests for taxa comparisons, and Adonis for category comparisons of distance matrices. Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing correction was used for taxa comparisons.

All remaining statistical calculations were performed in IBM SPSS Statistics Version 22. Parametric or non-parametric tests were chosen based on the distribution of each variable. Unpaired t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for continuous data and Fisher’s Exact tests for categorical data. For correlation analyses, Pearson’s r is reported for parametric and Spearman’s rho (ρ) for nonparametric variables. In the case of missing values, patients were excluded from analysis for that particular variable. All data are expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). A p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Of the 50 subjects included, all completed the baseline assessment and 49 returned a stool sample. Three controls were excluded due to previously undetected hyperandrogenemia, two subjects were excluded due to smoking, and one subject was excluded due to a BMI<18. The final analyses were performed with 20 healthy controls, of which 19 provided a stool sample, and 24 PCOS patients.

When classifying PCOS patients based on the four possible phenotypes under the Rotterdam Criteria, the majority (42%) of patients displayed the phenotype D (OA+PCOM), while 21 and 8% displayed the “classical” phenotypes A (OA+HA+PCOM) and B (OA+HA), respectively (Fig 1). Type C (HA+PCOM) was represented with a prevalence of 29%.

The total number of reads analyzed and OTUs identified at each cut-off level are presented in S2 Table. The number of reads analyzed did not differ between PCOS and control samples, indicating comparable and adequate sequencing coverage. As expected, applying relative abundance filters substantially reduced the number of observed OTUs while causing only a modest decrease in the number of reads analyzed.

To investigate a possible confounding effect of age, overweight, insulin resistance, diet type, and hypolactasia, diversity analyses were repeated with these variables. Age was found to be positively associated with the abundance of the three significant taxa and positively and weakly with Faith’s phylogenetic diversity, but not the number of observed OTUs or weighted or unweighted UniFrac distance matrices (S2 Fig). The remaining studied parameters did not influence alpha or beta diversity results (S3 and S4 Figs) or relative abundances at any taxonomic level, with one exception. A diet high in carbohydrates was associated with a higher abundance of bacteria from the phylum Cyanobacteria (S2 Fig).

Zonulin, a regulator of tight junction function, was significantly higher in the serum (p = 0.006), but not in the stool (p = 0.063) of PCOS patients (Fig 6). Serum DAO, a marker for intestinal epithelial damage, was significantly higher in PCOS patients (p = 0.044). Serum endotoxin was not different between PCOS patients and controls. LBP, which binds endotoxin, tended to be higher in the serum of PCOS patients (p = 0.053), while the soluble LPS receptor, sCD14, was unchanged. Stool calprotectin, a marker for intestinal inflammation, was unchanged between patients and controls.

We investigated the association of microbial alpha and beta diversity and Tenericutes, ML615J-28, and S24-7 with parameters of gut barrier function and inflammation. Stool zonulin, serum zonulin, and LPS were inversely and moderately associated with indices of alpha diversity (Fig 7A–7C). Serum LPS and stool calprotectin were associated with sample clustering in unweighted and weighted UniFrac plots, respectively (Fig 7D and 7E). Total blood lymphocyte counts were inversely associated with Tenericutes relative abundance (Fig 7F). Serum hsCRP, DAO, LBP, and blood leukocytes were not associated with alpha or beta diversity or the relative abundance of Tenericutes, ML615J-28, or S24-7 (data not shown).

In this pilot study, we provide a first description of the stool microbiome of women with PCOS diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria. We observed a statistically significant 15% reduction in Faith’s phylogenetic diversity and the number of observed OTUs, accompanied by phylogenetic microbiome profile shifts between samples from PCOS patients and controls in unweighted UniFrac analysis. Additionally, PCOS patients had a lower relative abundance of three bacterial taxa, the phylum Tenericutes, the order ML615J-28 (belonging to the phylum Tenericutes), and the family S24-7 (belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes).

Strengths of our study are the thorough metabolic and reproductive characterization of our PCOS patients, including androgen measurements by mass spectrometry, the use of relative abundance filters to reduce OTU inflation due to sequencing errors, and the consideration of possible confounding factors such as age, diet, and adult-type hypolactasia. Weaknesses of the study include the small sample size, which precluded stratification of PCOS patients based on diagnostic criteria or metabolic parameters, the high prevalence of PCOS patients with a mild phenotype, and the assessment of gut barrier function using surrogate parameters rather than an in vivo lactulose-mannitol test. Despite these shortcomings, the study achieved its aim of providing a first descriptive look into the gut microbiome-gut barrier axis in PCOS and a knowledge base for future studies.
