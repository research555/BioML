Iron status influences non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in obesity through the gut microbiome

The gut microbiome and iron status are known to play a role in the pathophysiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although their complex interaction remains unclear.

Here, we applied an integrative systems medicine approach (faecal metagenomics, plasma and urine metabolomics, hepatic transcriptomics) in 2 well-characterised human cohorts of subjects with obesity (discovery n = 49 and validation n = 628) and an independent cohort formed by both individuals with and without obesity (n = 130), combined with in vitro and animal models. Serum ferritin levels, as a markers of liver iron stores, were positively associated with liver fat accumulation in parallel with lower gut microbial gene richness, composition and functionality. Specifically, ferritin had strong negative associations with the Pasteurellaceae, Leuconostocaceae and Micrococcaea families. It also had consistent negative associations with several Veillonella, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species, but positive associations with Bacteroides and Prevotella spp. Notably, the ferritin-associated bacterial families had a strong correlation with iron-related liver genes. In addition, several bacterial functions related to iron metabolism (transport, chelation, heme and siderophore biosynthesis) and NAFLD (fatty acid and glutathione biosynthesis) were also associated with the host serum ferritin levels. This iron-related microbiome signature was linked to a transcriptomic and metabolomic signature associated to the degree of liver fat accumulation through hepatic glucose metabolism. In particular, we found a consistent association among serum ferritin, Pasteurellaceae and Micrococcacea families, bacterial functions involved in histidine transport, the host circulating histidine levels and the liver expression of GYS2 and SEC24B. Serum ferritin was also related to bacterial glycine transporters, the host glycine serum levels and the liver expression of glycine transporters. The transcriptomic findings were replicated in human primary hepatocytes, where iron supplementation also led to triglycerides accumulation and induced the expression of lipid and iron metabolism genes in synergy with palmitic acid. We further explored the direct impact of the microbiome on iron metabolism and liver fact accumulation through transplantation of faecal microbiota into recipient’s mice. In line with the results in humans, transplantation from ‘high ferritin donors’ resulted in alterations in several genes related to iron metabolism and fatty acid accumulation in recipient’s mice.

Altogether, a significant interplay among the gut microbiome, iron status and liver fat accumulation is revealed, with potential significance for target therapies.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent metabolic disease (the worldwide prevalence of NAFLD is 25.2% and increasing [1]) that can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, being a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. NAFLD is complex and multifactorial, with iron interacting with the development of NAFLD [2] through gluconeogenic signals [3]. In the liver, iron induces the synthesis and release of ferritin (an intracellular protein which stores iron), with its serum concentration proportional to body iron stores, and frequently increased in patients with NAFLD [4].

Despite this emerging evidence suggesting a role of both the gut microbiome and iron in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, their complex cross-talk remains unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we applied an integrative systems medicine approach (faecal metagenomics, plasma and urine metabolomics, hepatic transcriptomics) in 3 well-characterised human cohorts, combined with in vitro and animal models, to characterize mechanisms responsible for the interaction between the gut microbiome and iron metabolism in NAFLD.

An overview of the study human cohorts and omics analyses pipeline can be found in Figure S1. Serum ferritin was measured in three cohorts: (a) a discovery cohort of subjects with obesity (n = 49); (b) a validation cohort of subjects with obesity from Italy and Spain (n = 628); and (c) an independent cohort of subjects with and without obesity from Spain (n = 130). Plasma and urine metabolomics were acquired in a subsample of both the discovery and the replication cohorts (plasma (n=48 and n=328) and urine (n=47 and n=322, respectively). The transcriptome was analysed in a subsample of the discovery and replication cohorts (n = 86). Finally, faecal samples from 56 women with obesity from the replication and validation cohort, and 130 subjects with and without obesity from the independent cohort were used to perform shotgun metagenomics sequencing.

In both discovery and replication cohorts, serum ferritin increased with the severity of liver fat accumulation (Fig.
1a, b). No significant associations were found between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and serum ferritin (Fig.
1c, Figure S2a,b) in any of the three cohorts. We also performed shotgun metagenomics, 1H NMR spectroscopy and transcriptomics to characterize the faecal microbiome, the biofluid metabolome and the liver transcriptome. Having processed > 5 Gb of metagenomic sequence data per individual, we derived taxonomy and gene richness as well as mapping and annotation of gene functions on the integrated gene catalog for a subsample (n = 56) of women with obesity from Italy and Spain [5]. Subjects within the highest ferritin quartiles (Q3 and Q4) had decreased gene richness compared with those in the lower ferritin quartile (Q1) (Fig.
1d). Consistently, multivariate penalized regression models adjusted for age, BMI, country and hs-CRP revealed a significant association between serum ferritin and the gut microbiome with significant decreases in families from the Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria phyla, particularly Pasteurellaceae, Leuconostocaceae and Micrococcaceae (Fig.
1e,f). Similar results were obtained from multivariate orthogonal partial least squares (O-PLS) regression and posterior validation by univariate partial Spearman’s correlation (pSC) analyses adjusted by age, BMI, country and hs-CRP (Figure S3a–f). Notably, all identified ferritin-associated bacterial families (with the exception of Leuconostocaceae) had a strong correlation with iron-related genes such as TFRC, HAMP, MitoNEET, IRP1 and ferroportin (SLC40A1), measured by quantitative qRT-PCR (Figure S4). We replicated these findings using DESeq2 analysis in an independent cohort of 130 subjects with and without obesity (Additional file 1: Table S1), in whom the majority of the associations between serum ferritin and bacterial families and genera were confirmed after adjustment for age, BMI, sex and hs-CRP (Fig.
1g, Figure S3g, h, Additional file 2: Table S2). The most consistent results were the negative associations of several Veillonella, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species (from phyla Firmicutes and Actinobacteria) with serum ferritin levels, and positive associations with Bacteroides and Prevotella species (from phylum Bacteroidetes). When we analysed the data according to the obesity status, we found consistent negative associations of serum ferritin with Lactobacillales, Pasteurellaceae, Streptococcaceae and Mycobacteriaceae in both individuals with and without obesity. DESeq2 analysis at the species level also revealed consistent associations with Veillonella sp. AS16, Veillonella sp. 6_1_27, Lactobacillales, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lachnospiraceae bacterium TF01-11, Bacteroides sp. GAC:633, Bacteroides coprophilus, Mediterranea massiliensis, Millionella massiliensis and Prevotella sp. CAG:487 in both subjects with and without obesity. Notably, the microbiome associated with hs-CRP was markedly different to that linked to serum ferritin (Figure S5a,b). In addition to the microbiome composition, their functionality was also evaluated by shotgun sequencing in this cohort. Remarkably, analysis of bacterial metagenomes based on KEGG functional annotation identified several bacterial functions related to iron and amino acids transport, glutathione metabolism, heme and siderophore biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis and DNA replication and repair, associated with serum ferritin concentrations (Fig.
1h, Additional file 3: Table S3). Additional O-PLS regression analyses based on EggNOG functional annotations revealed similar results (Figure S5c, d and Additional file 4: Table S4).

We then explored the associations of serum ferritin with the liver transcriptome in a subsample (n = 86) of the discovery and replication cohorts from Italy and Spain. Out of the 48 mRNAs identified from an O-PLS model (Fig.
2a), transferrin receptor (TFRC, pFDR < 1.0 × 10−10), hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (HAMP, pFDR = 1.95 × 10−5), NCOA4 (pFDR = 0.05) and ferritin heavy chain (FTH1, pFDR = 0.003), all involved in iron status [9], were the mRNAs most associated with serum ferritin after further individual validation by pSC (Fig.
2b). Enrichment analyses highlighted a significant over-representation of pathways associated with iron and glucose metabolism (Fig.
2c). We further investigated the association between the expression of several solute carrier transporters (SLCs) and the serum ferritin concentration (Fig.
2d, e). SLC51A, SLC11A1 and SLC6A9 had the strongest associations with serum ferritin. Afterwards, integrating metagenomic and transcriptomic results, we identified iron-associated transcriptome signatures linked to the microbiome and the degree of liver fat accumulation (Fig.
2f–k, Figure S6). From O2-PLS multivariate integration between ferritin-associated bacterial families and transcripts, hierarchical clustering analysis and univariate pSC, we identified a clear cluster comprising NUDT10, NNMT, MTUS1, SOCS2 and SBNO2, downregulated with increased ferritin levels (Fig.
2h) and correlated to variation in different bacterial families that were themselves linked to serum ferritin (Fig.
2g, k). In a second cluster, the expression of SEC24B, GYS2, SLC51A, TFRC, RPSX5, LOC100130078 and ACSM5 was also mirrored by these families. A third cluster of genes positively associated with ferritin (USP3, SIX1, PDE7A and SNAPC2) also anti-correlated with those bacterial families. Remarkably, the expression of most of these bacterial-associated genes, changed in proportion to both serum ferritin levels and liver fat accumulation (Figure S6).

We then sought to validate the transcriptome findings by studying the effects of iron and palmitic acid (PA), a trigger of hepatic fat accumulation [10], in human primary hepatocytes. We found that iron, PA and PA supplementation in cells pretreated with iron led to triglyceride accumulation in primary human hepatocytes (Figure S7a, b). Notably, iron induced a striking increase in the expression of lipid metabolism genes (FABP4, FABP5, FATP5) and of the fatty acid transporter CD36 in synergy with PA (Figure S7c–f) in parallel to upregulated iron-related genes (FTL and FTH) (Figure S7g, h).

Strikingly, PA supplementation in cells pretreated with iron downregulated the expression of most of the identified genes associated negatively with serum ferritin (GY2, SEC24B, MTUS1, SOCS2, SLC51A) compared to PA or iron alone (Fig.
2l–s) in parallel to fat accumulation, confirming the associations observed in subjects with different degrees of hepatic fat accumulation. The exception was SBNO2, known to be increased in proinflammatory responses. Conversely, genes associated positively with serum ferritin (PDE7A) and also with liver steatosis increased significantly after iron exposure.

We then performed discovery and replication metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for ferritin in serum (Fig.
3a–d) and urine (Fig.
3e–h) using O-PLS multivariate regressions confirmed by pSC. We identified several metabolites, such as ketone bodies and gluconeogenic substrates, in both discovery (n = 48 for plasma; n = 47 for urine) and replication (n = 328 for plasma; n = 322 for urine) cohorts associated to the identified hepatic transcriptome signatures (Fig.
2i, j) linked to the microbiome and severity of NAFLD. Integration of ferritin-associated metabolites and bacterial families by O2-PLS regression (Fig.
3i, j) revealed strong positive associations between histidine, tyrosine, citrulline and glutamine and bacterial families negatively associated with serum ferritin (Fig.
3j–l). These families also had strong negative associations with ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB) and acetoacetate).

To validate the cross-talk between iron status and the microbiome uncovered in humans, we first tested whether the dietary iron content impacts the microbiome in vivo in the mouse (Fig.
4a). Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we showed that variation in dietary iron dramatically reshapes the composition of the gut microbiota (Fig.
4b, c). Then, we characterised the impact of a high-fat diet vs. control diet with different iron contents in mice using metagenomics (Fig.
4d). Bacterial biodiversity and observed species changed dramatically according to fat and iron content of the diet (Fig.
4e–g). While a high-fat diet decreased bacterial biodiversity under a low iron diet, the opposite as found in diets with high iron content. Principal coordinate analyses revealed different microbial community compositions depending on the iron content in each diet (Fig.
4h, i). Interestingly, the differences in the microbial composition between the high-fat and control diets decreased with iron content, becoming non-significant at high iron levels (Figure S8a–d). Several families and genera in the phylum Firmicutes inversely associated with serum ferritin in patients were confirmed to be influenced accordingly by the iron content of the mice diet in O-PLS models (Fig.
4j–m).

After showing that iron availability greatly influences the gut bacterial ecosystem, we evaluated whether the microbiota on its own might affect iron status. We leveraged our previous mouse study showing that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) triggered hepatic fat accumulation [5] to evaluate the relationship between human donor ferritin levels and iron-related genes in recipient mice (Fig.
4n). O-PLS-discriminant analysis revealed that microbiota from the ‘high ferritin donors’ group resulted in alterations in genes related to iron metabolism, with increases in ftl1, fth1 and slc40a1, in parallel to decreased tfrc (Fig.
4o–r), which is in line with the transcriptomic results in humans and the in vitro results from human primary hepatocytes. Also, in agreement with the in vitro results, the microbiota from ‘high ferritin donors’ also increased the expression of fabp4 in recipient’s mice livers, showing the effect ferritin-associated microbiota on liver lipid accumulation.

In the current study, we evaluated the contribution of the gut microbiota in iron status and liver fat accumulation in a discovery and validation cohort of patients with obesity and an additional independent cohort of individuals with and without. We further identified a potential role of the microbiome as a regulator of iron status controlling hepatic fat deposition in animal models. Serum ferritin levels were positively associated with liver fat accumulation in parallel to a decrease in several bacterial families. At the same time, these ferritin-related families were associated with liver genes involved in iron metabolism. The Pasteurellaceae family had the strongest negative association with the serum ferritin levels, which is consistent with their reliance on utilizing iron from host transferrin for growth and survival [11]. Recently, hepatic lipid levels, including bile acids, have been recently negatively correlated with Micrococcaceae in diabetic mice [12], and the Desulfovibrionaceae family has been associated to overfeeding-induced fatty liver [13]. Consistent with our results, increases in the caecal contents of Coprococcus were identified in rats supplemented with iron, which were suggested to mediate oxidative stress and histopathological alterations observed in the liver of these animals [14]. Also in agreement with our results, low serum ferritin concentrations coexisted with decreased abundance of Veillonella species in ulcerative colitis patients receiving FMT from healthy donors [15], while Veillonella genus abundance was dose-dependently enriched after improvement of steatosis in NASH patients [16]. In addition, those with > 70% reduction in liver fat had a trend towards reduction of Methanobrevibacter, which we also found negatively associated with serum ferritin levels. Significant and drastic increases in Bacteroides and Prevotella have been observed in obese and NASH individuals, while a progressive decrease in the abundance of Bifidobacterium was observed from healthy to NASH groups [17]. Finally, lack of iron requirements in lactic acid bacteria is in agreement with the negative associations observed among several Lactobacillus species and the serum ferritin levels.

The current study presents some limitations. A minority of the bacterial population might have a role in NAFLD development but could remain undetected by metagenomics. On the other hand, the FMT experiment has also its limitations because some strictly anaerobic bacterial species might have a role in NAFLD development but are lost during sample collection, storage and manipulation. We showed changes in the expression of iron-related genes, but the impact of these changes on iron levels of mice was not evaluated. Therefore, the causal role of the microbiome as a regulator of iron status needs to be further confirmed with the measurement of circulating iron makers in these mice. Finally, we showed iron supplementation impacts on the microbiome composition and that bacterial biodiversity and observed species changed dramatically according to fat and iron content of the diet (Fig.
4e–g). It needs to be further investigated whether iron supplementation impacts on fat deposition in the liver in mice under different feeding regimes.

In conclusion, combining a comprehensive systems medicine approach with validations in independent cohorts and causality assessment in pre-clinical models, our findings demonstrate a significant cross-talk among gut microbiota, iron status and liver fat accumulation. In particular, we uncover microbiome- and iron-linked metabolomic and transcriptomic signatures involving imbalances in gluconeogenic metabolites, ketone bodies and cellular transport, which altogether modulate liver fat accumulation. This work highlights the crucial importance of the interplay between micronutrients, microbiome and host homeostasis in general [34] and the Microbiome-Iron-Liver fat axis in particular, thereby disclosing potential targets for therapy.

The discovery cohort included n = 49 obese patients aged 24 to 63 years old at the Endocrinology Service of the Hospital Universitari de Girona Dr Josep Trueta (Girona, Spain). The replication cohort comprised n = 628 obese patients aged 20 to 67 years old at the Endocrinology Service of the Hospital Universitari de Girona Dr Josep Trueta (n = 287) and at the Center for Atherosclerosis of Policlinico Tor Vergata University of Rome (Rome, Italy; n = 341). Sample size was not determined by statistical methods and is comparable to other studies in the field [35–37]. All subjects gave written informed consent, validated and approved by the ethical committee of the Hospital Universitari Dr Josep Trueta (Comitè d’Ètica d’Investigació Clínica, approval number 2009 046) and Policlinico Tor Vergata University of Rome (Comitato Etico Indipendente, approval number 28-05-2009). Inclusion criteria included Caucasian origin, stable body weight 3 months before the study, free of any infection 1 month preceding the study and absence of any systemic disease. Exclusion criteria were the following: presence of liver disease (specifically tumoural disease and hepatitis C virus infection) and thyroid dysfunction (based on biochemical work-up), alcohol consumption (> 20 g/day), hepatitis B (anti-HD virus antibodies), drug-induced liver injury (using a drug questionnaire).

Stool, plasma and urine samples from all subjects were obtained during the week before elective gastric bypass surgery, during which the liver biopsy was sampled. All samples were stored at − 80 °C. Liver samples were collected in RNAlater, fragmented and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at − 80 °C.

An ultrasound system with a 3.5 MHz convex transducer (Siemens Acuson S2000, Mochida Siemens Medical System, Tokyo, Japan) was used to scan the liver. Hepatic steatosis was defined as absent (grade 0: < 5% steatosis), mild (grade 1: 5–33% steatosis), moderate (grade 2: > 33–66% steatosis) or severe (grade 3: > 66% steatosis) using the scoring system for NAFLD [38]. Images were independently evaluated by two radiologists blinded to clinical and laboratory data [39].

Liver biopsies were previously obtained for n = 86 patients who underwent bariatric surgery [5]. The investigators were blind to group allocations. Liver biopsies were analysed by a single pathologist expert in hepatic pathology. For each liver sample, haematoxylin and eosin, reticulin and Masson’s trichrome staining were performed. Hepatic steatosis grade was determined according to the scoring system for NAFLD [38].

Serum ferritin in both discovery and replication cohorts was measured by microparticle enzyme immunoassay (AxSYMTM; Abbot Laboratories) with intra- and inter-assay CVs < 6%.

Spectroscopic analysis of urine (n = 47 for discovery cohort, n = 322 for replication cohort) and plasma samples (n = 48 for discovery cohort, n = 328 for replication cohort) was performed on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with either a 5-mm TXI probe operating at 600.13 MHz or a 5-mm BBI probe operating at 600.44 MHz. The 90° pulse length was determined prior to each run and field frequency was locked using D2O as solvent. Detailed procedures are included in supplementary materials.

Transcriptomic analyses from liver biopsies have been previously described [5] and detailed procedures are included in supplementary materials.

Bacterial population in mouse faeces from studies 1 and 3 was determined using next-generation high throughput sequencing of variable regions of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene, whereas a shotgun metagenomic sequencing was employed for mice study 2 and human cohorts. Detailed protocols are included in supplementary materials.

Cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes (HH) were commercially sourced (Innoprot, Bizkaia, Spain) and cultured with hepatocytes medium (Innoprot) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% hepatocytes growth supplement (mixture of growth factors, hormones and proteins necessary for culture of primary hepatocytes) and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin. HH were grown on poly-l-lysine pre-coated cell dishes at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere following manufacturer’s recommendations. Cells were treated with iron for 48 or 72 h alone, or in combination with palmitic acid (PA) for 24 h following the iron 48/72 h treatment. Compounds were prepared as follows: 27.84 mg of PA (Sigma, San Luis, MO) was dissolved in 1 ml sterile water to obtain a 100 mM stock solution. Five percent bovine serum albumin (BSA) was prepared in serum-free DMEM and then mixed with PA stock solution for at least 1 h at 40 °C to obtain a 5 mM solution. Iron was dissolved in water. Iron was used at 50 μM for 48 or 72 h, and PA 200 μM for 24 h. BSA was used in all treatments as the vehicle. All experimental conditions were performed in 4 biological replicates. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and collected with Qiazol for RNA purification or fixed with paraformaldehyde 4% for Oil Red O staining. After fixation, cells were dipped in isopropanol 60% before completely dried and stained with Oil Red O (Sigma, Lyon, France) for 10 min at room temperature. Pictures were taken using an inverted microscope.

Total RNA was extracted and purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Gaithersburg, MD) following manufacturers’ protocol. Gene expression procedures were assessed using LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche Diagnostics SL, Barcelona, Spain), using Sybr-green technology suitable for relative genetic expression quantification. Peptidylprolyl isomerase A was used as housekeeping.

Detailed procedure for the animal studies is included in supplementary materials. To assess the effects of dietary iron on the gut microbiome (mice study 1), 12-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed with low- (LI: 4 mg/kg), low-normal- (LNI: 35 mg/kg), high-normal- (HNI: 500 mg/kg), moderately high- (MHI: 2000 mg/kg) or high- (HI: 20,000 mg/kg) carbonyl iron diets for 9 weeks before sacrifice. The impact of different diets on the effects of dietary iron on the gut microbiome (mice study 2) was assessed by feeding mice with either a ‘no-High Fat Diet’ (No-HFD) or a ‘High Fat diet’ (HFD) with different concentrations of iron representing the LI, LNI, HNI and MHI diets. Finally, the causal role of the microbiome on iron status was evaluated by faecal microbiota transplantation from low- (n = 3) and high- (n = 3) ferritin donors matched for age and BMI to recipient mice (mice study 3).

Ferritin distribution and normality was checked visually and using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests and was found to be not normally distributed. Metagenomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic data were also not normally distributed. Therefore, all univariate correlations analyses were based on partial Spearman’s correlation (pSC) adjusting for age, BMI, sex and country. Multivariate analyses were performed on the log10 transformed data. Associations between serum ferritin and steatosis grade in the discovery and replication cohorts were assessed by non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test and steatosis grade 0 (absence) was compared to grades 1–3 using the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Associations between microbiome, transcriptomic or metabolomic data with serum ferritin quartiles were assessed by non-parametric Mann-Kendall test to detect monotonic trends. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to individually compare the lowest ferritin quartile (Q1 used as reference) with the higher quartiles.

Taxa were filtered so that only those having a relative abundance > 20% in at least 20% of the samples were considered for further analyses. To identify families and genera associated with serum ferritin, we applied both multivariate Mnet regularization regression [40] models and DESeq2 [41] analyses including age, BMI, country and hs-CRP as covariates using the R package ncvreg, phyloseq and DESeq2. The Mnet uses a combination of ridge (l2) and minimax concave penalties (MCP) to deal efficiently with predictors ≥ n problems with highly correlated predictors, which is typical of omics data. Combining both penalties, the Mnet performs variable selection by forcing the regression coefficients of variables not actually associated with the response to 0 and at the same time handles multicollinearity within the data. In the Mnet, there are three parameters that need to be tuned: the regularization parameter (λ ≥ 0) controlling the shrinkage of the variables, the elastic net mixing parameter (0 < α < 1) controlling the contribution of ridge (α = 0) and LASSO (α = 1) penalty to the model, and the MCP penalty (γ). These were optimized by 10-fold cross-validation. The relationship between serum ferritin quartiles and MGR was assessed using a generalized linear model (GLM) with a multinomial probability distribution and a cumulative logit as a link function to account for non-normality adjusting for age and BMI using SPSS.

Alpha and beta diversity indices were obtained using the R package vegan. Trends between alpha diversity measures and iron doses for each diet were assessed by non-parametric Mann-Kendall test, whereas differences between HFD and no-HFD for each iron dose were assessed by non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. To estimate the relatedness of microbial communities among groups, beta diversity distances between samples were examined using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Differences in microbial composition were assessed by PERMANOVA analyses using the Adonis function in vegan R package with 999 permutations. Families and genera responsible for differences in the microbial compositions among iron doses for each diet were identified through multivariate O-PLS modelling, whereby the microbiome composition was used as the descriptor matrix (X) to predict the iron dose (Y). The predictive performance of the model (Q2Y) was calculated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach and model validity was established by permutation testing (1000 permutations). Variable selection was based on O-PLS regression loadings adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (pFDR). A pFDR < 0.05 was used as the reference feature selection criterium.

For transcriptomic and metabolomic data, we used a combination of multivariate O-PLS modelling and partial Spearman’s correlation (pSC) using in-house MATLAB scripts. First, an O-PLS model was built. Here, the omics profiles were used as the descriptor matrix (X) to predict serum ferritin as the response variable (Y). Then, variable selection was achieved combining the variable importance for projection (O-PLS-VIP) [42] and the O-PLS regression loadings adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (pFDR). A pFDR < 0.05 was used as the reference feature selection criterium. However, a less restrictive threshold (pFDR < 0.1 unless otherwise indicated) was used to include variables with high VIP (> 1). Finally, each individual variable identified form multivariate models was further validated by pSC adjusting for age, BMI, sex and country.

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) was performed to identify general patterns of transcriptomic variation among serum ferritin quartiles. Significant transcripts associated with serum ferritin were used for sample clustering. Before clustering, data were standardized as z scores across samples for each transcript. This standardized matrix was then used in unsupervised HCA using Euclidean distances and Ward linkage. Heatmaps and dendrograms following HCA were generated using the heatmap.2 function from the gplots R package. In the heatmaps, a red-blue colour scale was used whereby shades of red and blue represent higher and lower values, respectively, compared with the mean.

To explore the functional associations among the microbiome changes and metabolic and transcriptomic perturbations associated with serum ferritin, were used two approaches. First, datasets were integrated using an O2-PLS approach. It is a bidirectional multivariate regression method that allows separate joint covariance between two blocks from systemic variation specific (orthogonal) to each block (X and Y) [43]. The number of components for the predictive and orthogonal blocks was selected based on a 7-fold cross-validation using the R package OmicsPLS [44]. Variable loadings for each block were scaled as correlation coefficient (pcorr and qcorr for X and Y, respectively) and represented in a correlation circle plot. Scaling was performed by calculating the correlation between each variable and its associated component. The longer the distance to the origin, the stronger the relationship between variables. Strongly positively associated variables or groups of variables are projected closely to each other on the correlation circle (~ 0° angle). The variables or groups of variables strongly negatively associated are projected diametrically opposite (~ 180° angle) on the correlation circle. Variables not correlated are situated ~ 90° one from the other. Additionally, univariate partial Spearman’s correlations adjusted for age, BMI, sex and country were calculated and represented as correlation heatmaps. Only significant correlations (p < 0.05) are displayed. A pFDR correction was used to adjust P values for multiple testing. Significant associations after a pFDR correction (< 0.05) are highlighted with a black box.

Differentially expressed genes associated with serum ferritin were annotated via over-representation analysis using the Consensus Pathway database (CPDB) [45]. Pathway significance was assessed using a hypergeometric test and a Bonferroni procedure was applied for multiple testing correction.
