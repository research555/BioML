Intestinal Microbiota: A Novel Target to Improve Anti-Tumor Treatment?

Recently, preclinical and clinical studies targeting several types of cancer strongly supported the key role of the gut microbiota in the modulation of host response to anti-tumoral therapies such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy and even surgery. Intestinal microbiome has been shown to participate in the resistance to a wide range of anticancer treatments by direct interaction with the treatment or by indirectly stimulating host response through immunomodulation. Interestingly, these effects were described on colorectal cancer but also in other types of malignancies. In addition to their role in therapy efficacy, gut microbiota could also impact side effects induced by anticancer treatments. In the first part of this review, we summarized the role of the gut microbiome on the efficacy and side effects of various anticancer treatments and underlying mechanisms. In the second part, we described the new microbiota-targeting strategies, such as probiotics and prebiotics, antibiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation and physical activity, which could be effective adjuvant therapies developed in order to improve anticancer therapeutic efficiency.

Cancer is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Although the death rate from cancer in the United-States has declined steadily over the past 25 years, the American Cancer Society has estimated a total of 1,762,450 new cancer cases and 606,880 deaths from cancer to occur in the country in 2019. It is estimated that microorganisms could be associated with 15% to 20% of cancers [1]. In the recent years, evidence from numerous studies has pointed to the role of commensal microbes as key determinants of health or pathologic conditions, including cancer [2]. The human microbiota is made up of trillions of cells, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. As the largest population of microbes resides in the gut, intestinal microbiota has been widely studied.

In the first part of this review, we summarized the impact of the gut microbiome on the efficacy of various anticancer therapies including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. In the second part, we described the microbiota-targeting strategies developed in order to improve anticancer-therapeutics efficiency.

Recent preclinical and few clinical studies focusing on several types of cancer strongly support the key role of the gut bacteria in the modulation of host response to anti-tumor drugs, especially chemotherapy and immunotherapy [12]. Studies have suggested that gut microbes play a significant role in anticancer therapy response by modulating drug efficacy, abolishing the anticancer effect, and mediating toxicity. Although the mechanisms are not well understood, some of them have been described as the “TIMER” framework mechanism for Translocation, Immunomodulation, Metabolism, Enzymatic degradation and Reduced diversity [12,13]. In this section, we summarized the role of commensal microbes in modulating cancer therapies efficacy, resistance and toxicity.

Gut microbiota seem to be implicated on chemotherapy efficacy through numerous mechanisms, including xenometabolism, immune interactions, and altered community structure [13].

All these data suggest that the gut microbiota appears to be an essential biomarker to consider for improving chemotherapy regimens. Further clinical studies will be performed to evaluate these innovative markers.

The important role of gut microbiota on immunotherapy efficacy was first shown in two studies which highlighted the involvement of the complex crosstalk between bacteria and immune host response in anti-tumor activity [10,44]. The first study by Paulos et al. [44] showed that the efficacy of anti-tumor CD8+ T cells adoptive transfer in a melanoma murine model was strongly increased after the total body irradiation of mice through the translocation of gut bacteria into mesenteric lymph nodes. The microbial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) release induced by irradiation activated innate immune response by TLR4 pathway stimulation and then boosted anti-tumor CD8+ T cells, while antibiotic treatment or LPS neutralization (with polymyxin B) were associated with a decrease of anti-tumor response [44]. This effect of gut microbial composition on anti-tumor T cells adoptive transfer has been recently confirmed in B-cell lymphoma, and in cervix and lung tumor mice models [33,45]. The second study, led by Iida et al. [10], described, in MC38 colon carcinoma and B16 melanoma subcutaneous cancer murine models, that antibiotic treatment impaired the efficacy of the anti-IL-10/CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) immunotherapy. This antibiotic-induced failure of immunotherapy response was due to a decrease of the gut microbiota load, leading to the decline of pro-inflammatory cytokines-producing monocytes in tumor (Figure 2) [10].

These promising results strongly support the inclusion of microbial targeting in anti-tumor immunotherapy strategies to enhance their efficacy, as reported in clinical trials. However, the clinical translation of microbiome effects on immunotherapy is limited by the fact that most preclinical studies have been conducted in mice carrying ectopic syngenic tumor that have already undergone a process of immune editing before transfer into their new host. These models cannot account for the constantly changing interactions between the immune system and tumors during the cancer elimination, equilibrium and escape stages. For a deeper comprehension of the underlying molecular mechanisms, humanized animal models or models of spontaneous tumorigenesis will probably be needed.

Radiotherapy is one of common treatments for patients with solid cancers. Ionizing radiation directly induces DNA damage by an energy transfer indirectly through the production of ROS or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [59,60]. Moreover, radiotherapy can induce local immunogenic effects, such as immunogenic tumor cell death, activating local and systemic inflammation and modulating immunity [61]. Radiotherapy is also responsible of stimulation of the innate immune system. Barker et al. [62] underlined the triggering of a releasing of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α and immune cell recruitment after treatment. However, tumor response after radiotherapy remains very heterogeneous, with significant differences from one patient to another and very variable oncologic outcomes. The cause of this heterogeneity remains unclear but recent data have suggested that tumor response could be affected by gut microbiota. The role of intestinal microbiota in radiosensitivity is a new concept generating a lot of interest but with still few original studies leading to convincing results [59]. Emerging preclinical studies performed on mouse models have tried to understand the link between gut microbiota and radioresistance. Cui et al. [63] investigated the effect of circadian rhythm on radiotherapy (with total body exposure) and compared it with the composition of the microbiota. They found that mice with normal 12-h dark/12-h light cycles had a significantly better survival than those with different cycles (8-h dark/16-h light or 16-h light/8-h dark). This was correlated to alterations in gut bacterial communities which could be part of the radioresistance mechanisms. The same team described a correlation between intestinal bacterial communities and radiosensitivity with an antibiotic-treated mouse model. The enteric bacterial composition of treated mice was significantly different from that of control group and the survival rate of antibiotic-treated mice was significantly higher after irradiation [64]. Another hypothesis concerns the link between radioresistance and autophagy regulation, which has already been suggested for nearly 20 years [65]. Digomann et al. [66] found that the expression level of some proteins involved in autophagy was correlated with the clinical prognosis of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with radiochemotherapy [67]. Gut microbiota is also involved in autophagy regulation. Indeed, as described above, the role of Fusobacterium nucleatum in chemoresistance through autophagy activation has been shown [41] (Figure 1). To date, no studies on the potential effect of gut microbiota composition on radiosensitivity through autophagy modulation have been published.

In conclusion, it is admitted that the intestinal microbiota could be a key player for the modulation of systemic immune response with radiosensitivity and radio-induced toxicity modulation [76]. However, the direct impact of gut microbiota on the efficacy of radiotherapy has not really been demonstrated yet [74]. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to identify the microbial populations involved in radioresistance and to make mechanistic assumptions.

To our knowledge, the potential impact of gut microbiota on surgery outcomes has only been demonstrated in CRC, probably given the direct interaction between gut microbes and the resection site. The development of preventive strategies to decrease postoperative complications after colorectal surgery remains challenging for physicians treating patients with CRC [77,78,79,80,81]. In particular, anastomotic leaks (AL) are the most common life-threatening postoperative complication. Despite improvements in perioperative medical cares and many studies having been devoted to the technique or the anastomotic configuration, rates of AL have remained largely unchanged over the past decades, reported in 1% to 19% of patients [82,83,84,85]. A potential role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of AL following colorectal surgery is now increasingly obvious [86,87,88,89,90,91]. Blain et al. reported that a parenteral administration of penicillin protected the ischemic bowel from necrosis, a broad spectrum antibiotic being even more protective [92]. The implication of the microbiome in AL was first suggested in the 1950s by Cohn et al., who reported a decrease in AL rates with the intraluminal administration of antibiotics in a dog model of devascularized colonic anastomosis, specifically at the anastomosis site [93]. Since, many studies have investigated the role of an oral antibiotic preparation in elective colorectal surgery and concluded that a potentially significant protective effect of postoperative complications existed, including AL [94]. However, microbial signatures associated with AL and involved mechanisms have been poorly studied. Recently, using 16S MiSeq sequencing on colorectal anastomosis tissue samples, van Praagh et al. reported that AL development was associated with low microbial diversity and correspondingly with a high abundance of the dominant Bacteroidaceae and Lachnospiraceae families and a low abundance of Prevotella oralis [95].

These findings definitely support the need for further clinical investigations on the host-microbiota interactions following colorectal surgery, and especially during the anastomotic healing process, to identify microbial signatures at risk for postoperative complications and to develop effective gut microbiota-targeted preventive strategies.

As described above, intestinal microbiota can provide novel way to enhance the efficacy and to reduce the side effects of current anti-tumoral therapeutic approaches. Several strategies can be considered in order to improve the efficacy of cancer treatment through gut microbiota modulation [9,103,104]. While targeting the gut microbiome has shown some interesting results in the treatment of cancers, the studies demonstrated that improved effects of cancer therapies following microbiota modulation are much more limited [105]. In this second part of the review, we focused on the potential strategies to optimize the microbiota composition in order improve therapy efficiency.

Antibiotics are effective for treating various infections. Depending on their antimicrobial spectrum and pharmacokinetics, they can also change the composition of the gut microbiota. Antibiotics could be used to eliminate the bacteria that exert a negative effect on cancer therapy efficacy. However, the main issue with antibiotics is the lack of specificity, which in turn, can lead to a dysbiotic microbiota and induce detrimental health effects.

Due to a lack of specificity and the induction of a dysbiosis, more investigations are required to reduce the impact of antibiotic use during cancer treatment. Promising perspectives for probiotic co-administration during antibiotic therapy need to be addressed (see below). As an alternative, highly specific strategies such as phagotherapy could be considered to target some gut bacteria. In addition regarding CRC, a preclinical study has demonstrated the efficacy of pro-carcinogenic bacterial-toxin-targeting using small molecules, suggesting the interest of this innovative concept [111].

Fecal transplants come with a lot of unknowns, and given the uncertainties, some scientists argue that testing these approaches in humans is risky. FMT has been widely used in the treatment of resistant Clostridium difficile infection with high response rates [112], giving promising perspectives for other pathologies. However, FMT data in the context of cancer therapy are much more limited and data have been mainly obtained on animal models.

Several clinical trials incorporating FMT in order to improve cancer therapy are still ongoing [103]. A clinical trial led by Dr. Davar (NCT03341143) is currently assessing the effect of FMT in 20 patients with advanced metastatic melanoma who have undergone treatment with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) and have failed or become nonresponsive to the therapy during their treatment. They received a fecal microbiota transplant from patients who had proven to be long-term responders to pembrolizumab, in combination with pembrolizumab treatment. Another clinical trial on 40 melanoma patients who failed immunotherapy by PD-1 blockade started in 2017, led by Dr. Markel (NCT03353402). This study aims to change the gut microbiota of patients with fecal transplants from donors who responded to immunotherapy. However, this trial does not combine FMT with the immunotherapy treatment for which patients were nonresponsive. Other trials using FMT are currently in progress to reduce the adverse effects of anticancer treatments (NCT02928523. Although the clinical relevance of FMT seems promising, leaders in the field are still cautious regarding these trials and are looking for standardized approaches.

The concept of probiotic proposed by Metchnikoff and defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) as “live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host” [113,114], has become an important research field [115]. A recent meta-analysis assessing the efficacy and safety of probiotics in adult and pediatric patients diagnosed with cancer suggests that probiotics may be beneficial, even if the mechanisms underlying antitumor properties remain unclear and further studies are still required [116]. However, although most studies have focused on the effect of probiotics on tumorigenesis inhibition or on cancer therapy-related toxicity [117], only a few studies have assessed the potential of probiotics to enhance the efficiency of cancer treatments [118].

Taken together, all these data give crucial information regarding the potential strains to use in order to improve anticancer-therapy efficacy. However, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying single commensal/probiotic strains effects seems to be the next step to optimize probiotic use in association with cancer treatment.

Many food components act as the actual food for gut bacteria which can metabolize those into tumor suppressive metabolites [124]. The use of prebiotics, known as dietary fibers non-digestible or absorbable by the host and specifically used by gut microbes [125], should increase the colonization and relative expansion of particular bacteria and their specific metabolites, which may have a beneficial effect on anti-tumor treatment. However, the potential effect of prebiotics depends on the presence of beneficial bacteria already in the host gut. Thus, the combination of probiotics and prebiotics, known as synbiotic, seems promising.

As described above, a low diversity of the gut microbiome has been independently associated with poor response to immunotherapy in advanced melanoma patients [49], but also with poor outcomes in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant [126]. In this context, pre- and synbiotic therapy could be considered prior to and along-side therapy to maintain diversity and improve efficacy [8]. To our knowledge, there is only one published study addressing the question of prebiotic or synbiotic in the improvement of cancer treatment efficacy. Indeed, a Brazilian group evaluated the effect of synbiotics in patients with periampullary cancers undergoing curative or palliative treatment by assessing mortality and postoperative infections (NCT0146877). The data published showed a reduced postoperative mortality and complication rates in patients treated pre- and post-surgery with a mixture including Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium bifidum combined with fructooligosaccharides [127]. Moreover, a phase II randomized study started in 2019 aims to investigate the effect of probiotics and prebiotics during the definitive treatment of chemotherapy-radiotherapy for patients with localized anal canal squamous cell cancer to improve treatment effectiveness and clinical outcomes (NCT03870607). Prebiotics or synbiotics might improve oncological outcomes in patients, thus allowing the development of new approaches to increase anticancer therapy efficiency.

Increasing data also suggest the key role of lifestyle on cancer prognosis, more specifically in CRC patients [128]. Dysbiosis could affect the integrity of skeletal muscle, leading to muscle atrophy [129,130,131,132]. The latter is a key player of morbidity and mortality in various cancer entities [133,134,135,136,137] and an important predictor of overall survival in patients, including CRC [138]. The assumption of a new inter-organ cross-talk, ‘gut microbiota-skeletal muscle’ axis, has recently emerged [129]. Indeed, the restoration of commensal E. coli levels in a murine model of intestinal chronic inflammation could prevent muscle atrophy [139]. Moreover, the use of a synbiotic treatment in order to restore a “healthy” microbiota has reduced the proliferation of cancer and muscle cachexia and prolonged the survival of mice [7]. For example, restoration of lactobacilli levels counteracted muscle atrophy and decreased systemic inflammation in preclinical models of cancer cachexia [140,141]. These models are characterized by a common microbial signature resulting mainly in an increase in Enterobacteriaceae species [142,143], specifically Klebsiella oxytoca and in a reduction in three butyrate-producing microbial families (Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Porphyromonadaceae) [144]. Taken together, these preclinical data support that the gut microbiota could be the key player in the intestine-skeletal muscle interconnection and thereby contribute to muscle atrophy in cancer. However, gut microbiota in cancer patients with and without cachexia remains to be explore to reinforce the potential interest of ‘gut microbiota-skeletal muscle’ axis in the care of cancer patients.

Considering the potential importance of ‘gut microbiota-skeletal muscle’ axis, the modulation of microbiota by PA could be an innovative idea with significant scientific and socioeconomic impacts. These interactions remain to be explored in the cancer context to reinforce the potential interest of PA in the care of cancer patients.

An increased number of studies have recently highlighted the key role of the gut microbiome to fight cancers by modulating the efficacy of cancer therapies and their side effects. A deep understanding of the complex interactions between host response and the microbiota appears certainly essential, but also provide promising tools to optimize the use of anticancer drugs through the modulation of the microbiome. Although all underlying mechanisms have not been well identified, promising tools will be developed to optimize therapeutic decisions by using intestinal microbiota composition as a prognostic factor in cancers [49,170,171,172,173]. These approaches will, of course, require fast, robust and inexpensive screening methods to assess microbiome composition of patients. Eventually, interventional strategies could be set up to ensure that patients have a favorable gut microbiota and a competent immune system at the onset of and all along, a personalized cancer therapy. In conclusion, intestinal microbiota undoubtedly constitutes a new promising lever for the scientific and clinical communities to improve the efficacy of anticancer therapies not only in digestive tract neoplasia but also in all the other tissues.
