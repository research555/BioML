The gut microbiome in pancreatogenic diabetes differs from that of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes

We hypothesized that the gut microbiome in patients with diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis (Type 3c) is different from those with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. This was a cross-sectional preliminary study that included 8 patients with Type 1, 10 with Type 2, 17 with Type 3c diabetes and 9 healthy controls. Demographic, clinical, biochemical, imaging and treatment data were recorded and sequencing of the V3–V4 region of the bacterial 16SrRNA was done on fecal samples. Bioinformatics and statistical analyses was performed to evaluate the differences in the diversity indices, distance matrices, relative abundances and uniqueness of organisms between the types of diabetes. There was significant difference in the species richness. Beta diversity was significantly different between patients with Type 3c diabetes and the other groups. 31 genera were common to all the three types of diabetes. There was significant differences in the species level taxa between Type 3c diabetes and the other groups. The unique bacterial species signature in Type 3c diabetes compared to Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes included Nesterenkonia sp. AN1, Clostridium magnum, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Clostridium septicum, Porphyromonas somerae, Terrabacter tumescens, and Synechococus sp.

India harbours 77 million diabetics, which amounts to a national prevalence of 8.9%1. While Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, the prevalence of Type 1 DM is also on the rise in India at a rate of 3–5% every year2. Likewise, there is also a substantially high frequency (~ 38%) of Type 3c diabetes in India3. Type 3c diabetes is defined as diabetes secondary to disease of the exocrine pancreas4. The frequency of Type 3c diabetes among patients with CP in India ranges from around 17% in early onset CP to over 60% in late onset CP5–8. Moreover, the age of onset of this condition is generally lower in India compared to that in the west6,7.

On the premise that the pathophysiology of Type 3c diabetes differ from that of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, we hypothesized that the gut microbiome in Type 3c diabetes will also differ from Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Even though gut microbial dysbiosis has been reported in all these three types of diabetes separately, no head to head comparison have yet been evaluated. We therefore embarked on the current study wherein the objective was to evaluate any difference in the gut microbiome between the three types of diabetes.

A total of 81 individuals were screened out of which 9 healthy volunteers, 8 patients with Type 1, 10 with Type 2 and 17 with Type 3c diabetes were finally included for analyses. The patient flow and clinical characteristics have been depicted in Fig.
1 and Supplementary Table 1 respectively. Supplementary Table 2 represents the metagenomic quality, number of sequences and singletons, and Good’s coverage of the fecal metagenome of individual control and patients.

The microbial alpha diversity indices and beta diversity are depicted in Fig.
2a–f and Supplementary Fig. 1. There were significant difference in the species richness (Chao 1) (p < 0.0001) as shown by a reduction among patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes compared to healthy controls and those with Type 3c diabetes (adjusted p values for HC vs. T1DM = 0.03, HC vs. T2DM = 0.003, T1DM vs. T3cDM = 0.004 and T2DM vs. T3cDM < 0.0001, based on Tukey’s post hoc test) (Supplementary Table 3). Shannon index was found to be lowest in the patients with Type 2 diabetes compared to that of healthy controls and Type 3c diabetes (adjusted p values for HC vs. T2DM = 0.01, T2DM vs. T3cDM = 0.002, based on Tukey’s post hoc test) (Supplementary Table 3).

Figure
2e,f shows the beta diversity between the groups. The beta diversity was similar between the patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, while it was significantly different between patients with Type 3c diabetes and the other groups including healthy controls (Bonferroni corrected p values for HC vs. T1D = 0.001; HC vs. T2D = 0.001; HC vs. T3cD = 0.002; T1D vs. T3cD = 0.001, T2D vs. T3cD = 0.001).

As shown in the PCA plot in Fig.
3a, there was significant differences in the species level taxa between Type 3c diabetes, healthy controls and, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes combined (Bonferroni corrected p values for HC vs. T1D = 0.01; HC vs. T2D = 0.004; HC vs. T3cD = 0.002; T1D vs. T3cD = 0.009, T2D vs. T3cD = 0.002). This was confirmed in a hierarchical dendrogram (Fig.
3b). The scree plot for the PCA analyses have been depicted in Supplementary Fig. 2. The clustering of the different species between healthy controls and all diabetic patients, and between the three diabetic groups are shown in Supplementary Fig. 3.

Supplementary Fig. 7 shows the top 25 species in the study groups while Fig.
6 and Supplementary Table 6 shows the abundances of the species with most significant difference. There was significant reduction of Prevotella copri, Faecalibacterium praustnitzii, Collinsella aerofaciens and Lactobacillus ruminis while significant increase uniquely in Nesterenkonia sp. AN1, Clostridium magnum, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Clostridium septicum, Porphyromonas somerae, Terrabacter tumescens, and Synechococus sp. in Type 3c diabetes compared to Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was significantly low in abundance in Types 1 and 2 diabetes compared to healthy controls.

As shown in Fig.
7, while there was a strong negative correlation between Prevotella and Bacteroides within the healthy control (r = − 0.90; p = 0.001) and Type 1 diabetes (r = − 0.88; p = 0.004) groups, the correlation was lost among patients with Types 2 and 3c diabetes. Furthermore, there was a strong negative correlation between Bifidobacterium and Clostridium among healthy controls (r = − 0.87; p = 002), which was not observed in the diabetes groups. In addition, among patients with Type 2 diabetes, there was a strong negative correlation of Enterococcus with Lactobacillus (r = − 0.77; p = 0.009) and Roseburia (r = − 0.86; p = 0.001). Furthermore, among patients with Type 3c diabetes, there were strong negative correlations of Clostridium with Fecalibacterium (r = − 0.80; p < 0.0001), Ruminococcus (r = − 0.74, p = 0.001), Eubacterium (r = − 0.73, p = 0.001), Roseburia (r = − 0.74; p = 0.001) and Collinsella (r = − 0.72; p = 0.001). There were also strong negative correlations of Enterococcus with Eubacterium (r = − 0.73, p = 0.001), Roseburia (r = − 0.73, p = 0.001) and Collinsella (r = − 0.73, p = 0.001) among the patients with Type 3c diabetes.

We conducted preliminary evaluation for plasma metabolites and pathway enrichment analyses (Fig.
8a–d; Supplementary Fig. 8) in 5 healthy controls and 4 patients with Type 3c diabetes. Although we did not find any significant unique metabolite signature based on the type of diabetes, we did observe a trend towards reduction of l-threonine, l-cystine, l-phenylalanine in Type 3c diabetes compared to healthy controls. Moreover, patients with Type 3c diabetes showed an increasing trend for fatty acids and sphingolipids (eg. myoinositol) compared to the healthy controls. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 9, we could not demonstrate statistically significant differences in the interactions between the microbiome and the metabolome.

In this preliminary cross-sectional study, we have shown that patients with Type 3c diabetes has a unique gut bacterial signature that differs from Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Since the gut microbiota is shaped by a variety of physiological and pathological factors, and the pathophysiology of the three types of diabetes are different, we hypothesized that gut microbial dysbiosis in these patients could also be variable. This speculation was triggered by the results from our earlier studies on CP which suggested that Type 3c diabetes was associated with islet inflammation and infiltration with Th17 cells26–28. It was also suggested that islet inflammation could be contributed by endotoxemia that resulted from gut microbial dysbiosis and altered gut mucosal permeability in these patients20. Even though there are earlier studies that had evaluated the gut microbiome in diabetes, to the best of our knowledge this the first study to have compared the gut microbiome head to head in the three types of diabetes. The other factor that makes the current study relevant is the recent evidence that confirms the Indian gut microbiota to be unique from that seen in the west29. Dubey et al. reported 993 unique organisms in a pan Indian study of which 390 were common to all geographic locations and the most abundant species were Prevotella copri and Faecalibacterium praustnitzii30.

In conclusion, in this preliminary cross-sectional study, we report significant differences in gut microbiome in patients with Type 3c or pancreatogenic diabetes compared to patients with Type 1 and 2 diabetes. Our data needs to be validated in larger multicentre cohorts of patients and the cause-effect relationship needs to be evaluated in experimental studies in order to make the results generalizable.

This preliminary cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care academic centre in accordance with principles of the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2008. Ethical approval was obtained from the AIG Institutional Review Board prior to initiation of the study, and written informed consent was taken from all the participants prior to recruitment. All experimental procedures were performed according to standard guidelines and procedures that were approved by the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology Institutional Review Board. Patients with CP of at least 3 yrs duration and having poorly controlled Type 3c diabetes were screened for enrolment criteria in the Pancreas Clinic over a 9-month period. Patients with poorly controlled Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes were recruited from the Endocrinology outpatient clinic over a 3-month period. Individuals with history of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic liver disease, recent critical illness, ongoing pregnancy, constipation and diarrhoea in the past 3 months, and antibiotics and probiotics intake in the past 3 months were excluded. We recruited healthy family members between 18 and 60yrs age who lived with the patients for at least 10 years as controls. Patients and healthy controls who were obese, smoked cigarettes, consumed alcohol and had poor quantity/quality metagenomic DNA were also excluded.

Data pertaining to demographic characteristics of patients and controls, diabetic status, clinical and imaging parameters of the patients with CP, details of treatment of diabetes and CP were captured in a structured proforma.

CP was defined as per the MANNHEIM classification and confirmed with contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan42. Severity of CP was defined using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) using the Cambridge criteria for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) using the Rosemont criteria43. The different types of diabetes were defined according to the ADA 2014 criteria44. We adopted the term Type 3c diabetes for diabetes secondary to exocrine pancreas as per recent literature. We considered the diagnosis of Type 3c diabetes in the patients with CP if it was diagnosed after a consistent lag period following the onset of CP and had a low to low-normal plasma C-peptide levels. Poorly controlled diabetes was defined as HbA1c of 7% and/or preprandial capillary plasma glucose between 80 and 130 mg/dL and/or peak postprandial capillary plasma glucose of 180 mg/dL.

After recording clinical data, fecal samples were collected in a sterile fecal container, containing 3 ml RNA Later (Qiagen, Germany cat.no/ID: 76,106). Blood samples were collected after 8 h of fasting and 2 h post meal in K3-EDTA tubes for estimation of blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and C-peptide. Blood samples were also collected for evaluation of plasma metabolites in a proportion of patients and healthy controls. Both fecal and plasma samples were stored at − 80 °C immediately after collection until further analysis.

Patients with CP were treated with antioxidant cocktails, pancreatic enzyme supplementation and analgesics on demand. Patients who had recurrent intractable pain that did not respond to medical therapy were treated with endoscopic treatment. Patient with Type 1 diabetes were treated with insulin, while patients with Type 2 and Type 3c diabetes were initiated on oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs). If glycemic control was suboptimal with OHAs, then insulin treatment was initiated.

The metagenomic DNA isolation was performed (200 mg stool/sample) using Qiagen mini stool DNA isolation kit (Germany, Cat. No 81504) as per the manufacturer’s instruction. DNA quantity and quality were assessed using the Nano drop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, IL, USA) based on A260/A280 absorbance and agarose gel electrophoresis (1% wt vol−1 agarose in Tris acetate EDTA). Reagents from the same lot was used for all pre-sequencing sample processing.

NGS of the V3–V4 region of 16SrDNA in the fecal metagenome was conducted on the Illumina MiSeq platform at Xcelris Genomics (Ahmedabad, India) with 2*250 (i.e. paired end) chemistry. The paired end sequence data were assembled into contigs following V3–V4 region amplification using the universal primers (V3-F: 5′ CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG3′ and V4-R: 5′GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC3′). The subsequent steps such as ligation with the adaptors, library preparation, barcode additions were processed as described previously20. The R1 and R2 reads from each sample were stitched or assembled and then proceeded for quality check i.e. phred (Q20) quality score, and sequences with less than Q20 were removed. Chimeric sequences, mismatched sequences, barcodes and the sequences with length less than 100 bp were also removed from the final sequences, following which the rest of the reads were uploaded to the MG-RAST server45. The metadata and raw sequences have also been submitted to the NCBI SRA portal with BioProject accession PRJNA723868 (SRR1430686-SRR1430729). Taxonomic assignment was performed with 95% similarity cut off with the RDP (Ribosomal Database Project) database in the MG-RAST server. We used positive and negative controls in the sequence runs to evaluate for batch effect and inadvertent contamination respectively.

Plasma was separated within 30 min of blood withdrawal from the study participants. Plasma metabolite profiles were screened using the Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS). Briefly, 300 µl of plasma samples were extracted in n-methanol (1:1, vv−1) followed by 15 h incubation on a shaker incubator at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. A 200 µl extract was preserved for drying in a desiccator for 24 h. Derivatization was performed using 50 µl of Pyridine (20 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, (CAS nos. 110-86-1) followed by incubation at 30 °C for 90 min and 30 µl N-trimethylsilyl-N-methyl trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA, Sigma-Aldrich, CAS no. 24589-78-4) followed by re-incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. We did not use any internal standard since the study was focused on untargeted metabolite profiling of the samples.

1 µl of the derivatized samples were prepared for GCMS analysis under the Splitless injection condition as per the program described earlier. We used a triple quadrupole Shimadzu GC 2010 Plus-TP-8030 system (equipped with EB5MS column), and helium was used as the carrier gas. The peak area for each metabolite which was based on the m/z ratio and peak intensity was considered for further analysis. Background peaks and column bleed peaks consisting of silanes and siloxanes were not considered. The peak area of a single compound showing multiple derivatized forms were pooled for the downstream analysis. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library was used to identify the peaks. Further functional analysis of the metabolite was carried out using the human metabolite database (HMDB) (http://www.hmdb.ca)46 and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database (KEGG, http://www.genome.jp/kegg/)47.

Since there are no prior parallel comparison of the gut microbiota between the three types of diabetes, we decided to undertake the current comparison as a preliminary study. Therefore, we did not perform any formal sample size calculation. A database was generated in Excel for Mac and statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package of Social Scientists (SPSS) (IBM SPSS 20, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL), Paleontological Statistics Software (PAST) (Version 3.11 for Mac)48 and R studio (Version 1.3.959)49 statistical platforms. Continuous clinical data were expressed as mean (± SD) while categorical data were expressed as proportions.

Microbial richness and alpha diversity were expressed as Chao 1, and Shannon-H index, Evenness index, Fischer’s alpha respectively based on the species level abundance. The data were represented as box and whisker plots generated in ggplot2 package for R. Beta diversity was assessed by principal coordinate analysis calculating the Euclidean distance matrix. Per sample rarefaction curves were constructed using the MicrobiomeAnalyst online platform based on minimum library depth after normalization to rule out artifacts, as per the method described by Weiss et al.50. The initial comparison among the microflora in all the groups were made using the absolute abundance /counts of the taxa in each group. Principal Component analysis (PCA) with convex hulls was created to evaluate the intergroup differences and the groups were compared by one-way permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using 10,000 permutations with species abundance values in PAST (PAleontological STatistics software, Mac version 3.11). Significant differences in the microbiome profiles were tested using the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test (KW) followed by Tukey’s post-hoc pairwise analyses in SPSS with Bonferroni corrections for multiple hypothesis testing. Relative abundances of the different taxonomic levels, (i.e. phylum, class, order, family, genus and species) were expressed by box and whisker plots. Heatmaps were constructed based on the abundance value for microbes and area value of the peaks detected by GCMS for metabolites in R script based Metaboanalyst 4.0 and Heatmapper data expression tools51,52. The correlation matrices were generated using Spearman correlation in SPSS and the matrices were visualized as corrograms with the R script based STHDA online platform53. Venn diagram was used to express common genera among the different groups using the Venn diagram maker54. Microbiome-metabolome correlation networks were generated using Cytoscape v 3.855. The pathway enrichment plots were generated using the MetaboAnalyst v.4.0.
