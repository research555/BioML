Diet–microbiome–disease: Investigating diet’s influence on infectious disease resistance through alteration of the gut microbiome

Abiotic and biotic factors can affect host resistance to parasites. Host diet and host gut microbiomes are two increasingly recognized factors influencing disease resistance. In particular, recent studies demonstrate that (1) particular diets can reduce parasitism; (2) diets can alter the gut microbiome; and (3) the gut microbiome can decrease parasitism. These three separate relationships suggest the existence of indirect links through which diets reduce parasitism through an alteration of the gut microbiome. However, such links are rarely considered and even more rarely experimentally validated. This is surprising because there is increasing discussion of the therapeutic potential of diets and gut microbiomes to control infectious disease. To elucidate these potential indirect links, we review and examine studies on a wide range of animal systems commonly used in diet, microbiome, and disease research. We also examine the relative benefits and disadvantages of particular systems for the study of these indirect links and conclude that mice and insects are currently the best animal systems to test for the effect of diet-altered protective gut microbiomes on infectious disease. Focusing on these systems, we provide experimental guidelines and highlight challenges that must be overcome. Although previous studies have recommended these systems for microbiome research, here we specifically recommend these systems because of their proven relationships between diet and parasitism, between diet and the microbiome, and between the microbiome and parasite resistance. Thus, they provide a sound foundation to explore the three-way interaction between diet, the microbiome, and infectious disease.

Parasites can severely reduce host fitness, and host defenses against parasites are under strong selection. Hosts and parasites are often studied as pair-wise interactions [1] without considering the environment in which they interact [2]. This is problematic because biotic and abiotic factors can have strong effects on host resistance to parasitic infection [3,4]. One increasingly recognized environmental factor that influences disease is host diet (Fig 1). Host diet also importantly shapes the gut microbiome in a wide range of hosts (Fig 2).

The potential for diet to alter infectious disease resistance by altering the gut microbiome is relevant to a wide variety of animal systems, including humans. In particular, given increasing calls to create personalized diets to augment human gut microbiomes [12], it is crucial to determine how such changes in diet will make hosts more or less susceptible to infectious disease agents. Because our focus is on infectious diseases, we define parasites as microorganisms that can cause infectious disease (bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses). The goal of this review is to provide guidelines to study how diets indirectly change infectious disease resistance by altering the gut microbiome and to suggest suitable model systems to address this question. Using key references that have relevance across taxa, we begin by reviewing the aforementioned two-way relationships. We then discuss the challenges that need to be overcome to specifically integrate these separate relationships into a cohesive framework. Finally, we synthesize methods by which we can empirically test this potential three-way interaction. Our review and recommendations are not meant to be exhaustive but rather to provide a step towards advancing our understanding of how a host’s diet and gut microbiome interact to drive infectious disease resistance.

Certain diets have been shown to confer protection against infectious diseases in multiple animal systems. Specifically, many animals can obtain antiparasitic diets by eating plants with toxic defensive chemicals. Nematode-infected chimpanzees, for example, eat bitter plants with nematocidal compounds [13,14], and woolly bear caterpillars infected with parasitoid flies increase their consumption of diet alkaloids, reducing infection [15]. Similarly, monarch butterfly larvae suffer less protozoan infection when feeding on milkweed plants with high concentrations of cardiac glycosides [16–19], anicia checkerspot butterflies are more immunocompetent when fed plants with higher concentrations of iridoid glycosides [20], and bumblebees that consume alkaloid-rich nectar experience reduced infection with trypanosome gut parasites [21,22]. Thus, many herbivores exploit plant defensive chemistry to reduce parasite infection and growth.

Thus, diets can confer protection against infectious diseases by direct interference through chemical inhibition of parasites or modulation of available resources to fight pathogens. Alternatively, diets may confer protection through alteration of microbial competition, which until recently has been largely overlooked and which we will address next.

As with other ecological communities, gut microbial communities are groups of interacting species that occur together at the same time in a defined place. Recent technological advances have increased the feasibility of studying gut community composition and function [30,31]. Gut microbial communities have a structure that is characterized by species richness (the number of species), species evenness (the relative abundance of each species), and species diversity (a metric accounting for both species richness and evenness). Because different microbial species can have diverse roles, the overall function of these communities is typically characterized by assaying total genetic content (metagenomics) and gene expression (transcriptomics).

Diet also strongly influences microbial communities of bees, butterflies, and moths. Bee gut microbial communities are dominated by eight dominant bacterial phylotypes (bacterial clusters based on sequence similarity) that can be modified with alternative syrup and pollen diets [33,75]. Similarly, the dependence of gut microbial community composition on alternative larval host plants is widespread in lepidopteran species [76–79]. For example, tobacco budworm larvae fed three alternative host plants have significantly different bacterial families [76], and there is variation in bacterial phylotypes in the gypsy moth microbiome based on alternative plant diets [80]. Although these examples demonstrate that diet affects the gut microbiome in many animal systems, the mechanisms by which this occurs are largely unknown (Box 1).

Microbial symbionts, microbes that form a long-term association with hosts, can play important roles in animal health, particularly in mitigating infectious diseases. For example, aphids harbor non-gut-associated bacterial symbionts that protect them against fungal pathogens and parasitoid wasps [81,82]. Similarly, beewolf wasps incorporate symbiotic bacteria into their larval cocoons for protection against pathogenic fungi [83,84], and salamanders have skin bacterial symbionts that produce antifungal metabolites against chytrid fungus [85]. It is now clear that gut-associated microbial symbionts can also play major roles in infectious disease dynamics, with changes in microbial community structure and function being correlated with parasite infection in several systems. These community structural changes can be caused by dysbiosis (or disruption of the “healthy” microbiome) or parasite infection. Although both states have the potential to shift parasite resistance, their mechanisms can be different. In the case of dysbiosis, gut pathogens may exploit an empty niche or host physiological stress to successfully colonize the gut. Systemic parasites may exploit organism stress to disseminate and replicate throughout the body. A well-known example is microbial-conferred protection against the bacterium C. difficile, which is a leading cause of chronic diarrhea following the long-term use of antibiotics in humans. Antibiotic-induced disturbance of the gut microbial community favors the increased growth of C. difficile and recurrent infection. Clinical microbiome transplants via feces (i.e., fecal transplants) from healthy donors can be used to treat the disease in infected recipients by restoring the gut community [86–89]. Hence, C. difficile infection exploits dysbiosis by proliferating in the gut bacterial community and shows that community composition and potentially the number of bacteria are crucially important in affecting parasite invasion success. Similarly, sterile sugar–fed and antibiotic-treated bees suffer increased trypanosome infection relative to bees with a complete gut microbiome, and fecal transplants restore the bees’ gut microbiota and increase resistance [90]. Although the protective effect of the gut microbiome against parasites is evident in these and other systems, the properties of the microbiome that reduce parasitism are rarely known.

Sometimes it is not the presence of the gut microbial community or presence of particular taxa in that community but rather the expressed genes of the community that have a modulatory effect on protection. For example, laboratory mice can harbor gut bacteria that express glycan surface proteins. These glycan surface proteins elicit glycan-specific antibodies that attack Plasmodium spp. during transmission from Anopheles mosquitoes to mice lacking the glycan surface protein gene [105]. Similarly, mice colonized with Bifidobacterium breve bacteria expressing exopolysaccharides have significantly less colonization and persistence of a murine bacterial pathogen compared with mice without bacteria expressing an expolysaccharide gene [106]. The protective effect of B. breve is linked to a gene cluster responsible for the expression of exopolysaccharides. These two studies demonstrate that protection can be induced, or pathogenesis inhibited, by manipulating the gene expression of gut microbes. Importantly, given that bacteria can horizontally transfer genes, protection against parasitic infection conferred by expressed genes has the potential to persist in a microbial community independent of the presence of particular taxa. However, these scenarios are not exhaustive nor mutually exclusive. For example, in bees, high community diversity, high bacterial abundance, and taxa presence all contribute to protection against a trypanosome parasite [107].

As is clear from the previous examples, diets alter both parasite resistance and gut microbiomes in a range of animals. Because the microbiome is an important driver of parasite resistance, these relationships suggest that diets may change parasite resistance through their effects on the gut microbiome. However, to our knowledge, the effect of the diet on infectious disease susceptibility through their impact on the microbiome has not been unequivocally demonstrated in any system. Nonhuman animal systems that have separately demonstrated that diet alters resistance to parasites, diet alters the gut microbiome, and the gut microbiome alters parasitism are ideal systems to empirically test for the potential of diet altering disease resistance by modulating the gut microbiome. To fully explore this link, researchers must study diet, the microbiome, and disease in tandem in a controlled, experimental setting. The best case studies, based on current literature, appear to be experimentally tractable insect and mouse systems (Fig 2, Box 2).

One study on mouse malaria investigated the three relationships that are the focus of this review: (1) diet alters disease resistance; (2) diets alter gut microbiomes; and (3) gut microbiomes modulate disease resistance [7]. This study first found that genetically inbred mice (C57BL/6) infected with Plasmodium significantly differed in parasite burden based on mouse vendor source. Mice from Jackson Laboratory (Jax) and Taconic (Tac) had a significantly lower number of parasites and no mortality compared with National Cancer Institute/Charles River (NCI) and Harlan (Har) mice. To test whether diet increases resistance to malarial infection, Jax (resistant) and NCI (susceptible) mice were fed two commercial chow diets: NIH-31 and Teklad 22/5. Although parasitemia was not affected in susceptible NCI mice fed these diets, the Teklad 22/5 diet significantly increased parasitemia and mortality in resistant Jax mice compared with the NIH-31 diet. This study also demonstrated that the alternative diets affect the gut microbial community composition: Jax mice fed the Teklad 22/5 diet had lower relative abundance of the bacterial family Peptostreptococcaceae compared with Jax mice fed the NIH-31 diet. The researchers then used fecal transplants, microbial supplementation, and immune assays to demonstrate that the gut microbiome reduces parasitism. However, instead of carrying out this study with mice of similar origin fed on alternative diets, the researchers used mice that varied in resistance due to different vendor origin (Jax and Tac versus NCI and Har). Thus, while suggestive of an indirect link, this study did not yet unequivocally demonstrate that diets altered disease resistance by modulating the gut microbiome.

In order to study the potential effect of diet-altered protective gut microbiomes on infectious disease, we propose several recommendations. First, studies should only use animal systems in which host diet increases resistance to tractable parasites. Second, host genetics should be carefully controlled. Ideally, host genetics can be controlled by testing individuals with identical or similar genetic backgrounds, such as monozygotic twins or full siblings. Alternatively, unrelated individuals can be partitioned across treatments to reduce confounding factors. Third, it is important to determine whether alternative diets are associated with alterations of the microbial community and if so, to try and elucidate whether the same dietary components are responsible for altering parasite resistance. Fourth, it should be demonstrated directly, through a unified study, that gut microbial community variation caused by alternative diets correlates with disease susceptibility. A particularly powerful approach for this test is to use fecal transplants [7,44,90]. Beyond demonstrating that the actual altered microbiome provides resistance to parasites, carefully manipulated fecal transplants can also be used to elucidate whether the presence of the entire gut community is needed for protection or whether the presence and abundance of particular taxa are more important. To tease apart the protective mechanism of species presence and interactions, cultivated microbial transplants of specific community members have been effective in bees, mosquitoes, and mice [7,92,104]. Silencing microbial community members’ genes is also an effective way to resolve whether the presence and expression of certain genes are responsible for the protective mechanism of the gut microbiome, as shown in mice [105,106]. Finally, for animal systems with robust genetic tools, including mosquitoes and moths, both host immune genes and microbiome toxin genes can be silenced to determine their interplay [6,108,109].

Existing studies suggest that diets can alter host resistance to parasites by modulating the gut microbiome, but conclusive studies remain lacking. Although an understanding of diet–microbiome–disease interactions is critical for humans, we propose alternative animal model systems to test fundamental properties of this potential interaction. These animals are relevant to agriculture and epidemiology, and they allow for carefully controlled experiments with few constraints on sample size. Most importantly, they are tractable systems that have strong evidence of each separate interaction: diets modulate resistance to parasites, diets alter gut microbiomes, and gut microbiomes modulate parasitism (Fig 2). Existing experimental tools now allow researchers to build on the separate, direct relationships to determine whether there is an indirect link between host diet, host gut microbiome, and parasite infection. Elucidation of the importance and ubiquity of such a link will help us better understand the therapeutic potential of diets and gut microbiomes to control infectious disease.
