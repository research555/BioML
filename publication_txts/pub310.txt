Hybrid metagenome assemblies link carbohydrate structure with function in the human gut microbiome

Complex carbohydrates that escape small intestinal digestion, are broken down in the large intestine by enzymes encoded by the gut microbiome. This is a symbiotic relationship between microbes and host, resulting in metabolic products that influence host health and are exploited by other microbes. However, the role of carbohydrate structure in directing microbiota community composition and the succession of carbohydrate-degrading microbes, is not fully understood. In this study we evaluate species-level compositional variation within a single microbiome in response to six structurally distinct carbohydrates in a controlled model gut using hybrid metagenome assemblies. We identified 509 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) belonging to ten bacterial classes and 28 bacterial families. Bacterial species identified as carrying genes encoding starch binding modules increased in abundance in response to starches. The use of hybrid metagenomics has allowed identification of several uncultured species with the functional potential to degrade starch substrates for future study.

Microbial diversity within the microbiome and its interactions with host health and nutrition are now widely studied1. An important role of the human gut microbiome is the metabolic breakdown of complex carbohydrates derived from plants and animals (e.g. legumes, seeds, tissue and cartilage)2. Short-chain fatty acids are the main products of carbohydrate fermentation by gut microbiota and provide a myriad of health benefits through their systemic effects on host metabolism3,4. However, we still do not have a complete picture of the range of microbial species involved in the fermentation of complex carbohydrates to produce short-chain fatty acids. Understanding the intricacies of complex carbohydrate metabolism by the gut microbiota is a substantial challenge. The function of many ‘hard to culture species’ remains obscure and while advances in sequencing technology are beginning to reveal the true diversity of the human gut microbiota, there is still much to be learned5.

To achieve species-level resolution of the microbes present in the gut microbiome during complex carbohydrate utilisation, we conducted a genome-resolved metagenomics study in a controlled gut colon model. In vitro fermentation systems have been used extensively to model changes in the gut microbial community because of external inputs, e.g. changes in pH, protein, and carbohydrate supply7,18,19. We measured the dynamic changes in bacterial populations during fermentation of six structurally contrasting substrates: two highly recalcitrant starches (native Hylon VII (Hylon) and native potato starch (Potato)); two accessible starches (native normal maize starch (N. maize) and gelatinised then retrograded maize starch (R. maize); an insoluble fibre (cellulose) resistant to fermentation (Avicel); and a highly fermentable soluble fibre (Inulin). By generating hybrid assemblies using PromethION and NovaSeq data, we obtained 509 MAGs. The dereplicated set consisted of 151 genomes belonging to ten bacterial classes and 28 bacterial families. Using genome-level information and read proportions data, we identified several species that have putative starch-degrading properties.

Fermentation of six contrasting carbohydrate substrates (Inulin, Hylon, N. maize, Potato, R. maize and Avicel; see methods section) was initiated by inoculation of the model colon with a carbohydrate and faecal material and the gut microbial community composition was monitored over time (0, 6, 12 and 24 h) by sequencing as shown in Fig. 1. A more detailed workflow of the analyses is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. In total, 23 samples and negative control were sequenced.

The two sequencing runs generated 144 giga base pairs of raw sequences. In the first run, all 23 samples were analysed while in the second batch, 12 samples from Hylon, Inulin and R. maize were selected. The first run produced 7.87 million reads with an average read length of 3419 ± 57 bp and the second run generated 21.6 million reads with an average read length of 4707 ± 206 bp. Consolidating the runs, trimming and quality filtering resulted in the removal of 33.3 ± 14.7 % of reads (Supplementary Data 1). Median read lengths after trimming were 4972.5 ± 229 bp and the median quality score was 9.7 ± 0.9.

All 23 samples provided high-quality sequences (Q value >30) generating a mean of 27 million reads per sample. Quality and read length (<60 bp) filtering removed 2.96% of reads (Supplementary Data 1).

Hierarchical clustering for the taxonomic profiling using MetaPhlAn3 for each sample is shown in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 2. At baseline (0 h), profiles of the top 30 selected species by clustering (using Bray-Curtis distances for samples and species, and a complete linkage) is similar for all treatments, as expected (Fig. 2a). This uniform profile was distinct from the water control sample (a.k.a. ‘the kitome’). The water blank also had less than 3% (NovaSeq) and less than 0.2% (PromethION) reads compared to the other samples. The most abundant species in all the substrates was consistently Prevotella copri which decreased in abundance over time but remained one of the most abundant species throughout. Faecalibacterium praunitzii decreased in abundance in Inulin at 6 and 12 h and then increased in abundance for Inulin and Avicel at 24 h. Microbiome shifts were apparent from 6 h in the N. maize treatment which showed a very high abundance of E. coli (Fig.
2b and Supplementary Fig. 2). After 12 h, the profiles changed further with a higher abundance of Escherichia coli and Bifidobacterium animalis in the N. maize treatment. By the last sampling point (24 h), starch-specific species such as E. coli, Ruminococcus bromii, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. animalis showed an increase in abundance in Hylon, Potato and R. maize (Supplementary Fig. 2). E.scherichia coli showed the highest dominance in N. maize with a 17x greater abundance than at time 0 h.

With limited taxonomic shifts observed in Avicell treatment, very few genes showed distinct changes, mainly linked to cell wall remodelling and core microbial metabolism (Supplementary Data 10). There was a 1.5x shift from 0 to 6 h and a 1.2x shift from 0 to 24 h in an abundance of a 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase, which can breakdown products of cellulose, possibly indicating some very limited cellulose degradation. Inulin shows a broader range of enzymes involved in microbial cellular metabolism. A twofold increase in abundance of 1,5-anhydro-d-fructose reductase was observed, an enzyme potentially involved in the metabolism of products from inulin metabolism (Supplementary Data 11). N. maize shows a non-specific pattern of gene abundance due to the high levels of E.coli (Supplementary Data 12). The substrates Potato, Hylon and R. maize all show specific changes in gene abundances related to starch degradation (Supplementary Data 13–15). At 24 h, Hylon shows a twofold, and potato a 1.5-fold increase in alpha-amylase gene abundance. Potato (1.6-fold) and R. maize (1.5-fold) also show increased oligo-1,6-glucosidase involved in degrading the 1,6 branch points present in Potato and R. maize (but largely absent in Hylon). In addition to starch hydrolysing enzymes, this analysis also revealed increases in the abundance of a wide range of genes directly involved in acetyl-CoA and fatty acid metabolism for the Potato, R. maize and Hylon substrates. This may be linked to the production of high levels of short-chain fatty acids as an endpoint of the metabolism of these substrates.

Using Opera-MS, we combined PromethION reads with Illumina assemblies to produce hybrid assemblies. The assembly statistics for short-read-only and hybrid assemblies are shown in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 6. The longest N50 and the largest contig per treatment were generated using hybrid assemblies (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c). The overall length of assembled sequences was similar for both approaches (Supplementary Fig. 6d).

GTDb was used to propose bacterial taxonomy to the representative MAGs (Supplementary Data 17). All MAG clusters had >99% identity to existing genera (Supplementary Table 2). Here, 46 of the 151 MAG clusters were named using alphanumeric genus names and 19 MAGs clusters were named using alphanumeric species names. To provide clear and stable genus and species names, the MAGs were directly compared in NCBI to check whether these MAGs were already named or had any culture representatives. We identified 15 MAGs that were previously named and/or cultured so the Latin binomial for these MAGs was updated. For the rest of the MAGs, we used the approach described in Pallen et al.21 to provide Latin names to 53 MAG clusters (Supplementary Data 18). We have provided 12 genus names and 51 species names (Supplementary Note 1) to genomes previously not identified in NCBI. In addition, MAG assembly statistics for the MAGs in the present study was compared to the representative assemblies in GTDb (Supplementary Data 19). We found that while the average overall assembly length was almost similar (an average of 2,237,598 bp in the present study versus 2,533,373 bp in GTDb), there were far fewer contigs in our assemblies (an average of 68 contigs in the present study versus 162 in GTDb), and therefore our MAGs may be of higher quality than those present in reference databases.

Logarithmic fold change between time points of each MAG was calculated to estimate the changes in the relative abundance of the MAG between treatments (Supplementary Data 20). In total, 36 of 151 clusters exhibited ≥2x-log fold increase in relative abundance. Specifically, ≥2x-log fold change in abundance was seen in 6, 9, 12, 11 and 18 MAGs for Avicel, N. maize, Hylon, Potato and R. maize treatments, respectively. The genomes were partitioned as early (0 and 6 h) and late degraders (12 and 24 h) according to when they first showed an increase in relative abundance (Supplementary Table 3). We identified several genomes, to the best of our knowledge not previously identified as degraders of the different carbohydrate treatments (Fig. 4). Avicel is highly crystalline cellulose that is resistant to fermentation; the human gut microbiota has a very limited capacity to degrade celluloses22. Interestingly, the largest increase in abundance we observed was for Blautia hydrogenotrophica; which has been reported in association with cellulose fermentation since it acts as an acetogen using hydrogen produced by primary degraders of cellulose23. Bacteroides uniformis has been previously characterised as an inulin-degrading species24, and in our analysis, it was identified to increase from 12 h during inulin fermentation. In addition to this, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii increased in abundance with inulin supplementation and has been shown to have the ability to degrade inulin when co-cultured with primary degrading species25,26. Our analysis identified several well-known starch-degrading species, most notably R. bromii (Fig. 4). R. bromii was identified in the most recalcitrant starch treatments i.e., Hylon, Potato and R. maize treatments. Maize starch treatments (R. maize, N. maize and Hylon) showed increases in abundance of Bifidobacterium species. Previous studies have characterised Bifidobacterium as a starch-degrading genus27. The only Bifidobacterium species to increase in abundance in response to Hylon was B. adolescentis, which is known to utilise this hard-to-digest starch better than other Bifidobacterium species28; a broader range of Bifidobacterium species increased in abundance in response to the more accessible R. maize and N. maize substrates, suggesting these species may be better adapted to more accessible starches. In the Potato treatment, another closely related but less well-characterised Rumminococcus species, Candidatus Ruminococcus anthropic was identified.

Aggregation of relative abundance from each treatment showed the activity of the microbiome between each time point at a MAG level (Supplementary Fig. 7). Relative abundance was constant for Avicel throughout, indicating low activity of the MAGs in utilising crystalline cellulose, likely reflecting the very limited fermentability of microcrystalline cellulose. As for other maize starches (Hylon, R. maize and N. maize), the read proportions showed an overall reduction in abundance, with only starch-degrading MAGs increasing in abundance.

To identify CAZymes in the MAGs, genome-predicted proteins identified by Prodigal were compared with the CAZy database using dbCAN2 (Supplementary Data 21, Supplementary Fig. 8). We further analysed the genome organisation of the CAZymes identified by dbCAN2 using the tool PULpy29, which identified Polysaccharide Utilisation Loci (PULs) in a total of 21 MAGs (Supplementary Data 22). All the PULs identified were within the phylum Bacteroidetes, and the most PULs identified within a single MAG was 79 found in Butyricimonas faecihominis. These statistics for the numbers of PULs identified are comparable to other studies published using the same tool17. In MAGs that showed a larger than 2-log fold change, CAZyme counts specifically for Glycoside hydrolases (GH) and Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM) for all clusters showed a high representation of the profiles with GH13, GH2 and GH3 accounting for 34.1% of all counts (Supplementary Data 23 and Fig. 5). We identified a large representation of the amylolytic (starch degrading) gene family GH13 in Hylon (counts = 88), Potato (counts = 50) and R. maize (counts = 77) treatments. As expected, GH13 was weakly represented in Avicel (counts = 19) and Inulin (counts = 29) treatments (Fig. 5). The presence of GH13 in MAGs was closely associated with CBM48, which is commonly appended to starch-degrading GH13 enzymes30. By aggregating the CAZyme counts of MAGs per treatment, the accessible (N. maize and R. maize) and recalcitrant starches (Hylon and Potato) showed large increases in the proportion of GH13, GH133, GH31, GH57, GH77, CBM34 and CBM48, especially in early degraders compared to their proportions in Inulin and Avicell reflecting selection for starch-degrading species (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 9).

In total we identified several genomes, to the best of our knowledge, not previously identified as degraders of the different carbohydrate treatments (Supplementary Data 17 and Supplementary Table 3). Although six genomes were identified as associated with the degradation of cellulose, none contained any characteristic cellulose-active CAZy genes indicating multiple cross-feeders. Collinsella aerofaciens_J (cluster 29_1), Candidatus Minthovivens enterohominis (cluster 81_1) are genomes not previously identified in NCBI and that showed a 2x-log fold increase when in the presence of inulin and harboured multiple copies of inulinases (GH32). Bacteroides uniformis was identified during inulin fermentation to have three copies of the GH32 (inulinase) gene and a gene encoding the inulin binding domain, CBM38. The GH32 and CBM38 genes present in this MAG were found to be organised into a single PUL in the genome of Bacteroides uniformis with the organisation: GH32-GH32;CBM38-unk-GH32-GH32-susD-susC, providing further evidence that these genes are likely to be involved in inulin degradation (Supplementary Data 22). Candidatus Minthovivens enterohominis also increased in abundance early in inulin degradation, and its genome contained five copies of the GH32 gene. R. bromii is a well-characterised specialist on highly recalcitrant starch31, possessing specialised starch-degrading machinery termed the ‘amylosome’. Previous genome sequencing of an R. bromii isolate reported 15 GH13 genes31; 14 GH13 genes were identified in the R. bromii MAG assembled in this study. In the Potato treatment, a less well-characterised Rumminococcus species, Candidatus Ruminococcus anthropi with ten GH13 genes and one CBM48 gene was identified. A previously uncultured Blautia species, Candidatus Blautia hennigii, was identified possessing eight GH13 and three CBM48 genes, which increased in abundance in response to Hylon and Potato. Blautia species have previously been shown to increase in abundance in response to resistant starch32,33. We also identified four further previously uncharacterised species that increased in abundance and had more than five GH13 genes: Candidatus Cholicenecus caccae, Candidatus Eisenbergiella faecalis, Candidatus Enteromorpha quadrami and Candidatus Aphodonaster merdae.

To further investigate the potential for substrate specificity amongst the CAZyme profiles, we calculated the changes in abundance of each CAZyme over time, by taking the abundance of each MAG and the number of copies of each CAZyme per MAG. The results of this analysis are shown in Supplementary Data 24 and Supplementary Figs. 10–15. We then reasoned that the CAZymes that are likely to be most directly involved in the degradation of the substrates used in this study (large molecular weight polymers with limited or no solubility), would be secretory. Therefore, we filtered the results to only include CAZymes with a signal peptide cleavage site, indicating that these enzymes will follow an extracellular secretory route (Supplementary Figs. 16–21 and Supplementary Data 25). The results reveal distinct patterns for each of the substrates depending on their structure (Fig. 6). In common with the other analyses, Avicell shows changes in relatively few CAZymes, reflecting the limited fermentability of this substrate. Inulin and R.Maize, as highly accessible substrates, show changes in a wide range of different CAZymes, while the other substrates show a more restricted range of enzymes being selected for. As discussed in the previous section, all the starch substrates show an increase in GH13 genes of the alpha-amylase family, which are key starch-degrading enzymes.

As observed in the HUMAnN3 analysis, the Hylon starch showed the greatest increase in GH13 genes relative to the other substrates. The carbohydrate-binding modules display the clearest evidence of substrate specificity in this dataset. Except Avicell and Inulin (non-starch substrates), all four of the starch substrates indicate increases in CBM48, which is a starch binding protein commonly appended to GH13 family enzymes to assist with starch degradation30. The two most recalcitrant starches (Hylon and Potato), but none of the other substrates, also show increases in CBM74, which may be a specific mechanism to facilitate the degradation of highly recalcitrant starches34. CBM74 is present in several of the MAGs, which increase in abundance in response to Hylon and Potato starches; R. Bromii, Candidatus Blautia hennigii, Candidatus Ruminococcus anthropic, and Candidatus Colihabitans norwichensis.

Using a hybrid assembly approach (i.e. combining NovaSeq short-read and PromethION long-read metagenomic data), we report species-level resolved taxonomic data identifying distinct changes in microbiome composition in response to different substrates. The large number of high-quality near-complete MAGs that we generated using this approach enabled us to functionally annotate the CAZymes and PULs in the MAGs and identify potential carbohydrate-degrading species. Several of these species have not previously been identified as playing a role in starch fermentation (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 3).

We have demonstrated that deep long- and short-read metagenomic sequencing and hybrid assembly has great potential for studying the human gut microbiota. We identified species-level resolved changes in microbial community composition and diversity in response to carbohydrates with different structures over time, identifying the succession of species within the fermenter. To provide functional information about these species we obtained over 500 MAGs from a single human stool sample. Annotating CAZyme genes in MAGs from species enriched by fermentation of different carbohydrates allowed us to identify species specialised in the degradation of defined carbohydrates, increasing our knowledge of the range of species potentially involved in starch metabolism in the human gut.

A schematic overview of the workflow and experimental design is displayed in Fig. 1: a human faecal sample is used in a fermentation experiment with carbohydrate substrates, using a colon model to investigate carbohydrate degradation and its effect on the gut microbiota. Samples obtained from the colon model are used for short- and long-read metagenomics sequencing. Bioinformatics analyses include hybrid assembly, genome annotation, phylogenetic analysis and CAZyme annotation to characterise changes in the microbiome for different types of carbohydrate across time. A more detailed overview of the tools and bioinformatic analyses is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Native maize starch (catalogue no. S4126), native potato starch (catalogue no. 2004), Avicel PH-101 (catalogue no. 11365) and chicory inulin (catalogue no. I2255) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, (Gillingham, UK). Hylon VII® was kindly provided as a gift by Ingredion Incorporated (Manchester, UK).

Each substrate (0.500 ± 0.005 g, dry weight) was weighed in sterilised fermentation bottles (100 mL) prior to the start of the experiment.

A single human faecal sample was obtained from one adult (≥18 years old), a free-living, healthy donor who had not taken antibiotics in the 3 months prior to donation and was free from gastrointestinal disease. Ethical approval was granted by Human Research Governance Committee at the Quadram Institute (IFR01/2015) and London—Westminster Research Ethics Committee (15/LO/2169) and the trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02653001). Signed informed consent was obtained from the participant prior to donation. The stool sample was collected by the participant, stored in a closed container under ambient conditions, transferred to the laboratory and prepared for inoculation within 2 hours of excretion. The faecal sample was diluted 1:10 with pre-warmed, anaerobic, sterile phosphate buffer saline (0.1 M, pH 7.4) in a double meshed stomacher bag (500 mL, Seward, Worthing, UK) and homogenised using a Stomacher 400 (Seward, Worthing, UK) at 200 rpm for two cycles, each of 60 s length.

Fermentation vessels were established with media adapted from Williams et al.43. In brief, each vessel (100 mL) contained an aliquot (3.0 mL) of filtered faecal slurry, 82 mL of sterilised growth medium, and one of the six substrates for experimental evaluation: native Hylon VII or native potato starch (highly recalcitrant starches); native maize starch or gelatinised, retrograded maize starch (accessible starches); Avicel PH-101 (insoluble fibre; negative control); and chicory inulin (fermentable soluble fibre; positive control). There was also a media-only control with no inoculum (blank), making a total of seven fermentation vessels.

For each fermentation vessel, the growth medium contained 76 mL of basal solution, 5 mL vitamin phosphate and sodium carbonate solution, and 1 mL reducing agent. The composition of the various solutions used in the preparation of the growth medium is described in detail in Supplementary Note 2. A single stock (7 l) of growth medium was prepared for use in all vessels. Vessel fermentations were pH controlled and maintained at pH 6.8 to 7.2 using 1 N NaOH and 1 N HCl regulated by a Fermac 260 (Electrolab Biotech, Tewkesbury, UK). A circulating water jacket maintained the vessel temperature at 37 °C. Magnetic stirring was used to keep the mixture homogenous and the vessels were continuously sparged with nitrogen (99% purity) to maintain anaerobic conditions. Samples were collected from each vessel at 0 (5 min), 6, 12 and 24 h after inoculation. The biomass from two 1.8 mL aliquots from each sample were concentrated by refrigerated centrifugation (4 °C; 10,000 × g for 10 min), the supernatant removed, and the pellets stored at −80 °C prior to bacterial enumeration and DNA extraction; one pellet was used for enumeration and one for DNA extraction.

All materials used for bacterial cell enumeration were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, UK) unless specified otherwise. To each frozen pellet, 400 µL of Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and 1100 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde were added and gently thawed at 20 °C for 10 min with gentle mixing. Once thawed, each resuspension was thoroughly mixed and incubated overnight at 4 °C for fixation to occur. The resuspensions were then centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 × g, the supernatant removed, and the residual pellet washed with 1 mL 0.1% Tween-20. This pellet then underwent two further washes in PBS to remove any residual paraformaldehyde and was then resuspended in 600 µL PBS: ethanol (1:1).

The fixed resuspensions were centrifuged for 3 min at 16,000 × g, the supernatant removed, and the pellet resuspended in 500 µL 1 mg/mL lysozyme (100 µL 1 M Tris HCl at pH 8, 100 µL 0.5 M EDTA at pH 8, 800 μL water, and 1 mg lysozyme, catalogue no. L6876) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After thorough mixing and centrifugation for 3 min at 16,000 × g, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with PBS. The resulting pellet was then resuspended in 150 µL of hybridisation buffer (HB, per mL: 180 µL 5 M NaCl, 20 µL 1 M Tris HCl at pH 8, 300 µL Formamide, 499 µL water, 1 µL 10% SDS), centrifuged, the supernatant removed, and the remaining pellet resuspended again in 1500 µL of HB and stored at 4 °C prior to enumeration. For bacterial enumeration, 1 µL of Invitrogen SYTO 9 (catalogue no. S34854, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) was added to 1 mL of each fixed and washed resuspension. Within 96-well plate resuspensions were diluted to 1:1000 and the bacterial populations within them enumerated using flow cytometry (Luminex Guava easyCyte 5) at wavelength of 488 nm and Guava suite software, version 3.3.

Each pellet was resuspended in 500 μL (samples collected at 0 and 6 h) or 650 μL (samples collected at 12 and 24 h) with chilled (4 °C) nuclease-free water (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK). The resuspensions were frozen overnight at −80 °C, thawed on ice and an aliquot (400 μL) used for bacterial genomic DNA extraction. FastDNA® Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedical, Solon, US) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions which included two bead beating steps of 60 s at a speed of 6.0 m/s (FastPrep24, MP Biomedical, Solon, USA). DNA concentration was determined using the Quant-iT™ dsDNA Assay Kit, high sensitivity kit (Invitrogen, Loughborough, UK) and quantified using a FLUOstar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech, Aylesbury, UK).

Genomic DNA was normalised to 5 ng/µL with elution buffer (10 mM Tris HCl). A miniaturised reaction was set up using the Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit (Illumina, Cambridge, UK). 0.5 µL Tagmentation Buffer 1 (TB1) was mixed with 0.5 µL Bead-Linked Transposomes (BLT) and 4.0 µL PCR-grade water in a master mix and 5 µL was added to each well of a chilled 96-well plate. About 2 µL of normalised DNA (10 ng total) was pipette-mixed with each well of tagmentation master mix and the plate heated to 55 °C for 15 min in a PCR block. A PCR master mix was made up using 4 µL kapa2G buffer, 0.4 µL dNTP’s, 0.08 µL Polymerase and 4.52 µL PCR-grade water, from the Kap2G Robust PCR kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) and 9 µL added to each well in a 96-well plate. About 2 µL each of P7 and P5 of Nextera XT Index Kit v2 index primers (catalogue No. FC-131-2001 to 2004; Illumina, Cambridge, UK) were also added to each well. Finally, the 7 µL of Tagmentation mix was added and mixed. The PCR was run at 72 °C for 3 min, 95 °C for 1 min, 14 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 3 min. Following the PCR reaction, the libraries from each sample were quantified using the methods described earlier and the high sensitivity Quant-iT dsDNA Assay Kit. Libraries were pooled following quantification in equal quantities. The final pool was double-SPRI size selected between 0.5 and 0.7X bead volumes using KAPA Pure Beads (Roche, Wilmington, US). The final pool was quantified on a Qubit 3.0 instrument and run on a D5000 ScreenTape (Agilent, Waldbronn, DE) using the Agilent Tapestation 4200 to calculate the final library pool molarity. qPCR was done on an Applied Biosystems StepOne Plus machine. Samples quantified were diluted 1 in 10,000. A PCR master mix was prepared using 10 µL KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix (2X) (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK), 0.4 µL ROX High, 0.4 µL 10 μM forward primer, 0.4 µL 10 μM reverse primer, 4 µL template DNA, 4.8 µL PCR-grade water. The PCR programme was: 95 °C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s. Standards were made from a 10 nM stock of Phix, diluted in PCR-grade water. The standard range was 20, 2, 0.2, 0.02, 0.002, 0.0002 pmol. Samples were then sent to Novogene (Cambridge, UK) for sequencing using an Illumina NovaSeq instrument, with sample names and index combinations used. Demultiplexed FASTQ’s were returned on a hard drive.

Library preparation was performed using SQK-LSK109 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) with barcoding kits EXP-NBD104 and EXP-NBD114. The native barcoding genomic DNA protocol by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) was followed with slight modifications. Starting material for the End-Prep/FFPE reaction was 1 μg per sample in 48 μL volume. About 3.5 µL NEBNext FFPE DNA Repair Buffer (NEB, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA), 3.5 µL NEB Ultra II End-prep Buffer, 3 µL NEB Ultra II End-prep Enzyme Mix and 2 µL NEBNext FFPE DNA Repair Mix (NEB) were added to the DNA (final volume 60 µL), mixed slowly by pipetting and incubated at 20 °C for 5 min and then 65 °C for 5 min. After a 1X bead wash with AMPure XP beads (Agencourt, Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK), the DNA was eluted in 26 µL of nuclease-free water. About 22.5 µL of this was taken forward for native barcoding with the addition of 2.5 µL barcode and 25 µL Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix (NEB) (final volume 50 µL). This was mixed by pipetting and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After another 1X bead wash (as above), samples were quantified using Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Loughborough, UK). In the first run, samples were equimolar pooled to a total of 900 ng in a volume of 65 µL. In the second run, samples were pooled to 1700 ng followed by a 0.4X bead wash to achieve the final volume of 65 µL. About 5 µL Adaptor Mix II (ONT), 20 µL NEBNext Quick Ligation Reaction Buffer (5X) and 10 µL Quick T4 DNA Ligase (NEB) were added (final volume 100 µL), mixed by flicking, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After bead washing with 50 µL of AMPure XP beads and two washes in 250 µL of Long Fragment Buffer (ONT), the library was eluted in 25 µL of Elution Buffer and quantified with Qubit dsDNA BR and TapeStation 2200 using a Genomic DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Edinburgh, UK). About 470 ng of DNA was loaded for sequencing in the first run and 400 ng in the second run. The final loading mix was 75 µL SQB, 51 µL LB and 24 µL DNA library.

Sequencing was performed on a PromethION Beta using FLO-PRO002 PromethION Flow Cells (R9 version). The sequencing runtime was 57 h for Run 1 and 64 h for Run 2. Flow cells were refuelled with 0.5X SQB (75 µL SQB and 75 µL nuclease-free water) 40 h into both runs.

The bioinformatics analysis was performed using default options unless specified otherwise.

Basecalling was performed using Guppy version 3.0.5 + 45c3543 (ONT) in high accuracy mode (model dna_r9.4.1_450bps_hac), and demultiplexed with qcat version 1.1.0 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, https://github.com/nanoporetech/qcat).

For Nanopore, sequence metrics were estimated by Nanostat version 1.1.244. In total, 22 million sequences were generated with a median read length of 4500 bp and median quality of 10 (phred). Quality trimming and adaptor removal was performed using Porechop version 0.2.3 (https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop). For Illumina, quality control was done for paired-end reads using fastp, version 0.20.045 to remove adaptor sequences and filter out low-quality (phred quality <30) and short reads (length <60 bp). After quality control, the average number of reads in the samples was over 26.1 million reads, with a minimum of 9.7 million reads; the average read length was 148 bp.

Trimmed and high-quality short reads are processed using MetaPhlAn3 version 3.0.246 to estimate both microbial composition to species level and also the relative abundance of species from each metagenomic sample. MetaPhlAn3 uses the latest marker information dataset, CHOCOPhlAn 2019, which contains ~1 million unique clade-specific marker genes identified from ~100,000 reference genomes; this includes bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic genomes. Hclust2 was used to plot the hierarchical clustering of the different taxonomic profiles at each time point [https://github.com/SegataLab/hclust2]. The results of the microbial taxonomy were analysed in RStudio Version 1.1.453 (http://www.rstudio.com/).

Gene abundance was calculated using the HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network programme HUMAnN347. The output of the HUMAnN3 pipeline was normalised to copies per million (cpm) to facilitate comparisons between samples with different read depths and regrouped into MetaCyc reaction abundances for analysis. Fold changes were calculated between the cpm counts at time 0 h to the corresponding counts at 6, 12 and 24 h using gtools R package version 3.5.0. A threshold of 1.5x was regarded as an active metabolic gene pathway.

Trimmed and high-quality Illumina reads were merged for each treatment, and then used in a short-read-only assembly using Megahit version 1.1.348,49. Then OPERA-MS version 0.8.214 was used to combine the short-read-only assembly with high-quality long reads, to create high-quality hybrid assemblies. By combining these two technologies, OPERA-MS overcomes the issue of low-contiguity of short-read-only assemblies and the low base-pair quality of long-read-only assemblies.

The hybrid co-assemblies from Opera-MS14 were used for binning. Here, Illumina reads for each time period were mapped to the co-assembled contigs to obtain a coverage map. Bowtie2 version 2.3.4.1 was used for mapping, and samtools to convert SAM to BAM format. MaxBin2 version 2.2.650 and MetaBat2 version 2.12.151 which uses sequence composition and coverage information, were used to bin probable genomes using default parameters. The binned genomes and co-assembled contigs were integrated into Anvi’o version 6.152 for manual refinement and visual inspection of problematic genomes. We used the scripts: ‘anvi-interactive’ to visualise the genome bins; ‘anvi-run-hmms’ to estimate genome completeness and contamination; ‘anvi-profile’ to estimate coverage and detection statistics for each sample; and ‘anvi-refine’ to manually refine the genomes. All scripts were run using default parameters. Additionally, DAS tool version 1.1.253 was used to aggregate high-quality genomes from each treatment by using single copy gene-based scores and genome quality metrics to produce a list of good-quality genomes for every treatment. CheckM version 1.0.1854 was used on all final genomes to confirm completion and contamination scores. In general, genomes with a ‘quality satisfying completeness - 5*contamination >50 score’ and/or with a ‘>60% completion and <10% contamination’ score according to CheckM, were selected for downstream analyses.

In order to produce a dereplicated set of genomes across all treatments, dRep version 2.5.055 was used. Pairwise genome comparisons or Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) was used for clustering. dRep clusters genomes with ANIs of 97% were regarded as primary clusters. Further the genomes are clustered to an ANI of 99%. These unique genomes are regarded as secondary clusters. A representative genome is provided for each of the secondary clusters.

Genome bins that passed quality assessment were analysed for their closest taxonomic annotation. To assign taxonomic labels, the genome set was assigned into the microbial tree of life using GTDB version 0.3.5 and database R95 to identify the closest ancestor and obtain a putative taxonomy assignment for each genome bin. For genomes where the closest ancestor could not be determined, the Relative Evolutionary Distance (RED) to the closest ancestor and taxa names were provided to taxa not previously identified in NCBI. Using these genome bins, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using Phylophlan version 0.99 and visually inspected using iTOL version 4.3.1 and ggtree from package https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/ggtree.git. The R packages ggplot2 version 3.3.2, dplyr version 1.0.2, aplot, ggtree version 2.2.4 and inkscape version 1.0.1 were used for illustrations.

Since co-assemblies were used for binning, it was possible to calculate the proportion of reads recruited to the MAG across all time periods for each treatment. The relative abundance provides an estimate of which time point recruited the most proportion of reads. To provide this estimate in relative terms, the value was normalised to the total number of reads that was recruited for that genome. The time 0 h sample for Avicell was not available, so a mean relative abundance from the other samples (representing the same starting inoculum) at time 0 h was used to represent 0 h for Avicell. The relative abundance scores were provided by ‘anvi-summarise’ (from the Anvi’o package) as relative abundance. Further, fold changes were calculated between the relative abundance at time 0 h to the corresponding relative abundance at 6, 12 and 24 h using gtools R package version 3.5.0. Fold changes provide an estimate of change in MAG abundance, which might be a result of utilisation of a particular carbohydrate. Fold changes were converted to log ratios. MAGs with a fold change of 2x (log2 fold change = 1) were regarded as an active carbohydrate utiliser.

All representative genome clusters were annotated for CAZymes using dbCAN56. The genome’s nucleotide sequences were processed with Prodigal to predict protein sequences, and then three tools were used for automatic CAZyme annotation: (a) HMMER57 to search against the dbCAN HMM (Hidden Markov Model) database; (b) DIAMOND58 to search against the CAZy pre-annotated CAZyme sequence database; and (c) Hotpep59 to search against the conserved CAZyme PPR (peptide pattern recognition) short peptide library. To improve annotation accuracy, a filtering step was used to retain only hits to CAZy families found by at least two tools. PULs were identified in MAGs using the tool PULpy29 with the default settings. The R packages ggplot2, dplyr, ComplexHeatmap version 2.4.3 and inkscape were used for illustrations.

Principle Coordinate analyses using the pcoa function in the ape package version 5.3 (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ape/versions/5.3) and the vegan package were used to identify differences in microbiome profiles amongst treatments using the diversity analyses. To calculate the distances between the microbiomes at different time points, the permdisp test was performed using the betadisper function from the taxonomy profiles from vegan. Significance testing between the distances was calculated using ANOVA.
