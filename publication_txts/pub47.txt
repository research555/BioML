Time‐limited diets and the gut microbiota in cardiometabolic disease

In recent years, intermittent fasting (IF), including periodic fasting and time‐restricted feeding (TRF), has been increasingly suggested to constitute a promising treatment for cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). A deliberate daily pause in food consumption influences the gut microbiome and the host circadian clock, resulting in improved cardiometabolic health. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which circadian host‐microbiome interactions affect host metabolism and immunity may add a potentially important dimension to effective implementation of IF diets. In this review, we discuss emerging evidence potentially linking compositional and functional alterations of the gut microbiome with IF impacts on mammalian metabolism and risk of development of hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, and their long‐term micro‐ and macrovascular complications. We highlight the challenges and unknowns in causally linking diurnal bacterial signals with dietary cues and downstream metabolic consequences and means of harnessing these signals toward future microbiome integration into precision medicine.

Highlights

Cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), mainly encompassing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and type 2 diabetes ( T2D ), are rapidly increasing in prevalence worldwide. 1 , 2 In parallel, human eating behavior has dramatically changed over the past decades. The traditional breakfast‐lunch‐dinner pattern has been replaced by frequent snacking, large nighttime meals, and breakfast skipping. 3 , 4 Such irregular eating patterns may have an adverse effect on cardiometabolic risk factors, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia, 4 thus contributing to the rising prevalence of T2D. 1 In contrast, intentional eating with awareness of the timing and frequency of eating occasions could improve lifestyle and cardiometabolic risk factor management, 5 which can protect against the development of T2D and CVDs. 6 , 7

In rodents, a dampened gut microbiome oscillation was observed under high‐fat diet, jet lag, and in Per1/2‐deficient mice. 72 , 73 , 74 , 99 Under any of these conditions, mice also exhibit disruptions of biological clock gene expression and arrhythmic behavior and are subsequently prone to metabolic abnormalities. 109 , 110 , 111 Interestingly, limiting the feeding time of these circadian‐disrupted mice with TRF alleviates their metabolic abnormalities 29 , 112 and also restores their gut microbiome rhythm. 72 , 74 , 84 In line with these studies in rodents, it is possible that modulating the diurnal rhythms of the gut microbiome by IF diets could be developed in the future as a valuable tool to promote health and treat metabolic disorders in humans. However, it is challenging to generalize the findings from murine data to humans, because of a large intervariability between humans in clinical studies undergoing IF diets, variations in fasting:feeding duration and variations in the caloric content of the diet given to the participants and their corresponding control groups as mentioned previously. Another major difference between rodent and human studies results from the source of the microbial sampling. Because of accessibility considerations, most human studies are conducted on stool samples. Stool samples, however, do not represent mucosal microbes that have been linked to circadian programming. 73 Nevertheless, a loss of diurnal rhythms in the gut microbiome obtained from stool samples has been reported in both humans and rodents. 85 , 100 , 113 With respect to dietary patterns, it has been reported that IF restructured the stool microbiome of diabetic mice resulting in altered bacterial configuration compared to control mice. 85 Therefore, despite possible discrepancies arising from limited information on mucosal‐associated bacteria in different parts of the gut, stool samples may still offer some valid information. Collectively, the role of the bacterial rhythmicity in cardiometabolic health and diseases should be further investigated.

Fluctuations in food availability affect the entire ecosystem, including host and symbiotic communities, and have profound implications on cardiometabolic health. In this section, we highlight some of the remarkable discoveries about the microbiome's role in IF, which in turn influence metabolic manifestations related to CMDs such as obesity, hyperglycemia, and hypertension.

Blood pressure. Hypertension refers to persistently high arterial blood pressure that, if left untreated, can lead to a number of devastating consequences such as heart failure and peripheral vascular disease. 141 Although no cure for primary hypertension is currently available, hypertension is controllable by chronic antihypertensive medical treatment coupled with lifestyle modifications. 142 There are several indications that IF and meal timing may contribute to improved hypertension in mice and humans. 11 , 18 , 143 , 144 , 145 With these observations notwithstanding, the validity of IF on blood pressure has been questioned in a number of randomized controlled studies with large numbers of participants, showing that IF, ADF, or 5:2 diet have no additive effect on blood pressure. 21 , 23 , 25 Although the effectiveness of IF is debatable, the DASH diet, which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, offers a low sodium diet that may reduce hypertension. 146 , 147 A recent study suggested that a five‐day fast followed by a modified DASH diet reduces systolic blood pressure in patients with hypertensive metabolic syndrome. 147 This fasting regime also altered the gut microbiome, including several bacterial communities and genes associated with SCFA production. 147 Within the IF group in this study, a prediction of sustained systolic blood pressure response was performed using machine‐learning analysis of baseline microbiome data, identifying Desulfovibrionaceae, Hydrogenoanaerobacterium, Akkermansia, and Ruminococcaceae as potential contributors to controlled hypertension. 147 In rats, five weeks of ADF regime significantly reduced blood pressure in hypertensive stroke‐prone animals. 69 This phenotypic change was accompanied by altered microbiome configuration including elevated Bacteroides uniformis, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus johnsonii. Mechanistically, the ADF diet was associated with a microbial shift toward bacteria producing secondary bile acids, both conjugated and unconjugated (such as taurolithocholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, tauroursodeoxycholic acid [ TUDCA], LCA, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, and more), and activation of the bile acid receptor Takeda G protein‐coupled receptor 5 (TGR5; Figure
1). Moreover, treatment of these hypertensive rats with cholic acid or TGR5 agonist attenuated elevated blood pressure, thus exceeding the need for ADF. 69 Fecal transplantation from ADF‐fed rats to germ‐free rats prevented elevated systolic blood pressure, showing the causal role of the gut microbiome in lowering blood pressure. 69 Further studies need to define the target tissue and cell types that respond to the secondary bile acids as well as the cellular pathways induced by these bile acids, leading to the reduction in blood pressure. In addition, more trials are required to define the efficacy and sustainability of different IF diets in lowering blood pressure in patients with various cardiometabolic derangements.

CMDs are progressive diseases, demonstrating long‐term and devastating consequences. A common manifestation in T2D patients is microvascular complications that include retinopathy and nephropathy as well as macrovascular diseases such as CVDs. IF diets, as part of nutrition therapy, have emerged as a potential intervention for managing several long‐term complications of T2D, including retinopathy, cognitive decline, heart failure, and nephropathy (Figure 2).

Nephropathy. Kidney dysfunction or nephropathy as a result of diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease. 178 In diabetic patients, poor glycemic control and hypertension can lead to glomerular hyperfiltration, albuminuria, nephrotic proteinuria, and development of end‐stage renal disease. 179 , 180 , 181 Several studies have shown alterations in gut bacterial abundance in patients with diabetic nephropathy compared to controls, and overall lower bacterial diversity was correlated with disease progression. 182 , 183 , 184 In rodents, diabetic nephropathy was associated with altered bacterial communities and microbial metabolites like phenyl sulfate 185 , 186 and correlated with activation of the renin‐angiotensin system. 187 , 188 Several observational studies have tested the effect of Ramadan fasting on diabetic nephropathy severity, but none of them showed significant changes in renal functions. These reports were not randomized controlled studies, had small sample sizes, and contained patients with different medications or dialysis treatment. Furthermore, most of the studies were conducted in countries where fasting durations were 12‐14 h during the winter season and thus cannot be generalized to longer fasting durations. 189 Currently, the efficacy of IF on kidney functions and diabetic nephropathy and the involvement of the gut microbiome in this process have not been elucidated.

Recent studies report that during multiple IF diets, the intestinal microbiome may act as a signaling hub driving the improvement in cardiometabolic complications. However, there are several technical and conceptual obstacles that still need to be carefully taken into consideration in interpreting these studies. First, IF diets regimens are inconsistently defined across studies and the long‐term effects of IF diets were mostly undetermined. From the perspective of microbiome analyses, some studies are lacking a suitable availability of some microbial datasets and resources. Furthermore, microbiome sampling in most of the human studies analyze fecal samples and disregard regional differences in the gut microbiome composition and function along the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, some microbiome studies feature technical differences in data acquisition and analysis modalities (eg, sample allocation, extraction, or sequencing methods) differ between studies, making comparisons between their results challenging. There is also a global inability to generalize conclusions on microbiome structural alterations across human studies, due to differences between ethnical, geographical and demographical groups and variability in body mass index, sex, age, physical activity, and other clinical parameters of the participants in different studies. In addition to technical and human individual variabilities, other differences derived from personalized uniqueness of microbiome configurations constitute a formidable challenge in generalizing such results. However, the individualized microbiome heterogeneity is not necessarily a disadvantage, because it may allow for identification and development of personalized responses to various IF interventions and forms a basis (together with a variety of host clinical and laboratory features) for personalized nutrition.

The discovery that the gut microbiome may modulate the metabolic outcomes of IF diets may provide mechanistic explanations for the observed phenotypes as well as for the personal response to the IF regimens observed in different individuals exposed to a similar dietary intervention. Indeed, gut microbiome composition and function differ between humans and rodents following IF diets as compared to those following continuous food consumption. In addition to the altered bacterial configuration, IF collectively leads to bacterial production of specific metabolites such as secondary bile acids, SCFAs, and ketone bodies, which may have a distinct downstream impact on host physiology and disease. Although we highlight in this review how changes in microbial configuration and metabolite production may potentially influence the clinical outcomes of different cardiometabolic abnormalities, comprehensive future research is warranted to decipher the molecular and chemical processes that mediate these effects. In addition, further research is needed to address the effect of the microbiome on additional organs such as the lung, skin, muscles, and kidneys, whose functions could also be influenced by IF diets. 190 , 191 , 192 , 193 Moreover, it remains to be determiced what is the role of the IF‐microbiome axis in several T2D‐related complications, such as the susceptibility to fungal infections, 194 diabetic foot ulcers, and diabetic nephropathy, which account for high morbidity and mortality rates in T2D patients. 195 Another question is whether a combination of IF with a defined diet composition or food choice consumed in eating days (eg, the aforementioned 5:2 DASH diet 147 ) can provide targeted benefits for certain CMD‐related conditions. In this respect, it is worth noting that although the nutrient composition of the diet has a tremendous effect on the gut microbiome, 196 the impact on CMD has not been elucidated. Other factors such as digestibility and transit time can be modulated during multiple IF diets. However, their relevance to CMD is unclear.

The idea that the gut microbiome is affected by IF diets and affects normal host physiology and CMD progression allows using these findings as a potential basis for therapeutic intervention. Identification of bioactive microbial‐derived molecules potentially affecting human metabolism can be developed as a bona fide “postbiotic therapy,” bypassing the high interindividual variability of the microbiomes producing such molecules. One such example is SCFAs, which in rodents demonstrated beneficial effects on adipose tissue browning and energy expenditure, 118 secretion of GLP‐1 from L cells and glycemic control, 135 and cardiac functions. 172 Secondary bile acids are another example of bacterial molecules that showed beneficial cardiometabolic effects in mice, as exemplified by secondary bile acids that attenuated hypertension 69 and show protection against diabetic retinopathy 85 and cognitive impairments. 86 On the other hand, specific microbial products can induce worsened metabolic outcomes, such as TMAO that was involved in cardiac dysfunctions and associated with a higher risk for CVDs. 174 , 175 In many cases, these metabolites were modified during implementation of different IF diets (Figure 2) and contributed to the effect of IF on metabolic outcomes. An addition of the secondary bile acid TUDCA or an agonist of the bile acids receptor TGR5 led to protection from cognitive decline and retinopathy in diabetic mice, bypassing the need for IF diet, 85 , 86 whereas microbial enzyme inhibitors for TMAO 169 , 199 may alleviate cardiometabolic derangements. These and other microbiome‐based interventions merit further studies.
