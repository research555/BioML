Potential of multiomics technology in precision medicine

The ‘precision medicine’ refers to the generation of identification and classification criteria for advanced taxonomy of patients, exploiting advanced models to infer optimized clinical decisions for each disease phenotype.

The current article reviews new advances in the past 18 months on the microbiomics science intended as new discipline contributing to advanced ‘precision medicine’. Recently published data highlight the importance of multidimensional data in the description of deep disease phenotypes, including microbiome and immune profiling, and support the efficacy of the systems medicine to better stratify patients, hence optimizing diagnostics, clinical management and response to treatments.

The articles referenced in this review help inform the reader on new decision-support systems that can be based on multiomics patients’ data including microbiome and immune profiling. These harmonized and integrated data can be elaborated by artificial intelligence to generate optimized diagnostic pipelines and clinical interventions.

The term ‘precision medicine’ refers to the new sets of methodologies and approaches able to provide optimized stratification of patients, hence generating a new ‘definition’ of disease phenotypes. Despite its inflated usage, the definition is still often generic although already linked to important scientific and clinical expectations and even to the possibility of developing new health policies and strategies. However, we can state that the ‘precision medicine’ refers more appropriately to the generation of criteria for advanced taxonomy of patients, producing models to identify and classify clinical decisions for each disease phenotype. This new perspective of patient evaluation can use both basic laboratory and clinical data (i.e. discrete variables), and omics’ data (i.e. continuous variables) produced by new-generation sequencing or NGS, proteomics, metaproteomics, metabolomics, foodomics, immunomics (proteomics and integrated serology), lipidomics, microbiomics, all of them generating large-scale or big data (Fig.
1). These data are allowing researchers and clinicians to provide a broad spectrum of clinical, genetic, immunological information on the patient, his lifestyle (e.g. feeding, family and personal relationships and habits, sports activities, stress elements) and main interactions with the environment such as exposure to pathogens, nutrients, drugs, pollution, all variables constituting the exposome. These new indicators of the patient biological or clinical state may be considered, after validation processes typical of the systems medicine, biomarkers of the phenotype of the disease, and may allow to go beyond the classic semeiotics approach, overcoming signs and symptoms to decipher the disease. These ‘omics data’ are ‘multidimensional data’, exploiting numbers of patients, genomic and metagenomic sequences, metabolites, immunological profiles as whole matrices of patients’ meaningful variables. Once the data are ‘cataloged’, that is organized in architectural systems for reading usable data, they can be harmonized and, therefore, integrated, according to univariate and multivariate statistical models, borrowed by chemometrics, which is the science of relating the measurements made on a biological system or on a chemical process with the state of the system through the precise application of statistics. By using this approach, it is possible to move from hundreds of thousands of data to a few tens through a mechanism of self-scaling (harmonization) and reduction of multidimensionality until producing a framework of both structural and functional features of the biological system. By integrating the two characteristics, it is possible to provide a complete host-exposome set of data that can provide personalized information for each patient, without introducing the bias of the a-priori selection of clinical and laboratory data (‘targeted’ approach). When metadata on human microbiome are also considered, the entire microbiota-host-exposome phenotype can be generated for each patient, including microbiome profiling as enterophenotype that can complement the classical phenotype of the disease (metadata or phenomics data). At individual level microbiota-host-exposome data may act as diagnostic and prognostic tool, while at population level they can generate baseline profiling acting as prediction factor of disease. With this approach, the description of a pathophysiological state by representative variables is performed by an ‘untargeted’ approach, without any selection a priori. This allows researchers to consider the disease as a ‘system’ represented by as many variables or ‘features’ as possible that can be collocated in a ‘precise’ or ‘personalized’ picture of the clinical history of the patient, in the context of the ‘strict’ observed disease phenotype. Moving from omics’ or big data to precision medicine, through a process of fused data down to small data, the stratification of the patients can be tremendously improved, translating this process into a potential better health care. 

In a recent Nature article [1▪▪], the major modulating variables of a healthy human microbiota have been reported, showing that host genetics acts only in negligible quantity with respect to external stimuli and to modifications induced by environment (exposome). The growing availability of systems biology approaches to study intestinal microbiome has provided powerful and sophisticated analytical tools, allowing to produce multidimensional omics data (big data) able to describe without a-priori constraints a human microbiome, including variables associated with food [2▪]. The prediction of modulating effects on the symbiotic and dysbiotic state of the microbial ecosystem, through patterns of trajectories of microbial evolution, is now possible [3▪]. Therefore, the intestinal microbiota can be analysed nowadays in its ecological complexity of microbial organ within the host organism (superorganism or holobiont), characterized by continuous dynamic interactions with host, food and environment. The exhaustive description of an intestinal microbiota in the early stages of life, immediately after birth and during childhood, when the so-called physiological programming is carried out, has an important impact on neonatology and paediatrics, as it provides nutraceutical indications for the entire process of the growth [4▪▪]. Moreover, it is known that some diseases, expressed at extraintestinal level, such as allergies, are associated with perturbations of the gastrointestinal microbial ecosystem, starting since birth [5▪]. Obesity and metabolic diseases associated with obesity, such as the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, have also been linked to structural and functional characteristics of the intestinal microbiota [6▪], the last also induced by antibiotic treatments, as shown in mouse models [7▪▪]. Based on these studies, it seems plausible that the ability of the intestinal microbiota to regulate the inflammatory response is critical in the complex mechanisms related to obesity and metabolic syndrome, and even to the risk of developing some adult diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases [8▪]. In addition, for mendelian diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic inflammation and hence derived recurrent respiratory infections, appear to have substantial effects on the intestinal microbiota, through dynamic correlations associated with its dysbiosis [9▪]. As it is known, mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene alter the physiology of the ion channel of the apical membranes of epithelial cells, deregulating exocrine production, with consequent malabsorption, obstruction and nutritional deficiency of the intestine. Indeed, in patients with CF the role of the intestinal bacterial proliferation and the implications of the gene defect remain controversial in endogenous inflammation and in the alteration of immunological homeostasis. A recent study produced by our group [10▪▪] has highlighted the main players of the intestinal microbiota that correlate with the gut functional alterations but also with the host's metabolism typical of CF patients. Particularly, 31 CF naïve patients were studied under clinical stability in a case–control modality, hence compared with age-matched healthy patients (1–6 years).

Research currently hypothesizes that gut microbiota alterations are the basis of many chronic inflammatory diseases, allergies, diabetes, obesity. The higher is the diversity, the less likely it is the possibility that external pathogens can invade and settle inside the human body. In fact, if all the niches are occupied, it becomes difficult for the invaders to invade places and become operative. However, the role of the gut microbiota in the human pathogenesis does not rely on exclusive competition: indeed, our microbiome interacts with the environment that dominates the genetic make-up [1▪▪].

Researches on microbiome are increasingly exploiting omic and metaomic pipelines and algorithms that allow microbiomics researchers to characterize the gut and other districts’ human microbiomes in the most variable physiopathological conditions almost reaching the description of the gradient laying between eubiotic and dysbiotic landscapes of gut microbiome. In particular, our research group has focused its activity on the production of microbiome maps (profiles) associated with various pathological conditions such as CF, fatty liver, obesity, multidrug-resistant germ infections, autism, inflammatory bowel diseases, intestinal bowel syndromes, cancer, mental retardation, idiopathic arthritis, allergy, dermatitis, HIV, trying to address dysbiome features through dysbiosis tracking indexes (Patent ITUA20164448: Metagenomic method for in vitro diagnosis of gut dysbiosis) and integrated meta-omics data [16▪–18▪,19▪▪,20▪▪,21▪–24▪,25▪▪,26▪,27▪▪].

In addition, the modulation of the intestinal microbiome following administration of pre, probiotics, nutritional modulation and resetting due to intestinal microbiota transplantation have been investigated. This massive microbiome profiling has generated more than 7000 paediatric and adult microbiota maps, generating a very advanced database of microbiome biobank (https://www.bbmri.it/nodo-nazionale/gruppi-di-lavoro/microbiota-umano-e-biobanking/) and microbiome resources (Fig.
2) that can contribute to the best definitions or taxonomy of the disease. Based on microbiomics algorithms, our group is developing the following decision-support systems (DSS) as diagnostic-clinical tools: first, dysbiosis profiles of intestinal microbiota based on targeted-metagenomics; second, identification of microbial markers and molecular biomarkers of health and disease, directly related to alterations of the intestinal microbiota; third, production of host-microbiome integrated omics data profiles; fourth, faecal microbiota transplant programs; fifth, design of computer applications, based on artificial intelligence to manage omics data and dietary profiles with the purpose to translate microbiota profiling into a score-based system for intestinal dysbiosis diagnosis and clinical-nutraceutical interventions.

The advantages of precision medicine are innumerable. First of all, we can contribute with this approach to clarify unknown etiopathogenetic mechanisms of disease; we can identify several diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in different patients, within the framework of the same pathology, and the reason for their variability; we can understand in different individuals a differential response to the same pharmacological treatment, despite affected by the same disease.

The future of microbiota is already present in current diagnostics and clinical practice and, therefore, it is already precision medicine.
