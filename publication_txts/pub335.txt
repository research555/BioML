Microbiome and Gestational Diabetes: Interactions with Pregnancy Outcome and Long-Term Infant Health

Microbiota composition is progressively being connected to different physiologic effects, such as glucose metabolism, and also to different pathologies, such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). GDM is a public health concern that affects an important percentage of pregnancies and is correlated with many adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. An increasing number of studies are showing some connections between specific microbial composition of the gut microbiota and development of GDM and adverse outcomes in mothers and neonates. The aim of this review is to analyze the available data on microbial changes that characterize healthy pregnancies and pregnancies complicated by GDM and to understand the correlation of these changes with adverse maternal outcomes; this review will also discuss the consequences of these maternal gut microbiome alterations on neonatal microbiota composition and neonatal long-term outcomes.

The human microbiome is the wide community of microorganisms that live in and on the human body. It consists of more than 100 trillion cells [1, 2] and contains 27 times more genes than the human genome [3–5]. The microbiome plays an important role in regulating metabolism, immune function, and behavior in humans [6].

The aim of the present work is to review the role of the microbiome during pregnancy, its physiological modifications among trimesters, and its pathological changes when pregnancy is complicated by gestational diabetes. A brief excursus on the molecular approaches to study the gut microbiome will be presented as well. In addition to this, a review of the mechanisms implicated in the correlation between microbiota alterations, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and neonatal long-term outcome will be performed.

With the term “gut microbiota,” we refer to the microorganisms that colonize the gastrointestinal tract [17]. By now, we know that all these microorganisms, which are more than 100 trillion [18] classified in over 35,000 bacterial species [19], have a symbiotic exchange with the human host through the performance of multiple functions [20]: they are involved in nutrients, xenobiotic and drug metabolisms, antimicrobial protection, immunomodulation, integrity of the gut barrier, and structure of the gastrointestinal tract.

The gut microbiota is composed by several types of microorganisms, including bacteria and viruses. Bacteria are classified in phyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and species [21]. The dominant phyla are Firmicutes and Bacteroides, which represent 90% of the microbiota, followed by Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia [22]. For each phylum, there are predominant genera and species, for example, Firmicutes phyla are represented by Clostridium genera for 95% of its composition but includes also other important genera like Lactobacillus, Bacillus, and Ruminococcus. The composition of the gut microbiota changes between individuals and within the same individual in relation to different factors: gestational age at birth, mode of delivery, age, diet, antibiotics, use of probiotics, body mass index (BMI), and exercise are some of the more studied elements that can influence the human gut microbiota composition. Another factor that can influence the microbiota composition is represented by pregnancy, which is characterized by profound hormonal and metabolic changes [21].

During normal pregnancies, the composition of the gut microbiota changes through the course of gestation: during the first trimester, it resembles that of a healthy nonpregnant individual [9, 23, 24], then it changes gradually, and by the third trimester, it is like the microbiota of people affected by metabolic syndrome, with the capacity to induce it if transplanted in germ-free mice [9]. In particular, the main change is represented by a reduction in alfa-diversity (which is the complexity of species diversity in the sample) and an increase in beta-diversity (which is between-subject diversity) [25]. At the phylum level, there is an increase in Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria and a decline in butyrate-producing bacteria. Butyrate is an important short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) that can serve as a second messenger as well as a source of energy. These changes might be linked with the maternal metabolic profile, consisting of a decline in insulin sensitivity and an increase in nutrient absorption that are necessary to support a healthy pregnancy [26].

Further studies are needed to elucidate the differences between the gut composition of nonpregnant individuals and healthy pregnancies. In consideration of the role played by the gut microbiota in different metabolic processes, research in this field of interest could help understanding the physiology of pregnancy microbiome modifications, and consequently, it could allow developing a strategy of interventions and prevention in high-risk pregnancies.

Until recently, information about the microbes inhabiting the human body was obtained via conventional culture-based microbiology techniques, where fluid or epithelial swabs from a given body site were placed in culture media, and the organisms that grow were phenotypically and genetically characterized [32]. Nowadays, Real-Time-q Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), shotgun sequencing of 16S rRNA/rDNA gene sequence, and fluorescent in situ hybridization coupled with flow cytometry are most widely used to characterize the gut microbiome in human and animal models [15].

Further mechanistic studies, especially in humans, are needed to better understand how gut microbiota interact with the host immune response, especially in the setting of maternal metabolic syndromes, in order to develop targeted interventions during pregnancy and prevent chronic disease in future generations.

Several studies have shown some differences in microbial composition between healthy pregnancy and pregnancy complicated by GDM, even if not all studies are concordant.

Further studies are needed to better understand if the differences in gut microbiota composition continue after the term of pregnancies, playing a role in the development of GDM in subsequent pregnancies and if interventions on its composition in the interpregnancies interval may help prevent the onset of GDM.

Over the course of a normal pregnancy, women undergo several physiological changes, including an increase in insulin resistance (IR). In order to compensate for this physiological resistance, insulin secretion increases gradually during gestation [49]. However, some pregnant women have a limited capacity to increase insulin production and, consequently, develop GDM [50]. Dysbiosis, an altered microbiota composition, has been hypothesized to play a key role in the pathogenesis of many acute and chronic conditions, including metabolic diseases, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [51, 52].

Currently, the etiology is unknown for some of the most important obstetric conditions, such as preeclampsia, premature preterm rupture of membranes, premature labor, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, gestational diabetes, abruptio placentae, late abortions, stillbirth, hyperemesis gravidarum, and gestational trophoblastic disease, although a microbial role has been implicated in all these conditions. In a recent publication, Romero coined the term “The great obstetrical syndromes” [58] referring to syndromes characterized by multiple etiologies, long preclinical stage, frequent fetal involvement, often adaptive clinical manifestations, and predisposing genetic interactions. Diagnosis and treatment for any of these conditions is challenging, although changes in the microbiota were suggested to play a role [59].

There is mounting evidence supporting the role of the gut microbiome in cardiometabolic diseases in pregnancies [60, 61], and the imbalance in the gut microbiome is nowadays considered an important contribution to the development of GDM [61, 62] being already demonstrated that differences in gut microbiome composition, and its related metabolic activities, distinguish lean versus obese individuals and those with type 2 diabetes mellitus versus those without. Moreover, the finding that a different microbial pattern precedes the onset of GDM leads to the hypothesis that microbiota alterations might have a role in the pathogenesis of GDM [9, 39].

More difficult is the topic over the relationship between the composition of the microbiome in pregnancies complicated by GDM and adverse obstetrical outcomes.

Actually, the proof of a link between alteration of the microbiome in pregnancy and adverse obstetrical outcomes is various: a review of the literature [63] and a meta-analysis of 22 studies including 12,047 pregnant women showed that women with periodontitis had an increased risk of preterm delivery (PTD) and of delivering a low-birth-weight infant [64].

A dysbiotic microbiome is implicated in the diffusion of gut bacterial endotoxin into systemic circulation, inducing a low-grade inflammatory response, which is a common feature of cardiometabolic diseases and that in turn raises the risk of maternal complications of pregnancies. Combined with insulin resistance, chronic subclinical inflammation characterizes the hallmark pathway to the development of both gestational diabetes and gestational hypertension [65]. The maternal oral, vaginal, and gut microbiome influence the risk of pregnancy outcomes and have profound impacts upon the health of the neonate and infant, potentially affecting the possibility that patients affected by GDM—given the microbiome imbalance—can be super exposed to preterm birth, preeclampsia, and excessive gestational weight gain.

There is a need for research to further elucidate maternal microbiome patterns that protect against and elevate the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes that impact neonatal and infant health and, thereafter, to identify modifiable factors that influence the composition of the maternal and infant microbiome to support the targeting of health strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes and infant health.

It is well known that the maternal environment affects the offspring health. The newborn gut microbiota is strongly influenced by maternal health and pregnancy conditions and participates in the development programming of the newborns [70–72]. Early disruption of the infant microbiota has been associated with many inflammatory, immune-mediated, allergic, and dysmetabolic diseases in later life [70–73].

GDM was found to be associated with specific changes in the gut microbiota composition [23, 35, 38, 40, 42]. The altered microbiome may have a crucial role in the underlying metabolic dysregulation that underpins the pathogenesis of gestational hyperglycemia, as well as the consequence of the increased adiposity frequently coexisting in GDM patients [74, 75].

A possible vertical mother-to-child transmission of maternal gut bacteria has already been reported, even if, to date, certainty about the way of intrauterine microbial acquisition is lacking [76–78]. Besides breastfeeding and vaginal microbiota, placenta and amniotic fluid have also been reported to be a vehicle for this transmission [9].

Among full-term infants, gut microbiota consists primarily of anaerobic organisms. The “normal” infant gut microbiota develops by the colonization of facultative anaerobic organisms, later developing obligate anaerobes, including Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium [81]. These anaerobes are associated with producing polysaccharides that mediate microbiota colonization, immune modulation, and host-gut cross-talk [70]. For example, Clostridium in the infant's gut, at high levels, is pathogenic and considered unhealthy.

After the age of 3 years, the microbial environment changes rapidly; compositional stability occurs to resemble an adult becoming dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes [82].

Gut microbiota is associated with metabolic and immune-inflammatory axes in the liver, muscle, and brain through host pathways. Dysbiosis, or imbalance of the infant gut microbiome, may be facilitated by early exposure to environmental factors such as bacteria and viruses, which can also alter host microbiota. This dysbiosis of microbiota has long-term effects on host metabolism, leading to metabolic changes, in particular, type 1 diabetes, autoimmune disease, and obesity [70]. In humans, it is suggested that early microbial patterns may predict excessive weight gain in offspring during childhood and later in life [70, 83] and that microbiota-related epigenetic changes during early development can affect phenotypic characteristics such as obesity later in life [83]. All these data support the hypothesis that the infant's early exposure to maternal microbiomes through a transfer of maternal gut microbiota may alter the composition of the infant's gut microbiome.

Recent research reported that GDM alters the microbiota of newborns, contributing to the current understanding of intergenerational obesity and diabetes prevalence [41]. In particular, one study observed a significant reduction in the diversity of various bacterial types in GDM newborns indicating that there might be serious dysbiosis in the gut of GDM newborns [84]. Compared with those of healthy newborns, GDM newborns could be more predisposed to develop gastrointestinal diseases and metabolic syndrome at later stages in their lives [84]. These findings are consistent with previous data showing that the gut microbiota in the GDM group was associated with a lower alpha-diversity level compared with that in the healthy groups [46] which, in turn, is associated with a higher BMI [85]. Research supports that the future health of infants may be affected as the offspring of GDM mothers is more likely to develop obesity during childhood and later in life [79], and this is information that deserves to be included in the prenatal counselling of patients affected by GDM.

Finally, efforts to identify biomarkers that detect neonatal dysbiosis are required to define appropriate diagnostic approaches and design effective early intervention strategies to optimize infancy, childhood, and adult health outcomes.

It is clear from the literature published in this field the crucial role of proper maternal nutrition throughout pregnancy in order to maintain a balanced microbiota colonization, which is demonstrated to positively influence intrauterine and vaginal environment, thus leading to reduced risk of both maternal and neonatal metabolic dysfunction and preterm birth.

Future research should focus on demonstrating the usefulness of “mapping” the maternal microbiome early during pregnancy as a preventive strategy to detect and treat unbalanced microbiota colonization that can be later related to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.

It is clear that the maternal microbiome widely influences neonatal and infant microbiome, and it has been shown that microbiome pathological alterations occurring during pregnancy can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes that negatively affect neonatal and infant long-term health status, with a consistent socioeconomic impact as well.

Further characterization of the maternal microbiome and identification of various factors that facilitate changes in microbial profiles during preconception and in the course of pregnancy may elucidate preconception and prenatal strategies for improving pregnancy outcomes and, thereby, neonatal and infant health.
