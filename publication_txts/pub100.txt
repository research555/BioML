Gut microbiome composition and diversity are related to human personality traits



The gut microbiome has a measurable impact on the brain, influencing stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms and social behaviour. This microbiome–gut–brain axis may be mediated by various mechanisms including neural, immune and endocrine signalling. To date, the majority of research has been conducted in animal models, while the limited number of human studies has focused on psychiatric conditions. Here the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome is investigated with respect to human personality. Using regression models to control for possible confounding factors, the abundances of specific bacterial genera are shown to be significantly predicted by personality traits. Diversity analyses of the gut microbiome reveal that people with larger social networks tend to have a more diverse microbiome, suggesting that social interactions may shape the microbial community of the human gut. In contrast, anxiety and stress are linked to reduced diversity and an altered microbiome composition. Together, these results add a new dimension to our understanding of personality and reveal that the microbiome–gut–brain axis may also be relevant to behavioural variation in the general population as well as to cases of psychiatric disorders.

Personality shapes our world. It influences our health, our friendships, how we deal with stress, what jobs we succeed in and how we like to spend our time. It is approximately 50% heritable in human populations [1], suggesting that environmental factors also contribute significantly to our personality. In addition to our external environment, the burgeoning field of the microbiome is revealing the many ways that our ‘environment within’ can affect our body’s physiology, including our digestion, immunity, metabolism, development and even our behaviour [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. In fact, the number of microbial cells in our bodies is estimated to be roughly equal to our own human cells [7], with the majority of these microorganisms inhabiting the gut. Studies in the past decade provide evidence that the gut microbiome interacts with the central nervous system [8] and such findings have the potential to aid the development of new treatments for conditions such as autism [9] and depression [10]. However, research has largely been conducted in animal models and it is unknown how translatable these findings are to humans [11], [12], [13]. While there is some indication that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may be implicated in neurological and psychiatric disorders [14], an open question remains as to whether variation in the gut microbial community is related to personality, that is behavioural differences between individuals that are consistent over time and different situations and therefore broadly predictable.

The main aim of this research was to determine whether individual variation in the composition and diversity of the human gut microbiome is related to differences in personality. Previous research has focused on animal models or examined broadscale associations between microbiome composition and psychiatric symptoms. In contrast, here targeted regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between personality traits and the abundances of specific bacterial genera identified in the microbiome–gut–brain axis literature (Table 1). It is hypothesized here that genera previously associated with autism may be related to differences in sociability in the general population, while genera previously linked to depression and stress in animalmodels or psychiatric populations may be differentially abundant in the general population with respect to neurotic traits. As well as assessing genus-level composition, the relationship between personality and measures of microbiome diversity was also investigated, with the hypothesis that variables assessing sociability may be positively related to diversity and those assessing neurotic traits may be negatively related.

Adults (over 18 years) were invited to take part in the study (Fig. 1). A faecal sample was received from 671 individuals but sixteen samples were removed (n = 655) since they did not meet the read quality control threshold set at 10,000 reads to ensure detection of low abundance taxa [98]. The research was conducted under a Human Subjects Protocol provided by an institutional review board (Ethical and Independent Review Services, IRB Study #13044-03). All participants provided informed consent and data were analysed anonymously. The sample was 71% female and 29% male, with a mean age of 42 years. Participants resided in twenty different countries and four continents, predominantly North America (83%), with participants from USA accounting for 77% of the sample. 11% of the study participants were from Europe (4% from UK), 5% from Australasia and 2% from Asia.

The microbiome sequencing company uBiome provided participants with their commercially available Gut Kit. Each participant was supplied with one kit to be used for faecal sample collection at home. Analysis of faecal samples is the standard procedure in microbiome research since they are sufficiently representative of the composition of the gut microbiome [99]. The sampling procedure followed the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Human Microbiome Project [100]. The sample collection tube contained a lysis and stabilization buffer for DNA preservation during transport at ambient temperatures [98]. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified using universal primers for the V4 hypervariable region and sequencing was performed on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform, alongside positive and negative controls. Standardized methodology [98] for sample processing and sequencing was conducted by uBiome and has been shown to generate reproducible microbiome profiles [101].

An online questionnaire designed for this study was distributed to participants. In total, 44 study variables (continuous and categorical) were analysed relating to behavioural traits, diet, health and lifestyle and also sociodemographics. While the majority of variables were assessed through binary questions or point scales, personality and social behaviour were evaluated with widely used and validated questionnaires from psychological research. The 50-item International Personality Item Pool [102] was used to assess personality traits according to the five-factor model of personality. A large number of studies find that individual differences in human behaviour can broadly be divided into five key domains, known as the ‘Big Five’ [103], [104], comprising extraversion (propensity to seek and enjoy others’ company), agreeableness (trust and cooperation in social interactions), conscientiousness (attention to detail and focus), neuroticism (tendency to feel negative emotions) and openness (creativity, intellectual curiosity and willingness to seek new experiences). These traits are temporally stable within individuals [105] and are found in both sexes, all races and across cultures [106]. In addition, the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory [107], specifically the trait subscale, was used to determine the participants’ general tendency to feel anxious. Participants were also scored for two subscales (social skill and communication) from the Autism Spectrum Quotient, which measures the degree to which any neurotypical adultlies on the continuum between normality and autistic-like behaviours [108]. Social network size was evaluated based on the number of people in their two innermost layers, approximately corresponding to those individuals contacted on a weekly and monthly basis respectively [109].

Detailed dietary habits of the participants were assessed with the EPIC-Norfolk Food Frequency Questionnaire [110]. The associated software, Food Frequency Questionnaire EPIC Tool for Analysis [111], was used to estimate total calorie consumption and intake of food groups, macronutrients, minerals and vitamins (56 variables in total). Food frequency questionnaires with more than ten missing entries were excluded in accordance with the guidelines.

Microbiome count data are often overdispersed, with a high proportion of zeros [112], [113] and heavily right-skewed [114]. This is because there are relatively few taxa that are shared by the majority of samples, since most taxa are rare and only detected in a small proportion of samples [112]. Given this overdispersion, count data cannot be normalized via transformation and so negative binomial regression was conducted with genus abundance as the response variable (or zero-inflated negative binomial regression in cases where the count data contained an excess of zeros). When modelling microbiome data, it is necessary to account for variation in sequencing read depth between samples. However, rarefying count data or transforming it into proportions can lead to a high rate of false positives and is not recommended for analyses of taxon abundance [115]. Instead, the logarithm of the total read number was included as an offset in the regression models, thereby preserving statistical power by retaining all the count data [112], [116].

Negative binomial regression analyses were conducted using the R package VGAM to model microbiome count data. All statistical analyses in this study were performed using R 3.2.3 software [135]. An extensive literature review was carried out to identify putative taxa that have been associated with behavioural or psychiatric traits in animal research or human populations. Genera that showed a significant association in at least two independent studies (Table 1) were then targeted in the regression analyses. Genus-level count data were used for the regression models since 16S rRNA sequencing provides an estimated 96% accuracy for genus identification [136] but has limited phylogenetic resolution at the species level [137].

Analyses were also conducted to determine how the overall compositional profile of the microbiome, measured with alpha and beta diversity metrics, was related to the study variables. Alpha diversity is the ecological diversity of a single sample, taking into account the number of different taxa and their relative abundances, while beta diversity measures differences in microbial community composition between individuals [138]. The R package phyloseq was used to determine richness and alpha diversity at the genus level [139]. Since the choice of diversity index can significantly influence results [140], both Shannon’s diversity index and the inverse Simpson’s diversity index were calculated (the inverse of Simpson’s index being more intuitive since its value increases as diversity increases). While these two diversity indices take into account both richness and evenness, Shannon’s diversity index is more sensitive to changes in abundance of rare taxa, whereas the inverse Simpson’s diversity index gives more weight to common taxa [141].

To assess beta diversity, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was conducted to determine which variables significantly affect the overall composition of the gut microbiome. Distance matrices were computed using the distance function in the R package phyloseq [139] to assess the pairwise similarity of gut microbiome composition between individuals. The Bray–Curtis index provides a quantitative measure of dissimilarity between microbial communities, while the Jaccard index is qualitative since it only takes into account presence versus absence of taxa and not their abundances [116]. PERMANOVA was carried out on both Bray–Curtis and Jaccard distance matrices using the adonis function from the R package vegan with 1000 permutations. This function estimates the variance in the distance matrix that is attributable to the variable of interest, that is, the extent to which each variable may explain differences between individuals in microbial community composition. The P values from these analyses were then adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg method to control for the false discovery rate (FDR), with Padj < 0.1 considered statistically significant.

Gut microbiome composition differed markedly between individuals (Fig. 2), as has repeatedly been shown in human populations [142]. Out of all the genera detected across the gut microbiome samples, the top twenty most abundant genera showed close correspondence with previous research [143]. Bacteroides was the most abundant genus, as found in other studies [144], [145]. There was also considerable variation among the study population in the variables assessed in the questionnaire (Tables S1 and S2). The majority of study variables from the questionnaire showed little to modest intercorrelation (Fig. S1), though as expected there was a high degree of correlation between the nutrient variables assessed in the food frequency questionnaire (Fig. S2).

Negative binomial regression analyses revealed that the abundances for seven of the 23 genera were significantly predicted by individual variation in behavioural traits (Fig. 3; Table S3). Sociability (a combined measure of the participant’s extraversion, social skill and communication) was a positive predictor of genus abundance for Akkermansia (P = 0.038), Lactococcus (P = 0.002) and Oscillospira (P < 0.001), and a negative predictor of the abundances of Desulfovibrio (P = 0.019) and Sutterella (P = 0.028). The variable assessing neurotic tendencies (a combined measure of neuroticism, anxiety and stress) negatively predicted genus abundance for Corynebacterium (P < 0.001) and Streptococcus (P = 0.029). Table 2 compares these bacterial genera found to be significantly related to behavioural traits with the results of previous studies on these genera.

There were also notable results in terms of the possible confounding factors included in the models. Age and body mass index were common predictors of abundance, significantly predicting the abundances of eight and seven genera, respectively. In contrast, birth delivery mode and infant feeding method had little influence on the abundances of most genera. Delivery mode was only a significant predictor of the abundance of one genus, Flavonifractor, with a higher abundance in individuals born by caesarean section. Formula feeding during infancy was a positive predictor of Lactobacillus abundance, in agreement with previous research findings [146]. Surprisingly, abundances of only three of the 23 genera were significantly altered by antibiotic treatment in the past six months, indicative of the differential effects antibiotics can have on bacterial taxa. Three genera, Lactobacillus, Prevotella and Streptococcus, were more abundant in females, which is consistent with previous findings for Lactobacillus [120], [147].

Overall, 25 of the 44 study variables were significantly related to gut microbiome diversity (Padj < 0.1), as measured by Shannon’s diversity index, with the majority of these (22 variables) also retaining significance at FDR < 0.05 (Fig. 4; Table S4). For the primary variables of interest relating to behaviour, both stress (Padj = 0.045) and anxiety (Padj = 0.077) were negatively correlated with Shannon’s diversity index, and agreeableness was also negatively related (Padj = 0.048). There was a positive correlation between Shannon’s diversity index and social network size (Padj = 0.043), such that individuals with a larger social network tended to have a more diverse gut microbiome.

With respect to nutrient intake estimated from the food frequency questionnaire, the consumption of fruit and cereals, and therefore fibre (and more generally carbohydrates), was positively related to diversity (Table S5). This was in accordance with previous findings that the metabolism of carbohydrates, particularly fibre, promotes microbial diversity [148], [149], [150]. Diversity was also significantly correlated with the dietary abundance of a range of minerals and vitamins (Table S5). There was little relationship between genus richness and nutrient intake with the exception of fish consumption which was positively related.

Differences in the composition of the gut microbiome, as quantified by the Bray–Curtis index, were significantly related to 28 of the 44 variables (Padj < 0.1), with most of these (22 variables) retaining significance at FDR < 0.05 (Fig. 5; Table S6). While the P values reported below refer to results with the Bray–Curtis index, the same variables were also significant when using the Jaccard index to measure differences in microbial community composition (Table S6).

All the main dietary variables were significantly related to composition (Fig. 5). Both gluten-free and dairy-free diets were associated with an altered microbial community, in accordance with other research findings [152], [153], [154]. The consumption of naturally occurring prebiotic fibre showed the strongest relationship with gut microbiome composition. In terms of the results of the food frequency questionnaire, consumption of fruit, vegetables and cereals, and therefore the total intake of carbohydrates including fibre, were all significantly related to microbiome composition, as well as certain minerals and vitamins (Table S7).

Investigations of the microbiome–gut–brain axis have predominantly been conducted in animal models or clinical populations, with few studies exploring whether these findings are translatable to the general population. Here both gut microbiome composition and diversity were found to be related to differences in personality. This is the first time that abundances of microbial genera have been modelled with respect to human personality, while also rigorously controlling for the possible confounding effects of key variables known to influence the gut microbiome. The regression results revealed that abundances of particular genera are significantly related to behavioural traits, suggesting that studying the gut microbiome may be relevant to understanding variation in human personality. People with larger social networks were also found to have more diverse microbial communities,indicating that social behaviour may promote diversity of the human gut microbiome. By contrast, lower diversity was associated with increased levels of stress and anxiety, and these traits were also related to differences in overall composition of the microbial community. In addition, the intercorrelation analysis (Fig. S1) revealed that people who ate more foods with naturally occurring probiotics or prebiotics had significantly lower levels of anxiety, stress and neuroticism and were also less likely to suffer from a mental illness, but this relationship was not found in those consuming probiotics or prebiotics in supplement form. Consistent with this, a previous study reported that females consuming more fermented foods (a source of natural probiotics) had fewer symptoms of social anxiety [155] and similarly a traditional Japanese diet rich in fermented soy products has been linked to reduced depressive symptoms [156].

In conclusion, differences in gut microbiome composition and diversity are shown to be linked to personality traits in the general population. The results of this study add a new dimension to our understanding of personality and are in line with accumulating evidence that the gut microbiome can influence the central nervous system in humans, with effects on behaviour. Such findings may inform the development of probiotic or prebiotic therapies to help improve mood and treat conditions such as autism, anxiety and depression. Discovering new and effective interventions for mental health conditions is of pressing concern, given the declines in psychological health of our modern society. Finally, it is pertinent to reflect on the ways in which our modern-day living may provide a perfect storm for dysbiosis of the gut. We lead stressful lives with fewer social interactions and less time spent with nature, our diets are typically deficient in fibre, we inhabit oversanitized environments and are dependent on antibiotic treatments. All these factors can influence the gut microbiome and so may be affecting our behaviour and psychological well-being in currently unknown ways.
