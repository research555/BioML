Gastrointestinal microbiota composition predicts peripheral inflammatory state during treatment of human tuberculosis

The composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota influences systemic immune responses, but how this affects infectious disease pathogenesis and antibiotic therapy outcome is poorly understood. This question is rarely examined in humans due to the difficulty in dissociating the immunologic effects of antibiotic-induced pathogen clearance and microbiome alteration. Here, we analyze data from two longitudinal studies of tuberculosis (TB) therapy (35 and 20 individuals) and a cross sectional study from 55 healthy controls, in which we collected fecal samples (for microbiome analysis), sputum (for determination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacterial load), and peripheral blood (for transcriptomic analysis). We decouple microbiome effects from pathogen sterilization by comparing standard TB therapy with an experimental TB treatment that did not reduce Mtb bacterial load. Random forest regression to the microbiome-transcriptome-sputum data from the two longitudinal datasets reveals that renormalization of the TB inflammatory state is associated with Mtb pathogen clearance, increased abundance of Clusters IV and XIVa Clostridia, and decreased abundance of Bacilli and Proteobacteria. We find similar associations when applying machine learning to peripheral gene expression and microbiota profiling in the independent cohort of healthy individuals. Our findings indicate that antibiotic-induced reduction in pathogen burden and changes in the microbiome are independently associated with treatment-induced changes of the inflammatory response of active TB, and the response to antibiotic therapy may be a combined effect of pathogen killing and microbiome driven immunomodulation.

There is mounting evidence that the gut microbiome has an important role in the modulation of host physiology, with a wealth of studies having associated microbiome composition and functions with differential inflammatory, neurological, and even behavioral activity1. Gastrointestinal colonization by specific taxa with particular metabolic capacities has been shown to differentially modulate host biology2. For example, colonization by a subset of Clostridia enhanced anti-inflammatory phenotypes in mice3, and enrichment in specific members of the Bacteroides and Parabacteroides genera induced CD8+ T cell responses and anticancer activity in mice and marmosets4, as well as correlating with the abundance of these immune effectors in humans5. A multitude of experiments in mice have allowed for the determination of mechanisms by which gastrointestinal mucosal-associated bacteria affect host physiology at the epithelial interface and systemically throughout their host6,7.

To address these questions, we combined three independent clinical datasets for which we had gathered microbiome profiling via 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing, peripheral blood transcriptomics, and Mtb abundance in the sputum (in 2 of 3 datasets). The first dataset (Fig. 1A, B) consists of the secondary endpoint data from a longitudinal and interventional clinical trial (NCT02684240) that compared the early bactericidal effect (EBA) of standard tuberculosis (TB) therapy isoniazid (H), rifampin (R), pyrazinamide (Z), and ethambutol (E) (HRZE, arm 1) to the antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide (NTZ, arm 2), shown to possess antimycobacterial activity in vitro25,26. The analyzed data included the 29 subjects in the trial, whose primary endpoint results along with randomization procedures, statistical plan, and other details, were recently reported in Walsh et al.26, and six additional individuals that gave informed consent for the pilot pre-randomization phase of the study, which was run to verify assays and collection protocols (leading to a total N = 35 for Cohort 1). We note that compared to Walsh et al.26 in where 20 people received NTZ we were able to collect stool and blood specimen for only 19 of them to be used in this study. The second dataset (Cohort 2, N = 20 at baseline) consisted of an independent 6-month longitudinal and observational HRZE treatment cohort (Fig. 1A, B). We used these two Cohorts to first characterize short (for both HRZE and NTZ treatments) and long-term (for HRZE only) effects on the gastrointestinal microbiota and peripheral gene expression. More importantly we used these two cohorts’ data to answer our underlying questions by training Random Forest Regression models to assess the changes in expression of peripheral inflammatory pathways as a function of changes in microbiota species abundances and simultaneous changes in Mtb in the sputum (Fig. 1C). Finally, we validated the determined microbiota-peripheral-gene expression relationships using a cross-sectional and observational cohort of healthy Haitian community controls (CC) and healthy household contacts (or Family Contacts, FC) of TB patients (for a total N = 55), some previously described5 (Fig. 1A, B).

As detailed elsewhere, the GHESKIO centers in Port au Prince, Haiti conducted a prospective, randomized, early bactericidal activity (EBA) study in treatment-naive, drug-susceptible adult patients with uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02684240)26. 30 participants were randomized to receive either NTZ, 1000 mg po (oral) twice daily, or standard oral therapy with isoniazid 300 mg daily, rifampin 600 mg daily, pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg daily, and ethambutol 15 mg/kg daily (referred to as HRZE) for 14 days (Figs. 1A,
2A), and 5 participants were prescreened to receive HRZE. These five additional individuals had given informed consent for the pilot pre-randomization phase of the study (see above) The primary endpoint of the trial was sputum bacterial load (measured by time to culture positivity, TTP) in a BACTEC liquid culture system, as a quantitative microbiologic measure of disease resolution. Sputum was collected from 6 p.m. to 9 a.m. every other day to quantify mycobactericidal activity of each treatment regimen.

To compare the effect of the two treatments to microbiome alpha diversity we calculated the Inverse Simpson Diversity Index for every microbiome sample28. We then regressed the Inverse Simpson Diversity Index via linear mixed-effect modeling as
Diversity~Sex+Age+Batch+Treatment+Time
+Treatment:Time+1∣ID
(see “Methods” section). We found that there were no differences in alpha diversity at baseline between the two arms, while both treatments significantly reduced microbial diversity (p < 0.01, see Supplementary Data 3), with NTZ treatment not having a significantly different effect compared to HRZE (p > 0.05, for the interaction term, See Supplementary Data 3) (Fig. 1D).

To identify phylotypes significantly affected by each of the two treatments, we modeled the abundance of each sequencing variant identified via dada2 (ASV) via linear mixed-effect modeling as
ASV
i
(counts)~Sex+Batch+Group+1∣ID
using Limma/Voom29 (see “Methods”section). This model statement enables quantifying sex and sequencing batch-dependent effects in addition to establishing effects that are due to treatment group (pre-treatment, HRZE, NTZ). We used the 1|ID random effect to control for baseline differences among individuals. ASVs significantly affected by the treatments were determined using a Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value of 0.05 (see “Methods” section).

Taken together, these results demonstrate that NTZ, despite having no effect on Mtb bacterial load, causes a perturbation of the gastrointestinal microbiota which is more pronounced compared to that caused by HRZE. This includes the depletion of a large number of Clostridia, and the selection for known disease-associated, oxygen-tolerant pathobionts.

As the above results highlighted a differential effect on TB disease resolution and gastrointestinal microbiota composition of the two antimicrobials tested, we recognized that this presented a unique opportunity to infer possible relationship between microbiome composition, Mtb bacterial load, and peripheral gene expression. As the patients were randomized at baseline before being assigned to the two treatments, we used linear mixed-effect modeling with Limma/Voom to model the abundance of each host transcript as
Gen
e
i
(Counts)~Sex+Batch+Group+1∣ID
(See “Methods” section).

Because NTZ perturbs the microbiome without affecting Mtb disease resolution, we hypothesized that there may be other subsets of host transcripts that are linked to microbiome-dependent immunity that could be responsive to the observed microbiome perturbations. To test this, considering the already well-established link between microbiome dysbiosis and autoinflammatory conditions such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)42, we selected a recently published panel of 880 genes differentially expressed in colon biopsies from IBD patients compared to asymptomatic controls41. Of these 880 genes, 364 were detected in our dataset (expected given that we are profiling whole blood transcriptomics, rather than colon tissue). We defined renormalization as those genes that have a post/pre fold change due to antimicrobial treatment of the same sign as control/active IBD. Despite the more limited effect on the microbiome compared to NTZ, HRZE administration was found to be responsible for a change in 117 of these genes (FDR < 0.05) (Fig. 4D, Supplementary Data 9), while NTZ was found to be responsible for a change in 55 of them (FDR < 0.05) (Fig. 4E, Supplementary Data 10). These data suggest that there may be microbiome related changes in the peripheral inflammatory state that are induced by HRZE and NTZ.

To validate the observations obtained after two weeks of HRZE and to identify effects that may occur with increased treatment length, we enrolled a longitudinal treatment cohort (20 individuals) to measure disease resolution over the course of the 6 months of HRZE treatment, with periodic sampling of sputum for TTP, stool for microbiome profiling, and peripheral blood for RNA sequencing (Fig. 5A). All participants received standard of care HRZE therapy (isoniazid 300 mg daily, rifampin 600 mg daily, pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg daily, and ethambutol 15 mg/kg daily). Sputum mycobacterial load (TTP) was collected at baseline, day 7, day 14, 1 month, 2 months, and 6 months at the completion of treatment. Stool from microbiome profiling was collected at each of these timepoints as well. Whole blood was collected at baseline, day 14, and 2 months. Stool and peripheral blood samples were processed for microbiome and transcriptomic profiling as for the clinical trial described above (See “Methods” section).

With respect to the peripheral host inflammatory profiling, we observed distinct changes in gene signatures at two weeks (day 14) and two months of treatment, compared to baseline (see Supplementary Data 14). We observed a similar decrease in common inflammatory pathways in the Hallmark pathway dataset described in the HRZE/NTZ trial (Fig. 5E, see Supplementary Data 15). Interestingly, comparing Day 56 to baseline or to Day 14, we see additional reduction in inflammatory gene signatures, potentially explained in part by the further increase in TTP (reduction of bacterial load) at Day 56 (Fig. 5F–K, see Supplementary Data 16, 17).

We next sought to determine the relative contribution of gastrointestinal microbiota and Mtb dynamics in predicting the changing dynamics of peripheral inflammatory gene signature. As a granular reflection of the TB inflammatory disease state, we reasoned that the resolution of this state would likely be influenced by the combined upstream factors of pathogen killing and microbiome perturbation. We hypothesized that modeling these relationships could be achieved by both leveraging individual variability in response to HRZE treatments, as well as by leveraging the data from the NTZ arm of the HRZE/NTZ trial. This is because the NTZ arm is effectively a “natural” experimental control as it provides for examples in where we observe both gastrointestinal microbiota and gene-expression changes in the absence of changes in Mtb. Specifically, our aim was to identify microbiota members for which changes in abundance associates with significant changes in inflammatory pathways in the three groups of antibiotic-treated individuals. To do this, for each inflammatory hallmark pathway identified to be significantly affected by HRZE or NTZ via linear mixed effects modeling, we first computed the change in normalized enrichment score between two consecutive time points

. Using change from baseline values accounts for the random effect of each subject without having to incorporate this into the model statement. We solved this regression problem using Random Forest regression as in ref. 44. To train the models, we used all the observations from the HRZE/NTZ trial and from the longitudinal observational cohort for a total of 34 paired samples (Fig. 1). We fit a model for each inflammatory pathway using all the data from the two longitudinal cohorts (HRZE/NTZ trial, and HRZE longitudinal observational cohort) because we wanted to find patterns that are general across multiple datasets. Each model was trained using 5000 trees and with a train-validation partitioning of 80–20% of the data. We reasoned that this approach was appropriately suited for this type of “large p, small n” multi-omics dataset common in clinical research45. Importantly RFR modeling has significant advantages compared to traditional multi-linear regression techniques, because it is agnostic to model structure (e.g., non-parametric regression), it does not need to meet common assumptions underlying classical regression techniques, and is able to intrinsically perform ranked feature selection. Importantly, while the interpretation of RFR is apparently less immediate compared to traditional regression (e.g., there are per-se no regression coefficients or betas), downstream analysis, which includes Permutated Importance46 and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) calculations47 (see “Methods” section) allows for the estimation of the significance of predictors (e.g., TTP, microbiome constituents, etc.) and of their effects on the dependent variable (e.g., host peripheral inflammatory markers).

Based on this modeling, we hypothesize that successful disease resolution may be associated with preservation of Clostridia, whereas their depletion and consequent enhancement of dysbiosis-associated Enterobacteriaceae or Bacilli pathobionts might slow resolution or even support inflammatory exacerbation54.

The results from our machine learning modeling on the data from both longitudinal treatment cohorts provide support to the hypothesis that specific gastrointestinal microbiota members are associated with immune-related peripheral blood gene signatures in humans. Specifically, higher abundance of Clostridia is negatively associated with inflammation (e.g., INFα, INFγ, IL6/JAK/STAT3, Inflammatory Response gene signatures), while higher abundance of common oxygen-tolerant pathobionts is associated with exacerbation of these signatures. To assess the generality of these findings we hypothesized that, even in healthy individuals, different levels of colonization by these bacteria would associated with different levels of immune-related peripheral blood gene signatures.

We performed RFR (see “Methods” section) for each pathway against the microbiome space, and summarized the findings in Fig. 7B. Surprisingly, we found the abundance of a large number of Firmicutes and particularly Clostridia to be associated with a number of the characterized Hallmark molecular pathways (see Supplementary Data 21). Even more intriguingly we found that higher abundance of ASVs that are mapped to health-associated Clostridia including F. prausnitzii, Rumonoccocus spp., and C. catus, are associated with a reduction in proinflammatory pathways including INFα, and INFγ. This independent analysis in homeostatic conditions is consistent with the findings obtained from the application of our modeling analysis on the HRZE/NTZ clinical trial and on the longitudinal, observational HRZE treatment cohort (Fig. 6). These results, performed in a cohort of 55 volunteers from the Haitian community, thus reinforces the hypothesis that the relative abundance of specific gastrointestinal microbiota members, which we find to be perturbed by TB therapy, correlates with inflammatory peripheral gene expression in humans.

Since the advent of high-throughput microbiome characterization, it has become clear that antibiotics are one of the most common and severe perturbing influences on human microbiome composition, with both acute and longer lasting effects56,57. It also has become evident that the specific microbiome constituents have specific effects on host immunity, including influencing the abundance and function of immune cell subsets24. Significant prior data have documented the effects of antibiotics on microbiome composition and function and the consequent influence of these microbiome factors on immune cell populations58, with the majority of these findings derived using in vivo mouse models. While there is no doubt that microbiota dynamics affect host immunity6, it remains unknown to what degree antibiotic induced perturbation of the microbiome may modify the outcome of treatment of infection, or what relationships exist in humans between gut microbiota composition and peripheral gene expression. It is conceivable that antibiotics work to clear infection both due to direct pathogen killing and by immune modulation through the microbiome. It is also possible that the pathogen killing effect of antibiotics may be partially counteracted by detrimental immune effects induced by microbiome perturbation. Such dynamics may be particularly relevant to the treatment of chronic infections such at tuberculosis, in which antibiotic therapy is prolonged and the disease manifestations reflect a mixture of pathogen burden and the balance of inflammatory mediators that cause tissue destruction and chronic symptomatology59,60.

Despite the above caveats, our data indicates that within the first 14 days of treatment of TB, resolution of the active inflammatory response of TB (as measured by peripheral blood transcriptomics) may be affected both by reducing Mtb burden, as well as through antimicrobial-induced microbiome perturbations that may act directly on systemic immune function. Among the pathways tightly correlated with both factors are the signature activated pathways of active TB disease: IFNγ, type I interferon, and TNFα14. There is growing evidence that the outcome of active TB reflects a mixture of pathogen burden and cytokine networks that include IL-1 and IFNγ, with the latter acting to exacerbate disease59. Our findings indicate that the microbiome perturbation that accompanies TB treatment is a predictor of the normalization of these same pathways during early treatment, suggesting that microbiome perturbation could modify or predict the rapidity of disease resolution. In the first two weeks of treatment, pathogen killing is the dominant factor, but microbiome-dependent modulation of inflammatory responses during treatment may assume an important role during the later phases of treatment when pathogen killing slows. The validation of the relationships between microbiome composition and peripheral gene expression in a healthy control cohort, especially for the collective expression of these same pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways, suggests that these relationships may extend into other populations. Whether these relationships are causal, or biomarkers of another state, will remain at the forefront of future study design. Future work will be directed to applying the analytical tools and study design presented here to later time points in the TB treatment course to examine whether microbiome perturbation during treatment associates with clinically relevant treatment outcomes, and whether the abundance of Clostridia correlates with rapidity of Mtb sterilization or the resolution of the inflammatory response that accompanies active TB. Such data might help support trials to test microbiome monitoring as a predictor of TB treatment outcome or help understand interindividual heterogeneity in treatment outcomes.

All volunteers provided written informed consent to participate in this study. All human studies were reviewed and approved by the IRBs of both Weill Cornell Medicine and Groupe Haitien d’etude du Sarcome de Kaposi et des Infections Opportunistes (GHESKIO) Centers (Port-au-Prince, Haiti). Participants provided informed consent prior to peripheral blood draw for whole blood collection and stool collection for 16S rDNA sequencing. All methods and procedures were performed in accordance with the relevant institutional guidelines and regulations. Supplementary Data 1 provides a table with first-last day of enrollment for each Cohort.

All randomization procedures, statistical plan including power calculation and all other details of the NCT02684240 trial are reported in Walsh et al.26. All the details about pre-randomization enrollment into HRZE to test the methods for the six additional individuals that gave informed consent for the pilot pre-randomization phase of the study are also reported in Walsh et al.26. Importantly we could not collect stool and blood specimen from one individual from the NTZ arm of the trial and hence only 19 of the 20 NTZ-treated individuals were include in this study’s analysis.

The protocol for estimation of Mtb load from the sputum has been reported in in Walsh et al.26. Briefly, Mtb was quantified by the number of hours to positive signal using a Bactec 960 automated liquid culture system (Becton and Dickenson [BD], Franklin Lakes, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This approach has been validated and shown to be comparable to determination of CFU counts67. The minimum amount of overnight sputum sample required for Mtb quantification was 5 ml, and all overnight sputum samples collected exceeded that amount. Sputum samples were decontaminated via a 20-min incubation, with vortexing, with 5 ml of NALC–NaOH (3% sodium hydroxide, 0.5 to 0.6% N-acetyl-l-cysteine, 1.47% sodium citrate). The endpoint was positive fluorescent signal indicating microbial growth. The reported TTP is the average of the two individual liquid cultures (e.g., technical replicates).

Donors were enrolled through the Clinical Trials Unit at GHESKIO. Pulmonary TB was diagnosed by clinical symptoms, chest radiograph consistent with pulmonary TB, and positive molecular testing. No other formal enrollment criteria were required, like prior antibiotic treatment. All participant samples were deidentified on site using a barcode system before they were shipped to Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM)/Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) for analysis. All clinical metadata was collected on site and managed through the REDCap data management system.68

We recruited families of active pulmonary TB patients where at least two siblings within the family were diagnosed with active TB. These criteria were designed to select for households with high risk of transmission of Mtb. Household contacts were then recruited if they had been sleeping in the same house with a TB case for at least one month during the six months prior to the TB case diagnosis. Contacts underwent clinical screening for active TB symptoms and IGRA testing. Healthy donors without history of TB contacts or disease were recruited from the same community as a control group for exposure and also underwent clinical screening for active TB symptoms and IGRA testing. All donors provided informed consent prior to peripheral blood donation for whole blood collection for RNAseq and stool submission for DNA extraction and 16S rDNA sequencing.

DNA extraction from stool was performed as described.22 Stool specimens were collected and stored for less than 24 h at 4 °C, aliquoted (~2 ml each), frozen at –80 °C, and shipped to WCM/MSKCC. About 200–500 mg of stool from frozen samples was suspended in 500 μl of extraction buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl [Thermo Fisher Scientific], pH 8.0; 200 mM NaCl [Thermo Fisher Scientific]; 20 mM EDTA [MilliporeSigma]), 210 μl of 20% SDS, 500 μl of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1; MilliporeSigma), and 500 μl of 0.1-mm–diameter zirconia/silica beads (Biospec Products). Samples were lysed via mechanical disruption with a bead beater (Biospec Products for 2 min, followed by 2 extractions with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol [25:24:1]). DNA was precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate at –80 °C for at least 1 h, resuspended in 200 μl of nuclease-free water, and further purified with QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. DNA was eluted in 200 μl of nuclease-free water and stored at –20 °C.

Primers used to amplify rDNA were: 563F (59-nnnnnnnn-NNNNNNNNNNNN-AYTGGGYDTAAAGN G-39) and 926R (59-nnnnnnnn-NNNNNNNNNNNN-CCGTCAATTYHTTTR AGT-39). Each reaction contained 50 ng of purified DNA, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.5 μM MgCl2, 1.25 U Platinum TaqDNA polymerase, 2.5 μl of 10× PCR buffer, and 0.2 μM of each primer. A unique 12-base Golay barcode (Ns) preceded the primers for sample identification after pooling amplicons. One to 8 additional nucleotides were added before the barcode to offset the sequencing of the primers. Cycling conditions were the following: 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 27 cycles of 94 °C for 50 s, 51 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, where the final elongation step was performed at 72 °C for 5 min. Replicate PCRs were combined and were subsequently purified using the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and Qiagen MinElute PCR Purification Kit. PCR products were quantified and pooled at equimolar amounts before Illumina barcodes and adapters were ligated on using the Illumina TruSeq Sample Preparation procedure. The completed library was sequenced on an Illumina Miseq platform per the Illumina recommended protocol.

Forward and reverse 16S MiSeq-generated amplicon sequencing reads were dereplicated and sequences were inferred using dada2.69 Potentially chimeric sequences were removed using consensus-based methods. Taxonomic assignments were made using BLASTN against the NCBI refseq_rna database. These files were imported into R and merged with a metadata file into a single Phyloseq object.

Collection of peripheral blood and evaluation of host gene expression follows our previous published work70. Briefly, peripheral blood was collected into Tempus™ Blood RNA tubes (Applied Biosystems) for the HRZE/NTZ trial cohort, as well as the control cohort. RNA was extracted using the Tempus™ Spin RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion), with addition of on-column DNase treatment (AbsoluteRNA, Ambion). For the EBA longtidunal cohort, PAXgene tubes were used to collect blood according to the manufacturers protocol. RNA was ribo-depleted by polyA selection and libraries were generated using TruSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Paired-end RNA sequences (50 × 50PE) were generated with HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) with at least 50 million reads per sample. Sequence integrity was verified using FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics). Sequences were aligned to the human genome (version hg38) using STAR aligner71 and transcript counts were estimated using featurecounts72. Quality of aligned and counted reads was assessed using Quality of RNA-Seq ToolSet (QoRTs)73.

All statistical and computational analysis was performed in R v.3.6.1 (2019-07-05) with Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit), running under: Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS.

For the clinical trial, to identify the significance of the influence of sex, age, treatment groups (HRZE and NTZ), and time of treatment on time to positivity (TTP), we implemented a linear mixed effect model as
TTP~Sex+Age+Time*Treatment+1∣ID
. Similarly, to associate the significance of the effect of sex, age, treatment groups (HRZE and NTZ), sequencing batches, and time of treatment on microbiota diversity (Inverse Simpson), Inverse Simpson was modeled as
Diversity~Sex+Age+Batch+Time*Treatment+1
∣ID

To determine how the anti-TB treatment affects both microbiome and peripheral gene expression profiles we performed differential analysis on the counts data obtained by microbiome DNA and peripheral blood RNA sequencing. As the primary endpoint of the clinical trial was powered to determine differences in Mtb load (TTP), we determined the statistical power available to identify significant differences in the abundance of both microbiota ASVs, and in the expression of peripheral genes. We ran power calculations to determine that with 16 pre and 16 post treatment microbiome samples and 8 pre treatment and 8 post treatment RNAseq samples for the HRZE cohort, with 80% power at a significance level (α) of 0.05, we could detect a fold change of 1.4 for microbiome difference and a fold change of 1.8 for mRNA transcripts. In the NTZ cohort, with 18 pre treatment and 18 post treatment microbiome samples and 14 pre and 14 post treatment RNAseq samples, with 80% power at α < 0.05, we can detect a fold change of 1.4 for microbiome differences and a fold change of 1.6 for mRNA transcripts. In the longitudinal cohort with 20 baseline, 10 day 7, 18 day 14, 13 one month, 13 two month, and 11 six month follow up microbiome samples, with 80% power at a significance level (α) of 0.05, we can detect a fold change of 1.4 (day 7), 1.36 (day 14), 1.4 (1, 2, and 6 months). In the six-month longitudinal and observational treatment cohort with 19 baseline, 19 day 14, and 13 two-month RNAseq samples, with 80% power at a significance level (α) of 0.05, we can detect a fold change of 1.4 for mRNA transcripts at day 14, and 1.5 at two months. Power calculations were performed with the RNAseqPower package in R. For microbiome data we calculated a biological coefficient of variation of 0.3, and for RNAseq, we used a coefficient of variation of 0.4. We estimated the expected minimum fold change that we could observe for each group based on the sample size, sequencing depth, and an α of 0.05. To visualize trends of transcript fold changes, we used scatter plots and calculated post-vs-pre fold changes for all transcripts throughout.

We assessed the relative contribution of the gastrointestinal microbiota and Mtb dynamics towards peripheral gene expressions using Random forest regression (RFR). Instead of modeling each gene/transcript profile as a function of microbiome and TTP, we mapped our gene expression data to a set of 50 Hallmark Pathways via GSVA. To avoid having correlated samples from same individual in a model, we instead modeled the changes in normalized enrichment score of Hallmark pathways at two time points (Day 0 and Day 14) as a function of change in microbiome and TTP at corresponding timepoints. For each Hallmark pathwaylidentified to be significantly affected by HRZE (HRZE/NTZ trial or six-month longitudinal and observational treatment cohort) or NTZ via linear mixed effects modeling, we first computed the change in normalized enrichment score ΔNESl between two consecutive time points Day 0 and Day 14 as ΔNESl = NESl14 – NESl0 for each individual. We then regressed this quantity against the corresponding Log2 fold change of normalized counts value (NEV) of every ASV v as Log2(NEVv14/NEVv0) in the same interval and against the log2 fold change in TTP i.e., Log2 (TTP14/TTP0). Normalized expression value (NEV) is the CPM (counts per million) obtained by normalizing the raw counts by the library sizes and multiplying by one million. To train the models we used observations from the clinical trial and from the longitudinal EBA cohort for a total of 34 paired samples. We fit a model for each significant pathway using all the data from the three patients’ group (HRZE clinical trial, NTZ clinical trial, and HRZE EBA) because we wanted to find patterns that are general across multiple datasets. Each model was trained using 5000 generated trees and a train-validation partitioning of 80–20% of the data.

To finally confirm that HRZE treatment was renormalizing peripheral inflammatory pathways while NTZ was causing exacerbation we applied mixed effect modeling to predict the pairwise distance in NES between every CC/FC sample and every sample before or after treatment from the HRZE/NTZ trial and the longitudinal observational HRZE treatment cohort independently. In the first case we fit the model
