Gut microbial diversity, inflammation, and oxidative stress are associated with tacrolimus dosing requirements early after heart transplantation

Effective tacrolimus (TAC) dosing is hampered by complex pharmacokinetics and significant patient variability. The gut microbiome, a key mediator of endotoxemia, inflammation and oxidative stress in advanced heart failure (HF) patients, is a possible contributor to interindividual variations in drug efficacy. The effect of alterations in the gut microbiome on TAC dosing requirements after heart transplant (HT) has not been explored.

We enrolled 24 patients (mean age = 55.8 ±2.3 years) within 3 months post-HT. Biomarkers of endotoxemia ((lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) and oxidative stress (8,12-iso-Isoprostane F-2alpha-VI) were measured in 16 blood samples. 22 stool samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. TAC dose and serum trough level were measured at the time of stool and blood collection. TAC doses were reported in mg/kg/day and as level-to-dose (L/D) ratio, and categorized as ≤ vs. > median.

The median TAC dose was 0.1 mg/kg/day and L/D ratio was 100.01. Above the median daily weight-based TAC dose was associated with higher gut microbial alpha diversity (p = 0.03); similarly, TNF-α and 8,12-iso-Isoprostane F-2alpha-VI levels were lower and LPS levels were higher in the above median TAC group, although these findings were only marginally statistically significant and dependent on BMI adjustment. We observed n = 37 taxa to be significantly enriched among patients with > median TAC dose (all FDR<0.05), several of which are potential short-chain fatty acid producers with anti-inflammatory properties, including taxa from the family Subdoligranulum.

Our pilot study observed gut microbial alpha diversity to be increased while inflammation and oxidative stress were reduced among patients requiring higher TAC doses early after HT.

Tacrolimus (TAC) is the cornerstone of immunosuppression in heart transplant (HT) recipients [1]. Achieving and sustaining therapeutic TAC levels are essential in preventing cellular rejection in the early post-HT period [2,3]. Unfortunately, owing to its unpredictable pharmacokinetic profile and significant intra- and inter-patient variability, estimating accurate TAC dosing requirements and maintaining therapeutic levels is challenging. In the early post-transplant period, many factors can influence TAC dosing, including age, race, body habitus, anemia, liver dysfunction, malnutrition, changes in bowel functions such as ileus/diarrhea, drug-drug interactions, and genotypic aberrations (i.e. CYP3A5 carrier status) [4].

Presently, we investigate the variation in gut microbial communities, and levels of endotoxemia, inflammation and oxidative stress in a cohort of patients within the first 3 months after HT. We tested the following specific hypotheses cross-sectionally: 1) TAC dosing requirements are associated with microbial diversity; 2) TAC dosing requirements are related to levels of endotoxemia, inflammation and oxidative stress; and 3) specific microbial signatures are associated with TAC dosing requirements in the early post-transplant setting.

This was a single center cross-sectional study of adult patients who underwent HT between April 2017 and August 2018 and had stool and/or blood sampling available within the first 3 months after HT. This time frame was chosen as patients in the first 3 months post HT will have similar TAC serum trough goal levels as outlined below. Patients were enrolled in the outpatient setting during routine clinical visits or the index hospitalization for HT surgery. Demographic information (age, sex, race/ethnicity), clinical characteristics, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status, as well as concomitant drug therapy were extracted from electronic medical records. The Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol. All participants signed written informed consent.

All patients included in this study received sequential immunosuppression in accordance with the center’s protocol consisting of induction with high dose methylprednisolone, which was followed by triple maintenance therapy with TAC, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone taper. Immediate-release TAC was dosed twice daily and started on post-operative day 1, dosages were initially weight-based and subsequently adjusted to maintain initial target levels of 10 to 12 ng/mL for the first 3 months. Mycophenolate mofetil was started at 1500 mg twice daily on the day of surgery. All patients received antifungal (nystatin suspension), Pneumocystis jiroveci (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or dapsone), and antiviral (valganciclovir) post-transplantation prophylaxis for at least 6 months.

TAC levels and doses were gathered at the time of stool and blood sample collection. For evaluating the outcomes of interest, patients were divided into two groups according to their mg/kg/day TAC requirements: low-dose (below the cohort median) and high-dose (above the cohort median). Each outcome was also analyzed using dose-normalized trough levels (trough Level/Dose or L/D ratio [ng/mL]/[mg/kg/24h]), whereby low- and high-dose groups were again defined using median dichotomization. TAC levels were measured at New-York Presbyterian Hospital–CUIMC clinical laboratory using Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA). The lower limit for detection of TAC was 2 ng/mL.

Biomarkers of endotoxemia (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]), inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α)], and oxidative stress (8,12-iso-Isoprostane F-2alpha-VI levels) were measured in 16 samples collected and processed during a clinic visit or the inpatient setting. Serum TNF-α was assessed using a high sensitivity Enzyme Linked Immunoassay (ELISA) kit (RD systems, Minneapolis, MN). Plasma LPS was measured using a LAL chromogenic endotoxin quantitation kit (Pierce Thermoscientific, Rockford, IL). Plasma 8,12-iso-Isoprostane F-2alpha-VI levels was measured in butylated hydroxytoluene treated human plasma samples using LC-MS/MS on Acquity UPLC-Xevo TQS (Waters, Milford, MA).

Patients who were enrolled in the inpatient setting provided stool samples in sterile stool hats using a protocol similar to the Human Microbiome Project [10] After collection, stool samples were stored at 4°C andtransferred to the CUIMC Microbiome Core Lab within 12 hours. Ambulatory patients were provided with a stool collection kit that included ice-packs and FedEx return packaging during routine clinic visits. Stool samples were shipped to the Core lab after collection by patients at home. In the Core lab, stool was processed, aliquoted and stored at -80°C. A total of 22 stool samples were collected.

DNA was extracted from stool using the MagAttract PowerSoil DNA Kit on an Eppendorf epMotion 5075 Liquid Handling Workstation.16S rRNA sequencing was performed on all stool samples. For bacterial sequencing, we amplified the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene using standard primers with Illumina Nextera adaptors (Illumina, Madison WI). PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Jersey City, NJ) and quantified using the Quant-iT Broad Range dsDNA Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Libraries were normalized and pooled with a 10% PhiX spike and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq with a v3 kit. Negative controls were included on all sequencing runs.

Demultiplexed sequence files were processed and operationalized in R version 3.5.2, using the DADA2 pipeline (version 1.10.1) to identify exact sequence variants (ESVs) [11,12]. Reads were truncated at forward and reverse lengths of 260 and 220. We utilized a published bioinformatics workflow that utilizes DADA2 to identify ‘exact sequence variants’ and assigned taxonomy using the Silva Projects version 128 release. Descriptive statistics for the numer of sequence reads per sample were: minimum = 411, maximum = 43,775, median = 12,713, mean = 15,361.95 ± 12455.97. 16S analyses were carried out–without filtering low prevalence ESVs–using the Phyloseq package version 1.30.0. Alpha diversity (i.e., number and distribution of bacterial taxa within samples) was defined using the Shannon Index and the number of observed ESVs (we present alpha diversity results based on both rarefied (400 sequence reads) and nonrarefied data). We used a generalized linear regression model to regress Shannon index on TAC group. The p-value was derived from the type III sum of squares F-value. Analysis of beta diversity (i.e., microbial community membership similarity according to TAC dosing requirements) utilized principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index and PCoA plots of the first 2 principal coordinates were plotted according to TAC dosing requirements. PERMANOVA analysis was conducted to identify whether patient categories explained variation in microbial communities and statistical significance was determined using the Adonis test. The DESeq2 package [13] version 1.26.0 was used to evaluate whether specific taxa (ESVs) differed by TAC dosing requirements. A false discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct for multiple comparisons. DESeq2 analysis was also conducted adjusting for body mass index (BMI). BMI was abstracted from medical records and dichotomized as overweight and non-overweight, using a cut-off of 25 kg/m2. Relative abundance of the taxa found to be statistically significantly different by TAC dosing in both DESeq2 analyses were presented. Microbiota diversity measures, phylum level relative abundance (arcsine square root transformed) as well as biomarkers of endotoxemia, inflammation and oxidative stress were regressed on TAC dosing requirements in generalized linear regression models.

A total of 24 HT patients were included in this analysis: 22 had stool samples and TAC levels collected, while 16 had at least one blood biomarker available. Baseline demographics and background medication use were similar between the low- and high-dose groups, with the exception of a slightly higher BMI in the low-dose group (Table 1). The average times from HT to sample collections are summarized in S1 Table. The median TAC dose was 0.1 mg/kg/day, while the median dose-normalized ratio was 100.01. The median TAC dose among below and above median groups were 0.07 and 0.18 mg/kg/day, respectively. The median TAC levels among below and above median groups were 65.6 and 166.3 ng/mL, respectively.

Mean values of the non-rarefied Shannon index and # of observed ESVs for the overall cohort were 5.06 and 406.54, respectively. Mean values of the Shannon index and # of observed ESVs after rarefication were 4.62 and 169.14. The following results are based on nonrarefied data as the rarefied and nonrarefied values were strongly correlated (p<0.0001) (S1 Fig). Patients in the low-dose tacrolimus group had a significantly lower alpha diversity metrics (Shannon index and # of observed ESVs) as compared to the high-dose group; these findings were consistent when using both weight-based dosing (mg/kg/day) or the L/D ratio (Fig 1). These findings were unchanged after adjusting for the difference in BMI using linear regression, and were consistent between the rarified and non-rarified data (S2 and S3 Figs) Fig 2 visualizes variation in microbial community composition (Beta diversity) between low- and high-dose cohorts by both mg/kg/day and L/D ratio. In phylum level analyses, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the predominant microbes in both groups (Fig 3); while the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was numerically higher in the high-dose TAC group, this difference was not statistically significant (Fig 4). Results for other phyla are shown in Fig 3. We observed 37 taxa to be significantly enriched among patients in the high-dose group (all FDR<0.05), several of which are potential short-chain fatty acid producers with anti-inflammatory properties, including taxa from the genus Subgoligranulum, and the family Lachnospiraceae. We observed only 1 taxon, belonging to the genus Bacteroides, to be enriched among patients in the low-dose group. After adjustment for BMI, the results were even stronger with 335 taxa differing by TAC dosing group. Findings were generally similar to unadjusted analyses in that several potentially anti-inflammatory taxa, including the genus Akkermansia and family Rumninococcaceae, were elevated in the high TAC dosing group. Relative abundances of the taxa that significantly differed by TAC group in both analyses are displayed in Fig 5. DESEq2 results for the 38 taxa that differed in the unadjusted analysis are displayed in S2 Table.

Population mean values of LPS, TNF-α and 8,12-iso-isoprostane were 0.43, 1.38 and 94.24, respectively. Above the median daily weight-based TAC dose was associated with higher gut microbial alpha diversity (p = 0.03); concurrently, TNF-α and 8,12-iso-Isoprostane F-2alpha-VI levels were lower and LPS levels were higher in the above median TAC group although these findings were only marginally statistically significant and dependent on BMI adjustment (Table 2). Measures of alpha diversity were inversely correlated with isoprostane and TNF-alpha but positively correlated with LPS, although, despite strong correlations, none of these associations were statistically significant in this small study (Table 3).

In the present study, we examined the relationship between the metrics of gut microbial diversity, levels of endotoxemia, inflammation and oxidative stress and TAC dosing requirements after HT. Specifically, we found that higher TAC dosing requirements in the early (within the first 3 months) post-HT period were associated with: 1) greater alpha diversity of gut microbiota, 2) higher abundance of specific taxa with potential anti-inflammatory properties, and 3) lower biomarker levels of inflammation and oxidative stress, and higher endotoxemia, although these latter findings were only marginally statistically significant and dependent on BMI adjustment.

In conclusion, we have observed an association between gut alpha diversity and TAC dosing requirements early after HT. Future studies are needed to validate this relationship longitudinally in the post-transplant setting. Additionally, data demonstrating that pre-transplant microbial composition is related to post-transplant TAC dosing requirements would be of high clinical utility. If such an association were established, the pre-operative gut microbiome could be potentially integrated with demographic and genetic variables to better guide post-operative TAC dosing in HT recipients.
