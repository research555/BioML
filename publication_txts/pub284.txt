Characteristics and Dysbiosis of the Gut Microbiome in Renal Transplant Recipients

Renal transplantation is life-changing in many aspects. This includes changes to the gut microbiome likely due to exposure to immunosuppressive drugs and antibiotics. As a consequence, renal transplant recipients (RTRs) might suffer from intestinal dysbiosis. We aimed to investigate the gut microbiome of RTRs and compare it with healthy controls and to identify determinants of the gut microbiome of RTRs. Therefore, RTRs and healthy controls participating in the TransplantLines Biobank and Cohort Study (NCT03272841) were included. We analyzed the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA sequencing and compared the composition of the gut microbiome of RTRs to healthy controls using multivariate association with linear models (MaAsLin). Fecal samples of 139 RTRs (50% male, mean age: 58.3 ± 12.8 years) and 105 healthy controls (57% male, mean age: 59.2 ± 10.6 years) were collected. Median time after transplantation of RTRs was 6.0 (1.5–12.5)years. The microbiome composition of RTRs was significantly different from that of healthy controls, and RTRs had a lower diversity of the gut microbiome (p < 0.01). Proton-pump inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are significant determinants of the gut microbiome of RTRs (p < 0.05). Use of mycophenolate mofetil correlated to a lower diversity (p < 0.01). Moreover, significant alterations were found in multiple bacterial taxa between RTRs and healthy controls. The gut microbiome of RTRs contained more Proteobacteria and less Actinobacteria, and there was a loss of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiome of RTRs. By comparing the gut microbiome of RTRs to healthy controls we have shown that RTRs suffer from dysbiosis, a disruption in the balance of the gut microbiome.

It is becoming increasingly evident that the gut microbiome plays a role in various diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and cancer [1]. However, less is known about the role of the gut microbiome in the field of renal transplantation. Renal transplantation is the best available treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Despite improved prognosis and quality of life (QoL) compared to dialysis treatment, renal transplant recipients (RTRs) suffer from many problems in the years after transplantation. After transplantation one out of five RTRs suffers from chronic diarrhea which is associated with a lower QoL, increased abdominal complaints, higher mortality, and gut dysbiosis [2,3,4]. Furthermore, all RTRs use immunosuppressive drugs and frequently require antibiotics which potentially influence the gut microbiome [5]. Chronic diarrhea and the use of immunosuppressive drugs may change the gut microbiota composition. As a consequence, this can disrupt gut homeostasis leading to a disruption in the balance of the gut microbiome called dysbiosis. This has previously been reported in mice studies. The introduction of prednisolone and tacrolimus to mice resulted in dysbiosis, an overgrowth of Escherichia coli, and an increased colonization with opportunistic pathogens [6]. However, the gut microbiome of RTRs has not been studied extensively.

In previous studies among allogenic stem cell transplant recipients and RTRs, a lower diversity of the gut microbiome was observed [7,8]. Furthermore, this lower diversity of the gut microbiome in allogenic stem cell recipients was associated with a higher risk of mortality [9]. In addition, Annavajhala et al. demonstrated that liver transplant recipients with a lower gut microbiome diversity have a higher risk of colonization by multidrug-resistant bacteria [10]. These studies show that the gut microbiome is clinically relevant in the field of transplantation. However, the role of the gut microbiome in renal transplantation has not been adequately studied. Characterization of the gut microbiome in the first three months after renal transplantation showed significant changes in the composition of the gut microbiome and showed that diarrhea was associated with dysbiosis and a loss of diversity [8]. It is currently unknown whether dysbiosis of the gut microbiome remains prevalent more than one year after transplantation and which factors are determinants of the gut microbiota composition in RTRs. The aim of this study was to characterize the gut microbiome of RTRs for at least more than one year post-transplantation. We compared the composition of the gut microbiome between RTRs and healthy controls and identified determinants of the gut microbiome of RTRs.

We included 139 RTRs who were at least one year post-transplantation and 105 healthy donors from the TransplantLines Biobank and Cohort Study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03272841). TransplantLines is a prospective observational cohort study in solid transplant recipients [11]. Donors underwent medical screening in the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) and can be considered healthy controls. All participants were included during a study visit at the outpatient clinic of the UMCG between September 2015 and April 2018. RTRs were treated with standard antihypertensive and immunosuppressive therapy. The research protocol of the TransplantLines study was approved by the independent medical ethics committee of UMCG (METC 2014/077) and was performed in adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki and the Declaration of Istanbul. All subjects provided a written informed consent.

All measurements were performed during a study visit at the outpatient clinic. Weight, length, and waist and hip circumference were measured in duplicate. Body fat percentage was measured using the multifrequency bioelectrical impedance device (BIA, Quadscan 4000, Bodystat, Douglas, British Isles). Blood pressure was measured by qualified nurses according to a standard clinical protocol as described previously [11]. Hypertension was classified as a mean systolic pressure >140 mm Hg, and/or a mean diastolic pressure >90 mm Hg and/or use of antihypertensive medication. Diabetes mellitus was defined according to the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association [12]. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the serum creatinine-based chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula. Proteinuria was defined as urinary protein excretion >0.5 g per 24 h. Glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were determined using standard laboratory methods. Smoking status was recorded using a questionnaire. Medication use was retrieved from medical records and verified with patients during study visits. The study design is described in detail in the TransplantLines design paper [11].

Blood samples were collected after an overnight fasting period of 8–12 h and stored at −80 °C. Participants were instructed to collect a fecal sample the day prior to the study visit at home and store the sample on ice. Upon arrival at the UMCG the fecal samples were immediately stored at −80 °C. Participants also collected 24-hour urine samples the day prior to the study visit.

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from 0.25 g feces [13]. The genes for the 16S rRNA V4 and V5 region were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the TaKaRa Taq Hot start version kit (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Japan). We used the 341F and 806R primers containing a 6-nucleotide Illumina-MiSeq adapter sequence. The PCR product was purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA). DNA concentrations were measured with Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer to ensure equal library presentation for each sample, dilutions were made accordingly [14]. The normalized DNA library was sequenced using the MiSeq Benchtop Sequencer.

Bacterial taxonomy was assigned using PAired-eND Assembler for DNA sequences (PANDAseq), Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME), and ARB [15,16,17]. QIIME was used to assign taxonomy to the phylum, class, order, family, and genus level. ARB was used to assign taxonomy to the species level. As previously described, PANDAseq was used to increase the quality of sequence reads. Readouts with at quality score lower than 0.9 were discarded according to the protocol followed by Heida et al. [14].

Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for normally distributed data and median with interquartile range (IQR) for non-normally distributed data. Differences between baseline characteristics of RTRs and healthy controls were tested using a t-test or a Mann–Whitney u-test.

Multivariate analysis by linear models (MaAsLin) is a tool to find associations between clinical metadata and bacterial abundance. We used MaAsLin to find associations between microbiome data and clinical phenotype. MaAsLin performs a boosted, additive general linear model between metadata and microbial abundance [19]. Covariates including sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking, use of antihypertensive medication, use of antibiotics, use of statins, use of proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), and read depth were forced into the model. These covariates are known to influence the gut microbiome [20]. All p-values were corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate (FDR). pFDR < 0.10 was considered statistically significant for taxonomic analysis.

We included 139 RTRs (age 58.3 ± 12.8 years; 50% males) at a median post-transplantation time of 6.0 (1.5–12.5) years and 105 healthy controls (age 59.2 ± 10.6 years; 57% males). Mean BMI was 27.7 ± 5.4 kg/m² for RTRs and 27.2 ± 6.0 kg/m² for controls. In total 3 (3%) healthy controls and 38 (27%) RTRs had diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001). RTRs had a significantly higher HbA1c, 40.0 (37.0–46.0) compared to healthy controls, 37.5 (36.0–40.0) (p < 0.001). RTRs had a significantly lower eGFR of 48.3 ± 16.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared with 69.0 ± 19.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 for controls (p < 0.001). In total 7 (5%) RTRs used antibiotics, 115 (83%) RTRs used antihypertensive medication, 96 (69%) RTRs used PPIs, and 66 (47%) RTRs used statins. Cyclosporine was used by 25 (18%) RTRs, tacrolimus by 79 (57%) RTRs, azathioprine was used by 13 (9%) RTRs, mycophenolate mofetil by 100 (72%) RTRs, and prednisolone by 133 (96%) RTRs (Table 1).

All characteristics are presented as means ± standard deviation unless otherwise stated. IQR—interquartile range.

The median Shannon diversity index, a measure for the diversity of the gut microbiome, was significantly lower in RTR samples with 3.4 (3.1–3.8) vs. 3.7 (3.5–4.0) for healthy controls (p < 0.001). The median operational taxonomic units (OTUs) per sample was 256 (214–304) for RTRs and 314 (260–351) for healthy controls (p < 0.001) (Figure 1). The diversity between samples was further assessed using beta diversity analysis. The gut microbiome was significantly different between RTRs and healthy controls (p < 0.01). A separation in gut microbiota composition can be observed between RTRs and healthy controls in the principal coordinate plot (Figure 2). A permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices (ADONIS) was performed to estimate the variation explained in the gut microbiome by different variables. In total, 5.8% of the variation of the gut microbiome of RTRs and healthy controls was significantly explained by sample type (RTR or healthy control, p < 0.001). Furthermore, using ADONIS, baseline characteristics including medication use were tested in the gut microbiome of RTRs. Within the gut microbiome of RTRs age (1.2%), BMI (1.1%), and eGFR (1.0%) significantly explained variation within the gut microbiome. Furthermore, the use of PPIs (1.2%) and the use of mycophenolate mofetil (1.0%) significantly explained variation within the gut microbiome of RTRs. Age was positively correlated to the Shannon diversity index (p < 0.01). Use of mycophenolate mofetil and use of antibiotics was negatively correlated to the Shannon diversity index (p < 0.01) (Figure 3).

We analyzed the gut microbiome at different taxonomic levels: phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Using MaAsLin, we were able to identify significant differences in taxa abundances between RTRs and healthy controls while correcting for age, sex, BMI, smoking, use of antihypertensive medication, use of antibiotics, use of statins, use of PPIs, and read depth. In total, we found significant alterations in 127 of the 447 bacterial taxa abundances in the gut microbiome of RTRs (pFDR < 0.10) (Table 2). On the phylum level we found that RTRs have significantly higher levels of Proteobacteria and lower levels of Actinobacteria (pFDR < 0.10) (Figure 4). Within the phylum Proteobacteria, the species E. coli was significantly more abundant in the gut microbiome of RTRs (pFDR < 0.10). Within the phylum Actinobacteria multiple species had a lower abundance within the gut microbiome of RTRs, especially multiple Bifidobacterium species (pFDR < 0.10). The predominant phylum Firmicutes was not significantly different in RTRs compared to healthy controls. However, within the phylum Firmicutes there were many significantly different species in the gut microbiome of RTRs compared to healthy controls (Figure 4 and Table S1). An extensive overview of MaAsLin results for complete taxonomy is provided in Table S1.

We have shown that the gut microbiome of RTRs is different compared to the gut microbiome of healthy controls. Interestingly, we demonstrated that RTRs have dysbiosis characterized by general loss of microbial diversity. We found that RTRs have an increased abundance of Proteobacteria, a decrease in Actinobacteria, and a loss of butyrate-producing bacteria. Finally, we found that age, BMI, eGFR, the use of PPIs, and the use of mycophenolate mofetil are determinants of the gut microbiome of RTRs and that age, BMI, and the use of mycophenolate mofetil correlate to the diversity of the gut microbiome.

In conclusion, the gut microbiome of RTRs more than one year post-transplantation is significantly different from that of healthy controls. The gut microbiome of RTRs contains more Proteobacteria and less Actinobacteria and there is a loss of butyrate-producing bacteria which could be detrimental to gut health. The use of mycophenolate mofetil and antibiotics is associated with variation in the gut microbiome of RTRs and correlated to a lower diversity. The results of this study are preliminary and require replication in a larger cohort. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that RTRs suffer from dysbiosis more than one year post-transplantation and that the use of mycophenolate mofetil correlates to a lower diversity.
