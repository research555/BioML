Regorafenib plus toripalimab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase Ib/II clinical trial and gut microbiome analysis



This is a phase Ib/II study of regorafenib plus toripalimab for colorectal cancer. The objective response rate (ORR) is 15.2% and the disease control rate is 36.4% in evaluable patients with recommended phase II dose (80 mg regorafenib plus toripalimab). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and the median overall survival are 2.1 months and 15.5 months, respectively. Patients with liver metastases have lower ORR than those without (8.7% versus 30.0%). All patients (3/3) with lung-only metastasis respond, whereas no patients (0/4) with liver-only metastasis respond. 94.9% and 38.5% of patients have grade 1 and grade 3 treatment-related adverse events, respectively. Gut microbiome analysis of the baseline fecal samples shows significantly increased relative abundance and positive detection rate of Fusobacterium in non-responders than responders. Patients with high-abundance Fusobacterium have shorter PFS than those with low abundance (median PFS = 2.0 versus 5.2 months; p = 0.002).

Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death.1 In recent years, the quality of care for metastatic CRC (mCRC) has been continuously ameliorating over time.2 However, for refractory mCRC, therapeutic options are still limited. Regorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor against vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) and other kinase receptors to suppress tumor proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and immune escape. As one of the standard salvage-line therapies for mCRC, its objective response rate (ORR) is only 1%–4%.3,4 The benefit of immune checkpoint blockade is limited to microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or DNA deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) mCRC and is recommended by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) in its 3rd-line treatment.5, 6, 7 In contrast, microsatellite stable (MSS) or MMR-proficient (pMMR) mCRC with a poor immune cell infiltration,8 constituting ~95% of mCRC, is typically unresponsive to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade (ORR 0%).5,9 Therefore, new combination therapies are needed to improve outcomes of refractory MMS/pMMR mCRC.

As refractory mCRC remained an unmet medical need, we initiated the REGOTORI study in January 2019, as a two-part, dose escalation and dose expansion phase Ib/II study evaluating the tolerability, safety, preliminary efficacy, and efficacy-related gut microbiota of regorafenib plus toripalimab for patients with refractory pMMR/MSS/MSI-low (MSI-L) mCRC.

Forty-two patients were enrolled in phase Ib/II trial between March 2019 and January 2020; 7.7% of patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scores at 0. All patients had received ≥2 previous lines of chemotherapy and were refractory to or intolerant of fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Anti-VEGF therapy (i.e., bevacizumab) and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy (i.e., cetuximab) were used in 59.5% and 28.6% of patients, respectively. Patients were heavily pretreated with a median of 2.40 prior lines of treatments, and 69% had ≥2 metastatic sites. All patients were MSS/pMMR/MSI-L. 21 (50%) had RAS mutations and 2 (4.8%) harbored BRAFV600E mutations (Table 1).

Twelve mCRC patients were enrolled during the dose escalation phase. Regorafenib escalated from 80 mg to 120 mg and then decreased to 80 mg according to modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design (Figure 1A). Three DLTs (2 grade-3 hand-food syndrome [HFS] and 1 grade-3 transaminase elevation) occurred in 3 (100%) patients in the 120 mg regorafenib cohort (Table 2). One DLT (grade 3 HFS) occurred in 9 patients in the 80 mg regorafenib cohort (Figure 1B). As the incident rate of 11.1% was less than target toxicity probability (30%), 80 mg regorafenib plus 3 mg/kg toripalimab was determined to be the maximum tolerance dose (MDT) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for the dose expansion of 30 patients.

As of July 12, 2020, 33 patients with 80 mg regorafenib had at least one imaging tumor assessment and comprised per protocol analysis set (PPS), and 39 patients with 80 mg regorafenib comprised safety analysis set (SAF). We observed objective response in 5 patients and stable disease (SD) in 7 patients in patients with 80 mg regorafenib. The ORR was 15.2% (5/33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7%–32.7%) in PPS; the disease control rate (DCR) was 36.4% (12/33; 95% CI, 21.0%–54.9%) in PPS (Figures 2A and 2B). Among 33 evaluable patients, ORR was 15.4% (2/13), 11.1% (2/18), and 50% (1/2) in RAS and BRAF wild, RAS mutant, and BRAFV600E mutant mCRC; ORR was higher in patients without liver metastases than those with liver metastases (30% versus 8.7%); and ORR was higher in patients with lung-only metastasis (3/3; 100%) than those with liver-only metastasis (0/4; 0%; Table 3; Figure S1). Among patients with lung and liver metastases (14/33; 35.9%), ORR and DCR were 0% (0/14) and 35.7% (5/14), respectively (Table 3). Two SD patients (2/14; 14.3%) had tumor shrinkage, and one of them had obvious shrinkage in lung lesions (but stable liver lesions); one patient had disease progression after treatment (lung lesions were stable, but new lymph node lesions appeared). Tumor shrinkage of any size from baseline was observed in 9 (27.3%) patients (Figures 2A and 2B). In addition, 3 patients received 120 mg regorafenib with 1 SD and 2 progressive disease (PD) as best response (Figure 2A).

At the data cutoff of July 12, 2020, 30/33 patients had progressive disease and 23/33 patients were alive. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.1 months (95% CI, 2.0–4.3 months) in PPS (Figure 3A). 6-month PFS rate was 20.5%. Median overall survival (OS) was 15.5 months (95% CI, 10.3 months-not reached [NR]; Figure 3B). 1-year OS rate was 59.8%. For the 5 patients who achieved objective response, median duration of response (DOR) was 9.6 months (95% CI, 5.2 months-NR; Figure 3C), and responses were still ongoing in 2 patients. Patients with lung-only metastasis had much longer PFS than those with liver-only metastasis (11.4 versus 2.5 months). But no differences in OS were observed between them (NR versus NR). Patients without liver metastasis also manifested with a longer median PFS of 4.1 months and median OS not reached.

In SAF population, 94.9% patients had at least 1 treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) and 38.5% patients had at least 1 grade-3 TRAE. No grade-4 or 5 TRAEs or treatment-related deaths occurred (Table S1). Common TRAEs (≥10%) included HFS (51.3%), rash (30.8%), fever (20.5%), hoarseness (17.9%), diarrhea (17.9%), hypertension (15.4%), impaired liver function (15.4%), chest distress (15.4%), myalgia (12.8%), headache (12.8%), thrombocytopenia (10.3%), and fatigue (10.3%). The most frequent grade-3 TRAEs were HFS (10.3%) and impaired liver function (10.3%) with 2/4 of them accompanied with grade-3 hyperbilirubinemia (5.1%; Table 2). 61.5% patients experienced immune-related adverse events (irAEs), most of which were grade 1 to 2 (Table S1). Grade-3 irAE were reported in five patients (12.8%), namely rash (5.1%), impaired liver function (5.1%), and diarrhea (2.5%), which were reversible after corticosteroids treatment (Table S1). No severe adverse events occurred. In addition, 3/3 (100%) patients receiving 120 mg regorafenib developed grade-3 TRAE (Table 2).

Among the 37 patients who discontinued treatment, the most common reasons were disease progression (n = 27) followed by TRAEs (i.e., headache [n = 3], impaired liver function [n = 3], infectious pneumonia [n = 1], hand foot syndrome [n = 1], rash [n = 1], and frequent premature ventricular contractions [n = 1]; Table S1).

To explore the association of gut microbiome and the efficacy of the treatment, we performed 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing for the baseline fecal samples of 32 patients with the best clinical response of PR, SD, or PD. The patients were labeled with responders (R) (PR or SD; n = 11) and non-responders (NR) (PD; n = 21). Comparative analysis showed that the NR patients had remarkably increased abundance of Fusobacteriota and decreased Proteobacteria phylum (Figure 4A; Table S2). The alpha-diversity Shannon index of the baseline gut microbiome showed significant reduction in responders (Figure 4B; two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test; p < 0.001). Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of baseline bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity showed no significant difference between R and NR (Figure S2A; PERMANOVA; p = 0.822). To further identify the bacterial taxon related to the treat efficacy between R and NR patients, linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-effect size (LEfSe) analysis was employed. Twenty-three NR-enriched taxa and two R-enriched taxa were identified (Kruskal-Wallis test; LDA score ≥3; p < 0.05; Figure S3; Table S3). Among the enriched taxa, only 4 genera (Fusobacterium, Alistipes, Bilophila, and Acidaminococcus) were identified by LEfSe analysis, which were enriched in NR patients, although no enriched genus was identified in R patients (Table S3). Furthermore, using the best cutoff value of the relative abundance of Fusobacterium (see STAR Methods), survival analysis suggested that the patients with low abundance of Fusobacterium had significantly better PFS than those with high abundance of Fusobacterium (Figure 4C). The median PFS for patients with high-level Fusobacterium was much shorter than the patients with low-level Fusobacterium (2 versus 5.2 months; log-rank p = 0.002). Considering this observed difference of PFS might be caused by site of metastasis, we compared the clinical characteristics between high- and low-Fusobacterium group and found no significant difference in all the evaluated characteristics. Liver metastasis was found more frequently in high-Fusobacterium patients than in low-Fusobacterium patients, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (85.7% versus 54.5%; p = 0.088; Table S4; Figure S4). In addition, the relative abundance and positive detection rate of baseline Fusobacterium were higher in NR than R (Figure 4B; Table S5). Alpha or beta diversity analysis also showed no statistical differences between the patients with or without liver metastases, as well as those with lung metastases (Figures S2B–S2E).

Because the LEfSe is an algorithm for high-dimensional biomarker discovery, we combined the clinical factors of patients and the 4 genera identified by LefSe to develop a prognostic model for PFS. Univariable and multivariable CoxPH analyses resulted in a risk prediction model for PFS consisting of three covariates (body mass index [BMI], Fusobacterium, and Alistipes), which were visualized in the forest plot (Figure 4D). The baseline Fusobacterium and Alistipes levels were identified as significant risk factors of PFS with the hazard ratio (HR) of 2.68 (95% CI, 1.11–6.48; p = 0.03) and 2.56 (95% CI, 1.1–5.94; p = 0.03) respectively, while the BMI was a protective factor with HR of 0.39 (95% CI, 0.17–0.88; p = 0.02). The performance of the combination of three variates to predict PFS was illustrated by the time-dependent ROC curves (Figure 4E). The areas under the curves (AUCs) were 0.77 and 0.80 at month 3 and 6, respectively. The risk scores of patients were calculated based on the model (Table S6). The median PFSs were 1.97 months (95% CI, 1.87–2.57) and 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.04–NA) in the high-risk and the low-risk group, respectively (p = 0.005; Figure 4F).

Here, we report the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of regorafenib in combination with toripalimab (anti-PD-1 therapy) in MMS/pMMR/MSI-L mCRC patients as a salvage therapy.

In order to identify potential biomarkers for predicting clinical response to guide patient selection and therapeutic optimization, we performed gut microbiome analysis using the pretreatment fecal samples of patients in this study. Fusobacterium is a genus of obligately anaerobic filamentous gram-negative rods that are members of the phylum Fusobacteria. Although the Fusobacterium species are considered opportunistic pathogens in humans and other animals, previous studies showed overabundance of Fusobacterium might be a risk factor for disease progression from colorectal adenoma to cancer and a therapy-predictive biomarker for colorectal cancer.38,39 Our results also identified the baseline Fusobacterium of gut microbiome as the predictive biomarker in mCRC patients under the treatment of regorafenib plus toripalimab. Because the patients with low level Fusobacterium in their baseline fecal samples tended to respond to the combination of regorafenib plus toripalimab, it might be a potential strategy to improve patient outcomes by reducing the abundance of the baseline Fusobacterium. Additionally, the development of a gut-microbiome-based prediction model for PFS highlighted the important role of gut microbiome in monitoring the clinical outcome of cancer treatment.

There are several limitations of this study. The major limitations were small sample size and patient selection (who had good PS, ECOG 0 to 1). Besides, although the efficacy analysis showed the responses of patients with lung-only metastases were much better than those with liver-only metastases, the patients’ samples of both lung-only or liver-only metastases were quite small. In addition, a similar study REGONIVO was reported previously. Although the gut microbiome testing was performed, it still lacked the analysis of dynamic changes.

This study did not generate new unique reagents.

The study, both the clinical trial and microbiome analysis, was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines after approval by the ethics board in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (ID: B2019-003-05).

Chinese adults, both male and female, with histologically confirmed metastatic or unresectable MSS/MSI-L/pMMR colorectal adenocarcinoma refractory to or intolerant of fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan based systemic treatment, were enrolled in the study. Demographic information (i.e., age and gender) was provided in Table 1, and no significant association of gender with the results of the study was found. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.

Baseline fecal microbiome of the enrolled patients was sequenced to detect bacterial species that existed in the feces. The bacterial phyla in the study included Fusobacteriota, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and others. Fusobacterium was the species of interest in the study. Detailed species names, abundance of Fusobacterium, its association with clinical characteristics, and prediction for efficacy were provided in Figures 4 and S2–S4 and Tables S3–S6.

This study did not use any other models of animals, plants, cell lines, or primary cell cultures.

A total of 33 patients treated with the RP2D in the phase II dose-expansion will provide at least 90% power to show targeted efficacy of 30% ORR compared to the historical ORR of 10% using Clopper-Pearson method at a one-sided significance of 0.025, including patients with the same RP2D from phase Ib dose escalation. If > 6 patients with the RP2D have response, effectiveness could be confirmed with 90% power of test.

The current phase Ib/II clinical trial and gut microbiome analysis was a one-arm study, with no control group, and thus all the patients were enrolled in one group and fecal samples of all the patients were collected.

The primary objective of the phase Ib dose-escalation was to evaluate tolerability and safety of toripalimab in combination with regorafenib and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of regorafenib when combined with toripalimab in patients with mCRC, providing RP2D for dose-expansion. The primary objective of the phase II dose-expansion was ORR with RP2D. Secondary objectives included safety, PFS, OS, DOR, and DCR in the patients with RP2D.

The main inclusion criteria for the study were: (1) histologically confirmed metastatic and unresectable colorectal adenocarcinoma refractory to or intolerant of fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan based systemic treatment; (2) MSS or MSI-L, or pMMR; (3) an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0-1, (3) with at least 1 measurable lesion according to RECIST 1.1 criteria; (4) adequate organ function. Major exclusion criteria included: (1) previous treatment with regorafenib, PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 antibody or any other antibody that acts on T cell costimulatory or checkpoint pathways; (2) presence or history of autoimmune disease or status, or need of immunosuppressants; (3) human immunodeficiency virus infection, or active hepatitis, or other severe infection requiring systemic antibiotic treatment, or unexplained fever; (4) the presence of a serious comorbidity. All patients provided written informed consent for participation in the study.

Eligible patients were orally administered with regorafenib of 80mg, 120mg, or 160 mg [po, qd (D1-D21), q4w] and intravenous toripalimab (3 mg/kg, iv, 100 mL over 1 h ± 5 min, d1 and d15, q4w) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. In case that the lowest combination dose was intolerant, 1 mg/kg toripalimab plus 80mg regorafenib would be back up group.

The dose level was escalated according to a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design, target level of MTD (target toxicity probability) pT = 30% and equivalence interval (EI) set between [0.25, 0.35]. The number of patients to be evaluated at each dose level was three, and then every three subjects were evaluated at the same dose level once. The maximum sample size of phase Ib trial of 12 patients. At the end of the phase Ib trial, select the dose closest to the pT as MTD and RP2D (Figure 1A).

Adverse events were evaluated throughout the treatment period using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE V5.0). Tumor measurements were obtained using computed tomography at baseline and every 8 weeks until disease progression or at the beginning of subsequent treatment. Tumor response was evaluated per RECIST version 1.1. ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with the best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). DCR was defined as the proportion of patients with the best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). PFS was defined as the time from the date of enrollment until the date of disease progression or the date of death of any cause, whichever occurred first. OS was defined as the time from the date of enrollment until the date of death of any cause.

For the collection of patient feces, samples were collected and stored at −80°C until DNA isolation. Fecal bacterial DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Stool mini kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Bacterial DNA was extracted from fecal pellets. The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA encoding gene was amplified and sequenced with HiSeq Illumina platform. Raw reads were analyzed with USEARCH software (version 11) for quality control, Operational taxonomic units (OTU) clustering and taxonomy annotation. Sequences with ≥ 97% similarity were assigned to the same OTU40. Representative sequences for each OTU were screened for further annotation. For each representative sequence, the Silva rRNA gene database release 132 was used based on the RDP classifier algorithm.

Data analyses and representations were performed using R software v3.6.1. The optimal cut-off value for the abundance of Fusobacterium was determined by the surv_cutpoint () function of the “survminer” R package. Patients were classified into a high- and low- Fusobacterium group according to the threshold. The Kaplan–Meier survival curve combined with a log-rank test was used to compare the survival difference in the high- and low-Fusobacterium using the R package “survival.” Univariate and multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards Regression (CoxPH) model survival analysis were performed to identify prognostic factors (clinical factors and 4 bacterial genera). The factors were considered significant with a cut-off p ≤ 0.2. To choose the best risk prediction model for the PFS, the prognostic factors were further selected by the “step” function of R with the mode of stepwise search of “both.” The forest plot of the final CoxPH model was generated for the by the R “forestmodel” package. The predictive value of the final risk model for PFS was evaluated by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis using the R package “survivalROC,” and the 3- and 6-month area under the ROC Curves (AUCs) were visualized using the R packages “ggplot2.” The risk scores of patients were calculated based on risk model. The Kaplan–Meier survival curve combined with a log-rank test was further used to compare the PFS difference in the high- and low-risk patients using the R package “survival.” All the tests were two-tailed and p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
