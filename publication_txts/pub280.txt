American Diabetes Association and JDRF Research Symposium: Diabetes and the Microbiome

From 27–29 October 2014, more than 100 people gathered in Chicago, IL, to participate in a research symposium titled “Diabetes and the Microbiome,” jointly sponsored by the American Diabetes Association and JDRF. The conference brought together international scholars and trainees from multiple disciplines, including microbiology, bioinformatics, endocrinology, metabolism, and immunology, to share the current understanding of host-microbe interactions and their influences on diabetes and metabolism. Notably, this gathering was the first to assemble specialists with distinct expertise in type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, immunology, and microbiology with the goal of discussing and defining potential pathophysiologies linking the microbiome and diabetes. In addition to reviewing existing evidence in the field, speakers presented their own original research to provide a comprehensive view of the current understanding of the topics under discussion.

Presentations and discussions throughout the conference reflected a number of important concepts. The microbiota in any host represent a complex ecosystem with a high degree of interindividual variability. Different microbial communities, comprising bacteria, archaea, viruses, and fungi, occupy separate niches in and on the human body. Individually and collectively, these microbes provide benefits to the host—including nutrient harvest from food and protection against pathogens. They are dynamically regulated by both host genes and the environment, and they critically influence both physiology and lifelong health. The objective of the symposium was to discuss the relationship between the host and the microbiome—the combination of microbiota and their biomolecular environment and ecology—specifically with regard to metabolic and immunological systems and to define the critical research needed to understand and potentially target the microbiome in the prevention and treatment of diabetes. In this report, we present meeting highlights in the following areas: 1) relationships between diabetes and the microbiome, 2) bioinformatic tools, resources, and study design considerations, 3) microbial programming of the immune system, 4) the microbiome and energy balance, 5) interventions, and 6) limitations, unanswered questions, and resource and policy needs.

Globally, the prevalence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes is increasing. The acceleration of these diseases far outpaces the rate of genetic variation, eliminating genes as singular factors in the trend. Changes in environmental conditions, such as diet, hygiene, antibiotic use, and other medical practices, can be correlated with the growth of these diseases. Such factors may be influencing the composition and function of the microbiome in ways that significantly impact the immune and metabolic systems, contributing to the increased risk for these diseases.

As a specific example of the interactions between hosts and their microbiome, Dr. Goodman considered antimicrobial peptides. These host-derived molecules insert into the membranes of bacterial cells and provide innate defenses against infections. Many human gut commensals are resistant to antimicrobial peptides, providing a mechanism for commensal resilience (28).

The critical factors enabling the study of the microbiome have been access to gnotobiotics—animals that are GF or colonized with only defined microbes—and, in recent years, the rapid advancement of sequencing technologies and the development of elegant and powerful computational and bioinformatic tools. Physiology can be compared between GF and conventional animals, and GF animals can be “conventionalized” through the transfer of a complex microbiome. By varying experimental conditions, it is possible to identify factors that determine resilience of human gut commensal communities and to define their impact.

James Paul Brooks (Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA) specifically addressed the challenges of distinguishing microbial causality from correlation by using targeted experimental designs and statistically informed analysis approaches. Dr. Brooks outlined four challenges in the interpretation of microbial community data: 1) identifying the source (taxonomic, phylogenetic, or molecular) of a particular nucleotide sequence or other measurement, 2) identifying and controlling nonbiological biases, such as interbatch or interlaboratory measurement variability, 3) balancing discovery-based approaches with directed hypothesis tests and interventions in controlled experiments, and 4) handling microbial community dynamics and changes in the microbiome over time. While these broad areas should be considered during the design of any microbiome-related experiment, Dr. Brooks provided several specific suggestions for maximizing the effectiveness of investigations into the microbiome, including careful collection of extensive sample metadata, detailed biogeography, longitudinal sampling, replication, and the use of positive and negative controls using mock communities whenever possible.

The interplay between the microbiome and the development of the immune system is particularly relevant to autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes. Understanding the interactions between the microbiome and the developing immune system may spur the development of approaches to modify those interactions and prevent autoimmunity (Fig. 2). Andrew J.S. Macpherson (University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland) addressed the critical role of bacterial compartmentalization by intestinal mucus and its impact on the colonization and function of commensal bacteria (35). He showed that bacteria displayed distinct gene expression patterns reflecting location-specific metabolic demands and found that IgA limits motility and enhances clearance of bacteria in the small intestine but is not required for the production of colonic mucus layers (36). These results underscore the mutualistic roles of microbes and host immunity in intestinal homeostasis.

Increasing evidence suggests a critical relationship between the gut microbiome and the development and maintenance of the immune system. Given this association, there is potential for identifying protective microbial profiles for potential therapeutic use and, alternatively, potentially pathogenic microbial profiles that could be used to determine targets for modification. On the basis of the experimentation in mice, there is hope that microbial biomarkers may be able to better predict the risk for type 1 diabetes and that particular microbes or microbial metabolites could serve as future interventions to combat autoimmune destruction of β-cells, although a critical first step is defining causal relationships in humans.

As obesity is a major contributor to type 2 diabetes risk, alteration of energy balance to promote weight loss is a potentially useful strategy to combat type 2 diabetes. Studies in ob/ob (leptin-deficient) mice indicate that obesity itself may change the microbiome (46). Several physiological changes make sustaining weight loss difficult, and many of these, such as energy harvest, hormonal control of food intake, inflammation, storage of calories, and energy expenditure, offer potential mechanisms through which microbes in the gut may act to regulate body weight (47–50).

Current medical treatments target only the host. The microbiota offers another target that may allow medicine to address some of the unique environmental conditions attendant to modern society. Easily accessible, inexpensive interventions such as prebiotics and probiotics (64), as well as certain antibiotics, could be effective in stimulating the development and maintenance of a beneficial microbial community that favors weight loss and weight maintenance.

Establishing causal relationships, if they exist, between the microbiome and physiology is critical to the ultimate goal of modifying the microbiome for the prevention, treatment, or cure of diabetes. To examine the current understanding relevant to the development of future interventions, presenters focused on gut signaling pathways and the metabolic effects of clinical approaches that target the gut.

The focus on interventions highlighted promising areas of research as well as future directions required to realize the potential power of targeting the microbiome therapeutically to improve outcomes for people with, or at risk for, diabetes.

While the microbiome has been linked to many human diseases, there is a need for caution in the design and interpretation of such studies (72). Current limitations in the field were addressed at the conclusion of this conference to formulate recommendations for the standardization of study design and data analyses and for the direction of future research in the field. Limitations include the commonly used techniques for distinguishing meaningful differences in microbial composition, the need to differentiate causation from correlation, and the need to identify mechanisms of action for microbes or microbial metabolites on human health.

The conferees highlighted areas of need for research that will be required to more clearly define the impact of the microbiome on diabetes. Consensus from the discussion developed around the need to link physiological function to individual microbes or defined combinations of microbes or microbial metabolic pathways through hypothesis-driven interventional studies using standardized protocols. Exciting research goals include defining functional relationships between hosts and their microbes, which may lead to the development of new therapies; characterization of the effects of drugs and diet on the microbiome and vice versa; and identification of microbes or metabolites that can serve as biomarkers to quantify disease risk or the progression of type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes.
