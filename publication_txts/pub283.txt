Respiratory tract infections and gut microbiome modifications: A systematic review

Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are extremely common and can cause gastrointestinal tract symptoms and changes to the gut microbiota, yet these effects are poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the reported evidence of gut microbiome alterations in patients with a RTI compared to healthy controls (PROSPERO: CRD42019138853). We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane and the Clinical Trial Database for studies published between January 2015 and June 2021. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were human cohorts describing the gut microbiome in patients with an RTI compared to healthy controls and the infection was caused by a viral or bacterial pathogen. Dual data screening and extraction with narrative synthesis was performed. We identified 1,593 articles and assessed 11 full texts for inclusion. Included studies (some nested) reported gut microbiome changes in the context of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (n = 5), influenza (H1N1 and H7N9) (n = 2), Tuberculosis (TB) (n = 4), Community-Acquired Pneumonia CAP (n = 2) and recurrent RTIs (rRTI) (n = 1) infections. We found studies of patients with an RTI compared to controls reported a decrease in gut microbiome diversity (Shannon) of 1.45 units (95% CI, 0.15–2.50 [p, <0.0001]) and a lower abundance of taxa (p, 0.0086). Meta-analysis of the Shannon value showed considerable heterogeneity between studies (I2, 94.42). Unbiased analysis displayed as a funnel plot revealed a depletion of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Ruminococcus and enrichment of Enterococcus. There was an important absence in the lack of cohort studies reporting gut microbiome changes and high heterogeneity between studies may be explained by variations in microbiome methods and confounder effects. Further human cohort studies are needed to understand RTI-induced gut microbiome changes to better understand interplay between microbes and respiratory health.

Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are ubiquitous in society and place a high burden on the healthcare system. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, mean annual healthcare spending on acute RTIs was £86 million [1]. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in enormous health and societal implications, and is currently attributed to 3.7 million deaths worldwide [2]. RTIs are caused by bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens and symptoms are not limited to the respiratory tract, with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and cramps being common sequelae [3].

This systematic review aims to evaluate current reported evidence for the impact of a RTI on microbiome abundance and diversity in patients with a confirmed or suspected RTI compared to healthy controls.

We conducted and reported this systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement and registered the protocol prospectively with PROSPERO (CRD42019138853).

In June 2021 we performed a systematic search of MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP) Web of Science (WoS) and Clinical trial databases including the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Clinical Trial Database, United Kingdom (UK) Government clinical trials register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to identify studies in humans that compared the gut microbiome profiles of RTI patients to those of healthy controls. The search covered the years 2015–2021 as microbiome data have been most consistently reported during this period. The search strategy used a combination of Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and words for types of RTIs and microbiological data. The search was done twice. In the first instance with simple words and terms whereas the second search included target words to obtain recent Covid-19 related publications. The full search strategy can be seen in S1a Table and key words in S1b Table.

The full inclusion/exclusion criteria are described in S2 Table. Briefly, studies eligible for inclusion were peer-reviewed original research studies reporting gut microbiome data from patients aged over 3 years old with a suspected or proven clinical diagnosis of, or symptoms in keeping with, an RTI compared to healthy controls. Participant recruitment was from primary care, secondary care and community settings in any country. Studies were excluded if they were lacking gut microbiome data, non-human, neonates, intervention studies investigating the impact of probiotics, anxiety, diet, body mass index, drug or antibiotic usage, environmental factors such as smoking or if participants had a history of respiratory disease. A further 5 studies were excluded based on medication, antiviral or antibiotic usage in the majority of patients and did not consider these factors as a confounder, also one study did not provide a baseline or comparison with healthy control participants [20–25].

PICOS criteria were used to guide one reviewer (CAW) to screen all titles and abstracts for eligibility, and a second reviewer (AH) to perform a 10% double-screen. Full-text copies of included articles were independently reviewed. Dual screening was performed for all records by two authors (AH and LM) and eligibility disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Gut microbiome data from all studies were extracted into a purpose-built Microsoft Excel (vs 16.48) spreadsheet, summarised in S3 Table (S1 Appendix). Collected data contains descriptive variables including country of recruitment, study setting, study design, DNA extraction methods, sequence platform, bioinformatics pipelines, gut bacteria identified, number of RTI patients, number of healthy controls, age of patient and RTI causative microbe.

To assess study quality and risk of bias, the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist, including 12 questions for cohort and 10 questions for case-control studies was applied to each study. We produced a quality assessment chart based on a traffic light system of ‘good’, ‘adequate’ or ‘poor’, as recommended by Cochrane [26].

All taxa including phyla, family, genus and species of gut bacteria in RTI patients which were also reported in the control participants were recorded. Those bacteria reported as family, genus or species were allocated into the corresponding phylum. The relative abundance of each phylum was calculated as a percentage. The variation in relative abundance of each gut bacterium in RTI patients, compared to healthy controls, was reported as ‘increase’, ‘decrease’ or ‘no change’.

For specific gut bacteria, a funnel plot was used to compare the proportion of studies that reported either an increase or decrease out of the total number of studies in which they were reported (S3 Table). The proportion data was processed in in RStudio (version 1.3.1073) using the funnelR script which is based on a binomial Poisson distribution score2 and significance levels set at 50%, 80% and 95% confidence limits (Cl) [27].

The search strategy identified 1,595 articles, of which 2 were duplicates. A preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) data search and extraction was completed showing exclusion decisions (Fig 1 and S1 Appendix). Of the remaining 1,593 articles, 1,571 were screened by title and abstract from which 22 articles were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. Following an abstract review, a further 6 papers were excluded based on the PICOS exclusion criteria. A total of 16 articles were reviewed in full and 6 articles were excluded based on the PICOS criteria, leaving 11 papers eligible for inclusion in this review. In addition, a search of three clinical trial databases resulted in a total number of 66 studies, with 1 article cross-matched to the main search.

Study quality and risk of bias for all included studies were scored against cohort and case-control studies (S1 Fig). All included studies were of suitable quality and demonstrated unrestricted bias.

The characteristics of included studies are shown in Table 1.

The two main approaches for microbiome analysis are metagenome sequencing and amplicon sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene (16S). Metagenome libraries were created in four studies, whereas the rest of the studies carried out 16S profiling. Of these, two studies amplified the V4 region, four studies amplified the V3-V4 region, and one study amplified the V1-3 region. A range of bioinformatic tools are available for microbiome analysis. Two studies applied Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME2) [32], four used UPARSE [33], one used mothur [34] and one used DADA2 [35]. A range of different 16S and Archaea databases were used to assign the bacterial names from amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) including Greengenes [36], SILVA [37], Strainseeker [38], USEARCH [39], Ribosomal database project (RDP) [40] and Consensus Assessment of Sequence And VAriation (CASAVA) [41]. In three metagenome studies the Metagenomic Phylogenetic Analysis (MetaPhlAn2) [42] package was used to determine taxa from whole genome libraries. Two studies performed metabolic pathway analysis tools using MetaCyc [43], eggNOG-Mapper [44] and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [45].

The total number of reported taxa of gut bacteria in RTI patients was 115, including 8 phyla, 17 families, 55 genera and 35 species, Table 2 (and S3 Table).

Taxa abundance variation was reported as increased (green), decreased (yellow), or no change (colourless).

A total of 11 studies and nested studies reported gut microbiota modifications in patients with the following respiratory pathogens, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (n = 5), influenza infection (n = 2), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) (n = 3), Community-Acquired Pneumonia CAP (n = 2) and recurrent RTIs (RRTI) (n = 1). Nested studies reported gut microbiota modifications from two different RTI-causing pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza (subtype H1N1) [46], SARS-CoV-2 and CAP [30], recurrent TB and new TB [47]. All reported gut bacteria diversity in the context of the specific RTI pathogen are described below.

In 24 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 compared to healthy controls the gut microbiome diversity was significantly reduced [48]. Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae including genus such as Bifidobacterium, Blautia and Faecalibacterium were depleted but both Enterococcus and Streptococcus had increased abundance. A larger study with 100 SARS-CoV-2 positive participants reported depletion of key taxa including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium rectale, Bifidobacteria sp., and Actinobacteria whereas an increase was observed in Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides sp., and Ruminococcus sp [49]. A earlier study with 30 Covid-19 patients reported a decrease of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, including the genera Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, Dorea, Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcus, and species Clostridium stricto 1, Eubacterium hallii, Ruminococcus torques and whereas the abundance of Streptococcus, Rothia, Veillonella, and Actinomyces were increased [46]. Zuo et al., compared 15 Covid-19 patients with healthy controls and identified significant depletion of Bacteroidetes and genera Dorea, Faecalibacterium and Roseburia and an increase in Firmicutes, Coprobacillus sp., Clostridium ramosum, Clostridium hathewayi, Actinomyces viscosus and Bacteroides nordii [30]. A study on predominantly African American SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (n = 50) showed Corynebacterium, Campylobacter and Finegoldia were most significantly enriched while Klebsiella, Agathobacter and Fusicatenibacter were the top three genera significantly enriched in uninfected control patients (n = 34) [23].

Zuo and colleagues also recruited 6 adult patients with CAP and compared the gut microbiome to healthy controls [30]. They found depletion of Coprobacillus, Clostridium ramosum, Eubacterium ventriosum, Enterococcus faecium and Lachnospiraceae sp. In contrast, another study of 11 children (4–5 years) with CAP, their gut microbiomes were depleted of phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes plus genus Dorea, Lachnospira, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus and Anaerostipes hadras whereas enrichment was observed for phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, genera, Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Enterococcus, Escherichia and Actinomyces viscosus, Subdoligranulum sp. [50].

In 26 children with a rRTI compared to healthy controls the gut community was depleted of phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Tenericutes and Verrucomicrobia and genera including Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcus yet enriched in phyla Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and genera Escherichia and Enterococcus [51].

The gut microbiome of 46 adult patients with TB was compared to 31 healthy controls and found to depleted of phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia and nine genera, including Collinsella, Roseburia, Ruminococcus though increases were observed in phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, genus including Actinomyces, Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Parabacteroides and species Parascardovia sp., [52]. In gut microbiota from patients with both new and recurrent TB (19 and 18, respectively) there was a decrease in Bacteroidetes, genus Prevotella and Lachnospira and enrichment in Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria [47]. In comparison another study recruited 18 children with TB and showed gut bacteria depleted in phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, genera including Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Dorea, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus and F. prausnitzii yet enriched in Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Enterococcus and Prevotella [53].

A study with 26 influenza subtype H7N9 confirmed patients compared to healthy controls showed a decrease in phyla Bacteroidetes and genus including Bacteroides, Blautia, Roseburia and Ruminococcus but enrichment of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria also genera Escherichia, Clostridium and Enterococcus faecium [31]. Another study with 24 influenza subtype H1N1 confirmed patients compared to healthy controls showed depletion of phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, genera including Dorea, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, Rothia and species Ruminococcus torques whereas enrichment was observed for both Actinomycetaceae and Micrococcaceae [46].

This systematic review examined 11 studies that reported gut microbiome modifications in patients with a proven or suspected RTI, compared to healthy, matched controls. Collectively, reported gut microbiome modifications in patients with an RTI compared to healthy controls were consistently reported as decreased in diversity with a depletion of Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Ruminococcus and enrichment of Enterococcus.

This is a rapidly developing field, and our review has scratched the surface highlighting the lack of human cohort studies that definitively track gut microbiome changes during an RTI infection. The small number of studies that satisfied our inclusion criteria has emphasised the requirement for more cohort studies designed to identify gut microbiome modifications arising during RTIs, so that we can better understand interplay between microbes, respiratory health and the use of interventions such as pre- and probiotics. Also, longitudinal epidemiological microbiome studies could be used as a key tool for the identification of healthy patients most vulnerable to RTIs. Other studies might include:

We have found that patients with an RTI compared to healthy controls have a reported decrease in gut bacteria diversity and abundance within the phylum Firmicutes and unbiased analysis indicates a loss of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Ruminococcus and an increase in Enterococcus. High heterogeneity between studies may be explained by variations in by microbiome methods and confounder effects. A full comprehensive report of gut microbiome modifications due to respiratory infection was limited due to lack of suitable cohort studies therefore further human studies in this area are urgently required.
