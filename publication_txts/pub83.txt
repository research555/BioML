Mediterranean diet intervention in overweight and obese subjects lowers plasma cholesterol and causes changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome independently of energy intake



This study aimed to explore the effects of an isocaloric Mediterranean diet (MD) intervention on metabolic health, gut microbiome and systemic metabolome in subjects with lifestyle risk factors for metabolic disease.

Eighty-two healthy overweight and obese subjects with a habitually low intake of fruit and vegetables and a sedentary lifestyle participated in a parallel 8-week randomised controlled trial. Forty-three participants consumed an MD tailored to their habitual energy intakes (MedD), and 39 maintained their regular diets (ConD). Dietary adherence, metabolic parameters, gut microbiome and systemic metabolome were monitored over the study period.

Increased MD adherence in the MedD group successfully reprogrammed subjects’ intake of fibre and animal proteins. Compliance was confirmed by lowered levels of carnitine in plasma and urine. Significant reductions in plasma cholesterol (primary outcome) and faecal bile acids occurred in the MedD compared with the ConD group. Shotgun metagenomics showed gut microbiome changes that reflected individual MD adherence and increase in gene richness in participants who reduced systemic inflammation over the intervention. The MD intervention led to increased levels of the fibre-degrading Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and of genes for microbial carbohydrate degradation linked to butyrate metabolism. The dietary changes in the MedD group led to increased urinary urolithins, faecal bile acid degradation and insulin sensitivity that co-varied with specific microbial taxa.

Switching subjects to an MD while maintaining their energy intake reduced their blood cholesterol and caused multiple changes in their microbiome and metabolome that are relevant in future strategies for the improvement of metabolic health.

Diet is a fundamental factor affecting gut health. Mounting evidence highlights that diets richer in plant-based rather than animal-based foods could represent healthier choices to prevent disease.1 2 The Mediterranean diet (MD) is a recommended nutritional pattern with evidence of beneficial effects including the prevention of several types of disease, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, obesity, inflammatory diseases, degenerative diseases and cancer.3–5

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an individually tailored MD intervention in subjects at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

We investigated the gut microbiome, faecal, blood and urinary metabolomic profiles in 82 overweight/obese subjects in response to an 8-week isocaloric dietary intervention with an MD or a control diet. Each participant provided written informed consent and received no financial compensation. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT03071718). The protocol ended when the last group of participants completed the protocol (Study Start Date: June 2016; Actual Primary Completion Date: July 2017; Actual Study Completion Date: February 2019).

Eighty-two subjects (43 female and 39 male, average body mass index (BMI) 31.1±4.5 kg/m2, age 43±12 years, further baseline features in the online supplementary table 1) were selected, enrolled and randomised between the two intervention arms of the parallel study design, that is, MedD or ConD.

Each participant in the MedD group consumed an individually tailored diet that maintained the daily energy and macronutrient intake of the habitual diet and guaranteed a dietary pattern typical of the MD. Participants in the ConD group were asked to maintain their habitual diet. Individual compliance with the protocol was assessed every 2 weeks by self-recorded 7-day food diaries and physical activity questionnaires. Visits and sample collection were performed at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks (full details reported in the online supplementary material).

Untargeted urine, serum and faeces metabolomics,20 21 as well as targeted quantification of bile acids (BAs) and SCFAs in the faeces,22 23 were performed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), carnitine, choline, creatinine, betaine in plasma and urine, as well as urinary urolithins, were also determined by targeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Details are available in the online supplementary material and online supplementary tables 2–3.

A full description of the sampling, sequencing and data analysis procedures is reported in the online supplementary material. DNA libraries were sequenced using the Ion Proton Sequencer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), with a minimum of 20 million 150 bp high-quality reads generated per library. Metagenomic species pangenome (MSP)24 was used to identify and quantify species associated with the 9.9-million-gene integrated reference catalogue. The functional potentials of the intestinal gut microbiota were determined by using the in-house FAnToMet pipeline as described in the online supplementary material.

Statistical analysis and visualisation were carried out in R environment V.3.4.2 (https://www.r-project.org). ggpubr and PMCMR R packages were used to assess significant differences. Variations in dietary and clinical variables at specific time points compared with baseline values between the MedD and ConD groups were evaluated by two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures and Tukey’s post hoc test. Non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test (testRelations function of momr R package) was performed to compare means between ConD and MedD subjects at each time point, while the post hoc Nemenyi test for multiple comparisons following the Friedman test was used within each group.

Machine learning-based classification26 of metabolomics data and further details on data analysis and visualisation are provided in the online supplementary material.

No significant differences in anthropometric measures or clinical variables monitored in blood and urine samples were observed between the ConD (n=39) and MedD (n=43) groups at baseline (online supplementary table 1). Regarding the primary outcomes, as a consequence of the intervention, the participants in the MedD showed a significant decrease in total plasma cholesterol (figure 1) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol after 4 weeks compared with the ConD group (online supplementary table 1). No changes in any of the secondary outcomes such as blood glucose, serum hs-CRP, plasma insulin, TMAO or any intermediate markers of metabolic disease (glucagon, ghrelin, GIP, GLP-1, leptin, C-peptide, resistin, visfatin and PAI-1) were observed (online supplementary table 1).

Adherence to the MD significantly increased in the MedD group at 4 and 8 weeks compared with the baseline (figure 1A) and was highly correlated with the Healthy Food Diversity (HFD) index27 (online supplementary figure 2). Significant percentage changes in dietary and metabolic variables are shown in figure 1B. Participants in the MedD group significantly increased their daily intake of dietary fibre by twofold and their dietary vegetable:animal protein ratio by 2.5-fold over the intervention compared with the ConD group (p<0.001, figure 1C, D). A significant reduction in saturated fat intake and an increase in polyunsaturated fat intake was also achieved (p<0.001, figure 1E). These changes in nutrient intake in the MedD versus the ConD group were due to increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, nuts, wholegrain cereals and fish products concurrent with reduced consumption of refined cereals, dairy and meat products. The reduced consumption of meat products was confirmed by the reduction of the dietary intake biomarker of these foods in the MedD versus ConD group, that is, the concentration of carnitine in the plasma (14% and 11% reductions after 4 and 8 weeks, p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively, figure 1F) and urine (75% and 51% reductions after 4 and 8 weeks, p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively, figure 1G).

Interestingly, decrease in cholesterol levels was proportional to MD adherence rate. By applying a linear model, it was found that each unit increase in the MD index corresponded to ≃2% reduction in total plasma cholesterol (p=0.003, online supplementary figure 4), a 2% reduction in plasma LDL-cholesterol (p=0.01) and 1% reduction in plasma HDL-cholesterol (p=0.04) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI and energy intake.

We measured approximately 11 000 molecular features in all our participants during the intervention (2200 in faeces, 4125 in blood and 4645 in urine). A list of annotated metabolites is provided in online supplementary table 4 and the evidence substantiating the annotation of diet-responsive metabolites is provided in online supplementary material (online supplementary figures 5–25). Clear shifts in the metabolomic profiles were observed in the MedD group after the intervention compared with the baseline conditions and the ConD group (figure 2). Decreasing Spearman’s correlation coefficients (4 weeks vs baseline; 8 weeks vs baseline) indicated a significant change in the urine metabolic profiles after 4 (p=0.01) and 8 weeks (p=0.01) of intervention in the MedD group versus the ConD group. In order to validate the robustness of the shifts observed, we used a machine learning-based classification approach26 (area under the curve (AUC)=0.88 and 0.87 between the ConD and MedD groups at 4 and 8 weeks, respectively; as a control, AUC=0.52 was observed at baseline), which supported the metabolome changes found. In agreement with the replacement of refined cereal with wholegrain products and the replacement of meat, eggs and dairy products with fishery products, legumes and provided nuts, we found increased levels of the biomarkers of wholegrains (3-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid-glucuronide),28 legumes (tryptophan betaine),29 vegetables/berries (oxindole-3-acetic acid)30 and nuts (urolithins)31 in the MedD group, while biomarkers of meat (carnitine),32 BAs, leucine and isoleucine were more closely linked to the ConD group (figure 2). Notably, no change in urine or serum TMAO was observed, possibly due to contrasting effects of increasing intake of fish and lowering meat-derived proteins in the MedD group.

MD-mediated increase in biomarkers of wholegrain (benzoxazinoids, pipecolic acid betaine), vegetable (oxindole-3-acetic acid), legume (tryptophan betaine, pyrogallol-sulfate), nuts (urolithins) and fish (3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionic acid) consumption and decrease in meat (carnitine) and protein degradation products such as branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), aromatic amino acids, N-acetylcadaverine and microbial-derived proteolysis products (p-cresol sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, phenylacetylglutamine) was further confirmed by their significant links with the MD index (online supplementary figure 26). Finally, a range of host-derived short-chain and medium-chain acylcarnitines was significantly reduced in the urine following the MD intervention, indicating a shift in substrates for energy metabolism from fat to complex carbohydrates and protein.33

Gene (average=5 551 310.5±120 191) and MSP richness (average=230.9±53.1) metrics were maintained during the intervention. However, a significant inverse correlation was found between the variation in gut microbial gene richness and individual inflammatory status evaluated by serum hs-CRP variations (figure 3A). Subjects showing increased gene richness displayed significantly lower levels of serum hs-CRP after 8 weeks of the dietary intervention (figure 3B).

Altogether, by integrating the three meta-omics datasets,34 we observed a separation of the ConD and MedD groups on the basis of microbiome diversity, functional modules and metabolomic profiles (Hotelling T2=40.95, p<7.038e-12; online supplementary figure 31) corroborating the changes induced by the MD intervention.

We measured a number of metabolites associated with gut microbial metabolism to investigate the effect of the MD dietary intervention on health-related microbial activities. Urinary levels of urolithin glucuronides increased in the MedD compared with the ConD group (table 1). Such increase was consistently linked with the levels of urolithin producers in the microbiome, including, among others, members of the Eggerthellaceae family (online supplementary table 8), and with the consumption of nuts that were the sole dietary source of ellagitannins significantly increased in the MedD group. Interestingly, urolithin production was negatively correlated with serum hs-CRP, triglycerides, body fat mass, body weight, BMI and urinary carnitine (false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05, online supplementary figure 32).

Data are expressed as mean±SD. P values refer to variation at the specific time point compared with baseline in MedD versus ConD measured by unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

4w, 4 weeks; 8w, 8 weeks.

Despite the twofold increase in dietary fibre intake, no changes in faecal concentrations of the main SCFAs acetate, butyrate and propionate were observed. However, significant reductions in branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs), such as valerate, isovalerate, isobutyrate and 2-methylbutyrate, were observed in the faeces of the participants in the MedD group over the intervention (figure 6A–D), and these changes mirrored the increased intake of plant-based foods (FDR<0.05, online supplementary figure 32). Moreover, subjects in the quartile of the highest faecal butyrate increase at 4 weeks showed consistently higher levels of F. prausnitzii and Lachnospiraceae taxa (figure 6E, F).

The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA) was calculated as a measure of insulin resistance, and it did not change as a result of the intervention (online supplementary table 1). However, by stratifying the subjects by the variation in HOMA at 4 weeks compared with baseline, we found that subjects who reduced their HOMA on the MD intervention had significantly higher baseline levels of several Bacteroides species (including B. uniformis and B. vulgatus, p<0.05) and lower Prevotella sp. and P. copri levels (p<0.05) than subjects who did not exhibit changes in HOMA over time (online supplementary figure 34). Interestingly, P. copri baseline levels showed a positive correlation with HOMA variation over the intervention (Spearman’s rho=0.28; p=0.031).

The pangenome of the HOMA and serum hs-CRP-associated species (P. copri, F. prausnitzii, B. uniformis, B. vulgatus) was further investigated. No clear differences were found according to intervention, increase in dietary fibre consumption or decrease in HOMA indicating a high subject specificity at the strain level (online supplementary figure 36).

This study clearly shows that a change from a Western diet to a Mediterranean dietary pattern, without any concomitant change in energy intake, macronutrient intake or physical activity, modulates individual clinical outcomes, the gut microbiome and metabolome after 4 weeks of the intervention in a population with cardiometabolic risk due to unhealthy lifestyle.

Taken together, our results indicate that an MD may remodel the intestinal microbiome towards a state that promotes metabolic and cardiovascular health. In addition, our observations can be useful to plan baseline stratifications of subjects based on microbiome composition to select specific metabotypes that could be involved in ad hoc nutritional interventions to potentiate the clinical outcomes.
