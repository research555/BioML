Common Inflammatory Mechanisms in COVID-19 and Parkinson’s Diseases: The Role of Microbiome, Pharmabiotics and Postbiotics in Their Prevention

In the last decade, metagenomic studies have shown the key role of the gut microbiome in maintaining immune and neuroendocrine systems. Malfunction of the gut microbiome can induce inflammatory processes, oxidative stress, and cytokine storm. Dysfunction of the gut microbiome can be caused by short-term (virus infection and other infectious diseases) or long-term (environment, nutrition, and stress) factors. Here, we reviewed the inflammation and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases and coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Here, we reviewed the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) involved in the processes of formation of oxidative stress and inflammation in viral and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the coronavirus uses ACE2 receptors of the RAAS to penetrate human cells. The coronavirus infection can be the trigger for neurodegenerative diseases by dysfunction of the RAAS. Pharmabiotics, postbiotics, and next-generation probiotics, are considered as a means to prevent oxidative stress, inflammatory processes, neurodegenerative and viral diseases through gut microbiome regulation.

Inflammation and oxidative stress are common symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases and viral infections such as Parkinson’s disease and COVID-19. The immuno pathogenesis induced by SARS-CoV-2 disrupts the immune system, leading to inflammatory responses. It is reported that COVID-19 enters the cell by interacting with the angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor ACE2 and transmembrane serine protease-2 TMPRSS2.1–3 Therefore, serum angiotensin 2 AngII levels increase as a result of its reduced degradation by ACE2. Accumulated AngII has been shown to activate inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-gamma, followed by interferon gene stimulation, resulting in increased cytokine storm and associated acute respiratory distress syndrome, as seen in severe disease.1,4–6 Moreover, activation of cytokines leads to hyperactivation of downstream signaling cascades, including nuclear transcription factor kappa B NF-κB, which is usually activated by SARS-CoV-2 itself via pattern recognition receptors.1,5,7

The microbiome-gut-brain axis explains the mutual regulation of the nervous system and the gut microbiome through immunological, neurological, and neuroendocrine systems.43,44 Imbalance the microbiome-gut-brain axis under adverse factors, such as antibiotics, stress, food quality45–47 weakens the intestinal barrier and cause the formation of pathological processes such as chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, Alzheimer’s disease and neurodegenerative diseases.47–49 It has been shown that inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract increases neuroinflammatory processes,50,51 which can be a consequence of the malfunction of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system (RAAS).52,53 The RAAS is involved in the mechanisms of the formation of inflammatory processes in the human body.54,55 The virus COVID-19 uses ACE2 receptors of the RAAS to enter into human cells and launches neurodegenerative processes by RAAS dysfunction.56 Understanding the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis prevents oxidative stress, inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes by correcting the gut microbiome. Probiotic bacteria with antioxidants include lacto- and bifidobacteria, as well as some species of propionic acid bacteria and enterobacteria,57–59 antimutagenic, immunomodulatory, and antitumor properties, can be used for the correction of the gut microbiome in modern methods of therapy.60–63 In modern therapy, not only do probiotics play an important role, but also postbiotics - their metabolites and components. Lately, pharmabiotics have become popular in medical practice. Pharmabiotics are preparations based on probiotics and their metabolites with a known composition of active substances, deciphered mechanisms of their action, and proven efficacy and safety.64–66

Oxidative stress is an event caused by an imbalance between the production and accumulation of oxygen reactive species in cells and tissues and the ability of a biological system to detoxify reactive intermediates or repair damages.32 In order to maintain proper cellular homeostasis, a balance must be struck between the production and consumption of reactive oxygen.32 Oxidative stress is caused by the main reactive oxygen species: superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals HO−, lipid peroxide radicals, and hydrogen peroxide H2O2.32

However, reactive oxygen species are not always harmful and can be beneficial as they are used by the immune system as a way to attack and kill pathogens.81 Short-term oxidative stress may also be important in the prevention of aging by induction of a process named mitohormesis.82 Also, reactive oxygen species play an important role in cell signaling, a process called redox signaling.32

Although viruses can replicate in several cell types, the pathological outcome only appears in one or a few tissue-specific cells.83 The primary encounter with the virus occurs in mononuclear phagocytic cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells.83 The stimulation of the innate and adaptive immune system in response to viral infections destroys infected cells, inducing inflammation that may lead to severe pathological consequences for the host. The damage of cells caused by the immune system with a viral infection is known as virus-induced inflammation.83–85

In severe cases of certain viral infections, as in avian influenza H5N1 and coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, aberrant induction of the host immune response can elicit a flaring release of cytokines known as a cytokine storm.83,88 There is evidence for the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a fatal human demyelinating disease caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV), in patients treated with Natalizumab monoclonal antibodies.89 The JCV virus is detected in 70–90% of the world’s population, which can cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in people with weakened immune systems.90,91 About 50% of patients with viral multifocal leukoencephalopathy die within a few months after diagnosis. Several studies indicate the association of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with the development of multiple sclerosis.89,92 The high incidence of multiple sclerosis in people who have undergone EBV infection may serve as evidence of the primacy of inflammatory processes in the remitting and progressive course of multiple sclerosis.93 Another virus associated with the development of multiple sclerosis is the Human Herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6), which is involved in triggering autoimmune reactions.94–96 An inverse relationship has been found between the age of HHV-6 infection and the risk of developing multiple sclerosis in the future. The MS-associated retrovirus (MSRV) may be transactivated by external risk factors for multiple sclerosis such as HHV-6 and EBV viruses. Thus, various infectious agents (JCV, MSRV, HHV-6, EBV, and SARS-CoV-2), provoking inflammation, can be triggers of progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and multiple sclerosis.89,97

Oxidative stress and the inflammatory process it causes are able to form neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis.98 Chronic inflammation in the small intestine as a result of infection can lead to the activation of glial cells of the enteric nervous system, mainly nerve fibers of the autonomic nervous system, and a violation of the conformational properties of proteins, namely, α-synuclein. Subsequently, the molecules of pathological forms of α-synuclein trans synaptically penetrate the central nervous system along the afferent fibers of the vagus nerve and begin to exhibit prion-like properties affecting the dorsal nucleus and neurons of the caudal trunk.99,100 Disturbances in the composition of the gut microbiome are closely associated with delayed colonic transit, olfactory dysfunction, emotional-affective disorders, and depression.41,101,102

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune neurodegenerative disease in which the myelin sheath of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord is affected.103 At certain stages, the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease may have common features. The progression of Alzheimer’s disease is associated with the accumulation of the pathological protein β-amyloid and neurofilaments and amyloid plaques formed from it in the brain. In multiple sclerosis, accumulation of the β-amyloid precursor in axons around amyloid plaques was also found, the concentration of which positively correlates with the stage of the disease.93 The neurodegenerative process and inflammation in multiple sclerosis can be enhanced in the case of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative injury of neurons. The α-synuclein protein, which is responsible for the development of neurodegeneration, is also involved in the development of multiple sclerosis. The concentration of α-synuclein increases with opticomyelitis and exacerbation of multiple sclerosis.104 There is evidence of acceleration of the neurodegenerative process under conditions of activation of systemic inflammation.105

Viral pandemic coronavirus infection COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus) leads to a wide range of functional consequences,106 capable of infecting most organs and systems in human, including the gut microbiome107–109 and central nervous system.110

The spike glycoprotein on the viral envelope of the coronavirus can bind to specific receptors on the membrane of host cells. Previous studies have shown that ACE2 is a specific functional receptor for SARS-CoV.111 It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 can enter cells expressing ACE2 but not cells without ACE2 or cells expressing other coronavirus receptors such as aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase 4, confirming that ACE2 is a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2.3,111 Further studies have shown that the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 thorn glycoprotein with ACE2 is 10–20 times higher than that of SARS-CoV with ACE2.111,112 The probable mechanism of penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells consists in binding the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein with the tip of the ACE2 subdomain.111–115 The fusion of the viral and host cell membranes is activated upon binding, and the viral RNA is subsequently released into the cytoplasm, causing infection. During SARS-CoV infection, intact ACE2 or its transmembrane domain is internalized together with the virus.111,116 The catalytically active site of ACE2 is not overlapped by the thorn glycoprotein, and the binding process does not depend on the peptidase activity of ACE2.111,114

Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild clinical manifestations to severe illness.117,118 Common clinical manifestations include headaches, loss of smell and taste, nasal congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever, diarrhea, and breathing difficulties.119,120 The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide variety of cells and body systems. COVID-19 is best known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).121 The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, as the virus gains access to host cells through the receptor for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ACE2, which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar lung cells.122 The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a spike to bind to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell.123 COVID-19 leads to diffuse damage to the alveoli and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.124,125

Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing airway epithelial cells, people with severe COVID-19 show symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. The increased levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF, interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 IP-10, chemoattractant protein of monocytes 1 MCP1, inflammatory protein of macrophages 1 - alpha MIP-1 alpha, and tumor necrosis factor TNF-alpha, indicative of cytokine release syndrome, suggest an underlying immunopathology.132 Also, people with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome have classic serum CRS biomarkers, including elevated levels of C-reactive protein CRP, lactate dehydrogenase LDH, D-dimer, and ferritin.133 Systemic inflammation leads to vasodilation, which leads to inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lungs and heart. In particular, pathogenic T cells secreting GM-CSF have been shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL-6 and severe lung disease in people with COVID-19.125,134

The severity of the inflammation caused by COVID-19 can be attributed to the severity of the so-called cytokine storm.135 Levels of interleukin 1β, interferon gamma, interferon-induced protein 10, and monocytic chemoattractant protein 1 were associated with the severity of COVID-19 disease. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 disease.136

The cytokine storm occurs due to an acute hyperinflammatory reaction that causes clinical disease in a variety of diseases, but in COVID-19 this is associated with a worse prognosis and increased mortality.137 The hurricane causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, blood clotting phenomena such as strokes, myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury, and vasculitis. The production of IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and interferon-gamma, all essential components of a normal immune response, inadvertently becomes the cause of the cytokine storm. Central nervous system cells, microglia, neurons, and astrocytes are also involved in the release of proinflammatory cytokines that affect the nervous system, and the effects of cytokine storms on the central nervous system are not uncommon.137,138

Oxidative stress has recently been proposed as a key factor in COVID-19.139–141 The mechanism includes the activity of ACE2, which cleaves the octapeptide angiotensin II Ang II, which was previously generated by ACE.139 Since Ang II is a potent vasoconstrictor that plays a key role in raising blood pressure, its treatment with ACE2 induces vasodilation, enhanced by the formation of Ang 1–7, a peptide with potent vasodilating functions that are generated during this process.139 The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 causes the virus to enter cells and, in turn, reduces the bioavailability of ACE2.139 Due to the protective function of ACE2, a decrease in its levels is associated with unfavorable clinical phenotypes, and its key role in the pathogenesis of SARS-Cov-2 has been described.139,142 Evidence has shown that Ang II regulates the activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPH oxidase143–146 and binds to angiotensin type 1 receptor AT1R.139,147 The activation of oxidase is one of the main factors in the formation of reactive oxygen species including the superoxide radical anion O2- and hydrogen peroxide H2O2.139 Therefore, the decreased bioavailability of ACE2 after SARS-CoV-2 binding allows Ang II to be available to interact with AT1R, which mediates signals for NADPH oxidase activation and induces oxidative stress and inflammatory responses that in turn contribute to the severity of COVID-19.139,148,149 It was shown, that NADPH oxidase-2 is overexpressed in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, causing increased oxidative stress.139,150

Inflammation and the immune response Coronavirus subtypes such as SARS-CoV and especially SARS-CoV-2 are capable of actively causing the so-called cytokine storm by mediating the increased production and release of proinflammatory cytokines,151 which confirms the high levels of inflammatory markers found in patients with COVID-19.132,139,152–155 Interestingly, one of the identified markers is the nonspecific C-reactive protein, a widely used biomarker for the diagnosis of sepsis.139 In addition, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been associated with the severity of COVID-19 and death.132,139,152–155 Elevated plasma concentrations of interleukins such as IL-1 β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10 or IL-17, interferon γ, interferon γ-induced protein 10, chemoattractant monocyte protein 1 MCP1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α and tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNFα, among others, have been identified as inflammatory mediators in COVID-19.132,139,156–160 Importantly, macrophages and neutrophils also play a potential pathological role during SARS-CoV-2 infection161 by producing numerous reactive oxygen species including, but not limited to, H2O2, O2-, and hydroxyl radical OH.139,162 Oxidative stress affects the immune system by altering immune cell function and inflammatory response.139,163,164 The systemic cytokine profiles observed in patients with severe COVID-19 are similar to those seen in cytokine release syndromes such as sepsis, with increased production of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, and other pro-inflammatory chemokines, including chemokine CC ligand 2 CCL2, CCL3 and chemokine CXC ligand 10 CXCL10.139

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects human movement. The etiology of Parkinson’s disease is still a matter of debate,165,166 while the number of clinical cases is growing steadily.167,168 Parkinson’s disease is now recognized as a multisystem disease. The neurochemical and pathomorphological basis of Parkinson’s disease is the death of neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain and the subsequent depletion of dopamine reserves in the striatum.168

It has been shown that parasympathetic neurons of the intestinal submucosa and exogenous alimentary factors such as infectious and toxic are involved in the early stage of development of Parkinson’s disease.99 There is evidence that a shift in the composition of the gut microbiome may play an important role in the initiation and progression of Parkinson’s disease, as a result of the upward diffusion of α-synuclein from the parasympathetic nervous system of the gut to the brain.172

Parkinson’s disease is currently the second most common neurodegenerative disease, the incidence of which is expected to increase in the coming decades due to increased life expectancy.173,174 Although most cases of Parkinson’s disease occur sporadically, a small subset of Parkinson’s disease cases are hereditary and are attributed to mutations in genes associated with PARK loci including SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1, NURR1, OMI/HTRA2, and LRRK2 associated with the disease. Many theories have been proposed for the etiology of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease,174–177 but none of them provide a solid basis for explaining all symptoms. Indeed, some authors shrewdly view Parkinson’s disease as a syndrome with various possible etiologies.174,178–180 While the exact cause of Parkinson’s disease is currently unknown, scientists have come up with the following possible theories of this disease etiology: based on genetics, based on the environment, based on the presence of Lewy bodies, based on the presence of alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies. According to genetics-based theory, there are certain genes that, when they become mutated, cause Parkinson’s disease. However, these mutated genes are very rare, except in cases where Parkinson’s runs in the family. There are also some gene variations that seem to slightly increase the risk of developing Parkinson’s.174 According to environment-based theory, there are some environmental factors and toxins which may trigger Parkinson’s disease, although they feel the increased risk is small. According to theory based on the presence of Lewy bodies, changes happening within the brain may also be a trigger for Parkinson’s disease. Lewy bodies are proteins found in brain cells that are biomarkers of the disease and may hold the key to finding out the exact cause.174 According to theory based on the presence of alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies, alpha-synuclein proteins form clumps in the cells which are thought to contribute to the disease. In the environmental toxin hypothesis, progressive neurodegeneration of Parkinson’s disease may be caused by chronic exposure to a neurotoxin or limited exposure to initiate a self-replicating cascade of deleterious events.174,181 It is possible that the idiopathic manifestation of Parkinson’s disease depends on several factors, such as individual nuclear/cytosolic protein variants, endosymbiont mitochondria, and microorganisms, which will synergistically contribute to the development of the disease.174,177,182

Some bacteria contain immunoreactive motifs that are potent IgA inducers, as observed in multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease.174,193 This emphasizes the role of the gut microbiome as the main participant in the dynamic migration of plasma cells between the gut and the brain.174,194–196 However, it is interesting to ask why the immune-stimulating bacteria in the gut can lead to the recruitment of regulatory immune cells to the central nervous system.174,195,197 It can be explained that a breached intestinal barrier may allow gut microbiome–specific immune cells to act as systemic mediators able to penetrate the central nervous system during acute neuroinflammation.174,195,198 Recent reports show that gut-derived IgA plasma cells are present in meningeal venous sinuses of slow blood flow whose fenestrations can potentially allow access of blood-borne pathogens into the brain.174,194

The RAAS is a vital system of the human body, as it maintains plasma sodium concentration, blood pressure, vascular tone, and extracellular fluid volume, carries out tissue remodeling, and produces pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects. Renin and angiotensin are two of the most important constituents of RAAS.199 Renin, or angiotensinogenase, is secreted by the granular cells of the kidneys and is found in several isoforms containing 340 amino acids with antagonizing functions.200 Renin is also considered a hormone because it has a signaling function. The enzyme renin acts on its substrate to form angiotensin II, a universal effector peptide hormone.201

Chronic activation of the RAAS leads to the onset and development of congestive heart failure syndromes, systemic hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Excessive levels of circulating and tissue angiotensin II and aldosterone lead to a pro-fibrotic, inflammatory, and hypertrophic environment that causes remodeling and dysfunction in cardiovascular and renal tissues.212

Of particular interest is the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and the RAAS via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ACE2, a receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to gain access to cells.137 The RAAS system includes a carefully balanced and controlled hormone and receptor cascade involving multiple organ systems.137 The system is primarily responsible for blood pressure control, maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance, and maintaining systemic vascular resistance.137,213

Now it is generally accepted that the ACE2 receptor protein is found on the endothelium in various human organs, including the skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, and kidneys, and the brain, as well as the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose, nasopharynx, lungs, stomach, small intestine, and colon, while ACE2 mRNA is found in almost every organ.137,217 The most notable finding is the surface expression of the ACE2 protein on alveolar epithelial cells of the lungs and enterocytes of the small intestine.137,217 This is especially important when considering the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of patients infected with COVID-19.137 Once the cell becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 is internalized and ACE2 expression is reduced.137 Therefore, the beneficial degradation of AngII to counter-regulatory Ang (1–7) is reduced, leading to undeniable effects of AngII/AT1,222 a theory supported by the finding of elevated AngII levels in COVID-19 infected patients.137,222,223

It is known that the RAAS system may also play a role in Parkinson’s disease.224 Although the exact cause of this progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the basal ganglia remains unclear, it is assumed that inflammation and oxidative stress are key factors in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease.224 Since angiotensin II is a pro-inflammatory compound that can induce the production of reactive oxygen species due to the activation of the NADPH-dependent oxidase complex, this peptide can contribute to the death of dopaminergic cells.224 There are three different strategies for intervening in the pathogenesis or progression of Parkinson’s disease.224 These include inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE, blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor AT1, and stimulation of type 2 angiotensin II receptor AT2.224 Since angiotensin II is a pro-inflammatory compound225 that activates the NADPH-dependent oxidase complex, the main source of superoxide,226,227 it is possible to regulate the progression of Parkinson’s disease by manipulating the RAAS system.224

The structures of the basal ganglia have a local RAAS, which indicates increased activity during dopaminergic degeneration.229,243–245 Villar-Cheda et al,229,246 reported that a decrease in dopaminergic activity caused by reserpine led to a significant increase in the expression of AT1 and AT2 receptors.229 A similar pattern was observed in 6-OH-dopaminergic dopaminergic denervation, in which a decrease in receptor expression was observed upon treatment with the dopamine precursor 1-DOPA.229 These results indicate a direct interaction between the RAAS and the dopaminergic system in the structures of the basal ganglia.229

The RAAS plays a key role in inflammatory processes that affect the microbiome, COVID-19 infection, and the development of Parkinson’s disease. The universal role of the RAAS system in the formation of inflammatory processes leading to many chronic diseases accompanied by inflammatory processes requires further study and more detailed analysis in the post-COVID-19 time. Persistent dysbiosis after COVID-19 can be a factor in multisystem inflammatory syndrome with unpredictable consequences in recovered patients.

ACE and ACE2 have also been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis.264 Zubenko et al found a decrease in the level of ACE in the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with Parkinson’s disease,248,265 and Kawajiri et al revealed a decrease in ACE and ACE2 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis.248,266–268 However, there are few studies on the role of ACE2 in the pathological processes of Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis, and it is necessary to study the specific mechanism.248,269

Lactobacillus is a genus of Gram-positive, aerotolerant anaerobes or microaerophilic, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacteria of the family Lactobacillaceae, order Lactobacillales, class Bacilli, division Firmicutes. Lactobacillus can grow at temperatures ranging from 2° to 53°C and at pH levels ranging from 3 to 8. The optimum temperature for lactobacteria is 30–40°C, and pH 5.5–6.2. Lactobacillus is capable of breaking down carbohydrates, nitrates do not reduce, casein does not break down, gelatin does not liquefy, does not form indole and hydrogen sulfide.32

The Lactobacillaceae family is one of the most numerous in the bacterial world.270 The Lactobacillaceae family has high phenotypic, ecological, and phylogenetic diversity.271 Lactobacillus is divided into 26 phylogenetic groups and comprised over 260 phylogenetically, ecologically, and metabolically diverse species, the most famous of which are L. casei (L. casei, L. rhamnosus species), L. reuteri (L. reuteri, L. fermentum species), L. plantarum, L. acidophilus (L. acidophilus, L. helveticus), L. delbrueckii, L. brevis, L. salivarius.272,273

Lactobacteria are found on plants, in various cavities of animals and humans, in dairy and fermented foods, and organic wastes.274 According to their lifestyle, lactobacteria are subdivided into free-living including ecological and plant isolates, host-adapted including invertebrate or vertebrate hosts, and nomadic species.275 Most of the species of lactobacteria found in the human intestine do not form stable populations and are classified as allochthonous, which are ingested with food. The species L. plantarum, L. casei, L. paracasei, and L. rhamnosus are not autochthonous in the classical sense but have an adaptation to the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and oral cavity that allows them to persist there for a long time.276

Lactobacteria have always been used by humans for food fermentation, are considered safe for humans, and have been classified as generally regarded as safe GRAS, which can be used as probiotics to maintain health. By releasing biologically active substances, lactobacteria can prevent pathological conditions such as decreased levels of neurotransmitters, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, neurodegenerative diseases, ulcerative colitis, inflamed bowel syndrome, and allergies.278–282

The ability of certain strains of probiotic bacteria to reduce oxidative stress is widely known and proven in vitro and in vivo. The antioxidant effect of probiotics is due to the production of antioxidant proteins and peptides (superoxide dismutase, thioredoxin, glutathione; proteins that chelate ions Fe2+ and Cu2+; vitamins (B1, B12, and others; short-chain fatty acids; refolding stress-damaged proteins; modulation of the species composition of the intestinal microbiome.32,283 Examples of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of lactobacteria (Table 1).

The knowledge accumulated in recent years about the antioxidant activity of lactobacteria makes it possible to formulate requirements for an ideal strain that reduces oxidative stress in the body. An ideal probiotic drug capable of reducing cytokine storms and oxidative stress in viral infections and COVID-19 should have the following characteristics.283,333–335 The probiotic strain should have direct antioxidant activity and have a complex effect on the innate immune and antioxidant systems of the human body. The probiotic strain must be a natural and complementary component of the human intestinal microbiome. The probiotic strain must have the ability to mildly mobilize the antioxidant potential of the target cells of the human body.334 The probiotic strain must be able to regulate the concentration of reactive oxygen species in the targeted organs of the body, for example, in the lungs. The probiotic strain must be capable of detoxifying the lipids, proteins, and other components damaged by reactive oxygen species in human cells.335 The probiotic strain should help restore the intestinal and blood-brain barriers that prevent the penetration of toxicants into the bloodstream and the brain. The probiotic strain should contribute to the restoration of the gut microbiome, which is an important organ that determines the immunomodulatory and antioxidant potential of a human.59,289,333–335 These properties are possessed by the probiotic strain of Lactobacillus fermentum U-21, which is capable of synthesizing a complex of antioxidants with proven high antioxidant activity against superoxide anion. Biologically active compounds obtained from the biomass and culture medium of the L. fermentum U-21 strain also have antioxidant activity against superoxide anion and can be used in pharmacology and medicine in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases induced by oxidative stress, as well as in cosmetology with an increase in antioxidant status of skin.59,289,290,333–335

Metagenomic studies show changes in the species composition of the gut microbiome of people with various diseases compared with healthy people.336–341 Changes in the structure of the gut microbiome can be observed in humans with diseases such as obesity and metabolic dysfunction,342 allergies, and autoimmune disorders,343–345 intestinal inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome, allergic gastroenteritis and necrotizing enterocolitis,346 type 1 and 2 diabetes,347 atherosclerosis,348 asthma349 neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson’s disease.350 Experimental and clinical studies have revealed changes in the structure of the human gut microbiome as a result of degenerative diseases,281 depression,351,352 and autism,41,353 which are accompanied by inflammatory processes.354–356

Currently, several studies are aimed at identifying differences in the microbiome of patients with Parkinson’s disease compared to healthy control people.350 While most of them used fecal samples as a proxy for microbiome composition in the distal colon, some examined mucosal opportunistic pathogens or even saliva and nasal mucosa samples.350,357–359 The species of the Prevotellaceae family from the Bacteroidetes phylum have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease193 and have dramatically decreased in the stool of patients with Parkinson’s disease190,193,337,338,360–364 and in the sigmoid mucosa.350,357,365 It has been reported lower Bifidobacteriaceae levels in patients with Parkinson’s disease.338,350 It was found a lower content of Bifidobacteriaceae both in the mucous membrane and in the feces350,357,366 and the saliva350,367 of patients with Parkinson’s disease compared to controls, while others described the opposite.350,362,368,369 In a mouse model of Rotenone-induced Parkinson’s disease, the number of Bifidobacteriaceae in the cecal and mucous membrane was reduced compared to control mice.350,370 It was found an increased content of Lactobacillaceae,350,362–364,366,367,369,371 and Erysipelotrichaceae,350,359,364,372 in the saliva and the stool of patients with Parkinson’s disease compared to the control group whereas some other studies found decreased content of Lactobacillaceae338,350,372 and Erysipelotrichaceae338,350,357,369 in the stool of patients with Parkinson’s disease compared with healthy controls. The genera Roseburia,338,357,366 Blautia338,357,366,369 and Faecalibacterium190,357,369 and Dorea337,338,357 were less abundant in the stool of patients with Parkinson’s disease.350 Genus Akkermansia was common in the stool of patients with Parkinson’s disease.190,338,350,357,359,364,366,373 Akkermansia muciniphila can induce different T cell responses depending on other species present in a given microbiome.350,374 Also, it has been reported the increasing the viruses in the stool.

It has been published that COVID-19 patients had an altered gut microbiome compared to the control group.375–379 Using a shotgun for metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples it is described dysbiosis in the bacterial microbiome and mycobiome in patients with COVID-19 compared with healthy control patients.375,376,379 Notably, COVID-19 patients generally had an increased number of opportunistic pathogens, a portion of the commensal microbiome that can become pathogenic in the event of a host disorder such as dysbiosis or a compromised immune system.379,380 Opportunistic pathogens included Clostridium hathewayi, Actinomyces viscosus, and Bacteroides nordii at the time of hospitalization with SARS-CoV-2.379 It is shown that the number of specific opportunistic pathogens, Collinsella aerofaciens and Morganella morganii spp. was increased in fecal samples with a high level of active viral transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2 compared to fecal samples from healthy patients.376,379 Conversely, fecal samples with low or no SARS-CoV-2 infectivity had elevated levels of bacteria belonging to Parabacteroides, Bacteroides, and Lachnospiraceae that produce short-chain fatty acids, especially butyric acid.379 Short-chain fatty acids are known to play an important role in enhancing host immunity. Thus, these data suggest that opportunistic pathogens pose a threat to both a decrease in host immunity and opportunistic infections in proportion to the burden of SARS-CoV-2.379 In another cohort, reduced bacterial diversity was described in fecal samples from patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy controls by analyzing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.377,379 The study also found an increase in opportunistic pathogens such as Streptococcus, Rothia, Veillonella, and Actinomyces among COVID-19 patients.379

The feces of COVID-19 patients were enriched with opportunistic pathogens known to cause bacteremia, including Clostridium hathewayi, Actinomyces viscosus, and Bacteroides nordii375,376 due to the disturbed microbial ecology of the intestine and resistance to colonization.376,384,385 It showed a similar pattern of gut microbiome dysbiosis in patients with COVID-19.376,386 The number of butyrate-producing bacteria such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium leptum, and Eubacterium rectale was significantly reduced in patients with COVID-19 compared with the control group.376,386 When patients with COVID-19 were compared to the control group, the number of common opportunistic microorganisms Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus was significantly higher.376,386 At the birth level, the genera of Streptococcus, Rothia, Veillonella, and Actinomyces (all opportunistic microorganisms) were enriched with feces from patients with COVID-19, while the deliveries of Romboutsia, Faecalibacterium, and Fusicatenibacter were enriched with feces from healthy people.376,377 The content of opportunistic bacteria Coprobacillus, Clostridium ramosum, and Clostridium hathewayi in the feces of patients during hospitalization was associated with COVID-19 disease, while the anti-inflammatory bacterium Faecalibacterium prausnitzii showed a negative correlation,375 which suggests a baseline calibration of the intestinal microbe-host immunity, thereby influencing the disease response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.376 Evidence is accumulating that a significant number of COVID-19 patients experienced systemic and organ-specific disease during follow-up after resolution of the disease, including fatigue, muscle weakness, sleep problems, anxiety, depression, diarrhea, and poor glycemic control.132,376,387–389 The long-term dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is also consistently observed in patients after COVID-19,375,390–392 which means that the gut microbiome is closely related to the health of the host.376

The microbiome and its specific components, including lactobacteria, determine the formation and maintenance of innate and acquired immunity, as well as antioxidant potential. Violation of the composition (signature) of the microbiome - dysbiosis, leads to increased sensitivity to infectious and neurological diseases. The immune status of different groups of the population has different indicators: first of all, patients with type II diabetes, autoimmune diseases, AIDS.32 Stressful conditions (social, physical, chemical, nutritional changes) always lead to dysbiosis of the microbiome and a decrease in immune homeostasis. Analysis of the state of the microbiome is an important biomarker of the state of the immune and nervous system and susceptibility to neurological and infectious diseases as COVID-19.32,393,394 The intestinal microbiome influences the host organism due to its ability to synthesize various biologically active compounds. The whole system functions as a single network. A breakdown in one link leads to the failure of the entire system32,41,319,393,395 (Figure 3).

Viruses that can infect both intestinal epithelial cells and symbiotic microorganisms have a significant effect on the composition of the intestinal microbiome.376,425,426 The gut microbiome is the primary antiviral barrier, which, using the CRISPR-Cas system, provides effective protection of symbiotic bacteria from various DNA and RNA viruses, phages, as well as COVID-19.425,427,428 One of the mechanisms of antiviral defense of the gut microbiome is a complex of exosomes of bacterial and human origin. Exosomes can capture viral particles, including COVID-19, and carry them into bacterial cells, where they are destroyed.429–432 Another mechanism of antiviral defense of the intestinal microbiome is the production of peptides and biologically active metabolites that can prevent viruses from entering cells. Microorganisms of the gut microbiome can synthesize peptides that are able to competitively bind to ACE2 cell receptors, block them from binding to COVID-19 and protect the intestinal epithelium from coronavirus infection and subsequent inflammatory processes.433 It has been shown that bifidobacteria, in particular Bifidobacterium longum GT-15, can reduce intestinal inflammatory processes by producing the type-III fibronectin domain-containing protein (FN3) that binds to a pro-inflammatory agent such as tumor necrosis factor α TNFα.434,435 The gut microbiome of people resistant to coronavirus infection is a promising source of Lactobacillus strains capable of producing peptides and other active metabolites that prevent the penetration of COVID-19 into human cells and decrease the severity and pathogenesis of this new coronavirus.

It is necessary to develop additional antioxidant and immunomodulatory pharmabiotics, postbiotics, and next-generation probiotic drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection. To create new generation pharmabiotics, and postbiotics, it is necessary to study the intestinal microbiome of stress-resistant people as a resource of biologically active compounds and strains of lactobacteria that ensure human resistance to coronavirus infection. After coronavirus infection and before vaccination, it is necessary to diagnose the state of the intestinal microbiome and normalize the disturbed state. To increase the effectiveness of protein vaccines against coronavirus infection, it is necessary to develop adjuvants based on lactobacteria and bifidobacteria capable of enhancing the cellular immune response.436

There are new prospects for the use of components of lactobacteria, rather than their use in living form cultures. Postbiotics are now defined as metabolites and cellular components that provide health benefits.32,447,448 Postbiotics are a promising area of research for future pharmaceuticals and functional foods with antioxidant properties for the treatment of depressive disorders.32,393 The potential of postbiotics can be used by packaging them into nanostructures, allowing them to be delivered to organs affected by inflammation.32,449 The use of extracellular vesicles of gram-positive probiotic bacteria, which can freely enter the bloodstream, as well as tissues and organs of the human body, is another interesting area of research.32,450,451 As a modern method, metagenomics is widely used not only to study differences in the composition of the microbiome in disease states in comparison with healthy people, but also to study the functional genes of the intestinal microbiome.32 For this reason, it is desirable to use metagenomic analysis of sequenced whole genome bacterial DNA to study the antioxidant potential of the intestinal microbiome. This approach can yield significant results in the search for target genes that are included in the catalog of reference genes of the search tool.32

Inflammatory processes of various organs and systems accompany many chronic and infectious human diseases. As a rule, they are accompanied by a violation of the composition and functions of the human intestinal microbiome, called dysbiosis of the intestinal tract. At the same time, inflammation and dysbiosis, having common indicators and mechanisms, are characterized by biomarkers characteristic of certain pathologies. The search for biomarkers of pathologies at the level of the microbiome and the human body is a step towards the practical diagnosis of the disease and the development of drugs. In the case of COVID-19 and Parkinson’s disease, the RAAS system is the common system involved in the pathogenesis of diseases properties.32 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ACE2 and its receptor are overlapping bio targets in SARS-CoV-2 and Parkinson’s disease. The RAAS system was discovered and described over 100 years ago. It was demonstrated that the RAAS is involved in the formation of oxidative stress and inflammatory processes in viral and neurodegenerative diseases, and the intestinal microbiome performs a protective function of the body. The participation of the RAAS system in the inflammatory processes of all human organs and systems, caused by Parkinson’s disease and COVID-19, has been shown. The involvement of the RAAS in complications after COVID-19 requires further research and detailed analysis. The apparent link between gut microbiome dysbiosis and COVID-19 and Parkinson’s disease requires the targeted creation of pharmabiotics and postbiotics to correct the microbiome. Using the antioxidant potential of lactobacteria is undoubtedly the right approach in the prevention of inflammatory diseases. Lactobacteria are promising candidates for anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drugs.32,452,453 The term pharmabiotics, which was first published about 15 years ago, better describes probiotic-based medicines.454, 455, 456, 457 The development of drugs aimed at eliminating the inflammation phenotype of the intestinal microbiome will be greatly facilitated if new methodological and conceptual approaches to the search for unique strains of probiotic bacteria are implemented; they include a comparative analysis of the genomes of lactobacteria, as well as metagenomes properties.32 Omics technologies have been used to study the intestinal microbiome of healthy people and patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. Characterization of the gut microbiome in health and disease is likely to become possible when the biomarkers of a dysfunctional microbiome are better understood. Efforts are being made to identify the genes responsible for the gut microbiome’s neuromodulatory and immunomodulatory properties.32 The development of projects for the study of unique strains of lactobacteria from new promising sources using omics technologies is considered a necessary task of modern health care properties.32
