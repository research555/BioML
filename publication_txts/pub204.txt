A snapshot of gut microbiota of an adult urban population from Western region of India

The human gut microbiome contributes to a broad range of biochemical and metabolic functions that directly or indirectly affect human physiology. Several recent studies have indicated that factors like age, geographical location, genetic makeup, and individual health status significantly influence the diversity, stability, and resilience of the gut microbiome. Of the mentioned factors, geographical location (and related dietary/socio-economic context) appears to explain a significant portion of microbiome variation observed in various previously conducted base-line studies on human gut microbiome. Given this context, we have undertaken a microbiome study with the objective of cataloguing the taxonomic diversity of gut microbiomes sampled from an urban cohort from Ahmedabad city in Western India. Computational analysis of microbiome sequence data corresponding to 160 stool samples (collected from 80 healthy individuals at two time-points, 60 days apart) has indicated a Prevotella-dominated microbial community. Given that the typical diet of participants included carbohydrate and fibre-rich components (predominantly whole grains and legume-based preparations), results appear to validate the proposed correlation between diet/geography and microbiome composition. Comparative analysis of obtained gut microbiome profiles with previously published microbiome profiles from US, China, Finland, and Japan additionally reveals a distinct taxonomic and (inferred) functional niche for the sampled microbiomes.

Recent advances in healthcare and medical research suggest that human beings are actually a composite organism, and most of the genetic information contained on/ within a living human body can be attributed to the billions of microbes residing on/ within it [1]. Consequently the health of any individual is dependent (at least to a certain extent) on the dynamics of various microbial communities (referred to as microbiomes) inhabiting a human body. Technological developments in the field of metagenomics have further revolutionized our understanding of the human microbiome in health and disease. For example, an aberrant or deviant gut microbiome (one of the most studied microbiomes) has been implicated in several diseases and physiological disorders like enteric infections [2,3], obesity [4,5], Crohn’s disease [6], Type II diabetes [4,5], colorectal cancer[7,8], etc. Interestingly, even nutritional and neurological disorders such as malnutrition[9,10], Parkinson's disease[11,12], schizophrenia[13], etc. are indicated to have a strong microbial basis. Study of different microbiomes, therefore, holds the promise of complementing our existing knowledge of human physiology, and paves the way for the development of new therapeutic approaches. Understanding the structure and function of microbiomes sampled from multiple subject cohorts is expected to provide important insights into the healthy commensal microflora, dysbiotic patterns related to onset of different disease/ disorders, disease susceptibility, impact of various types of co-infections, and on an optimistic note—in discovering (and/ or defining) alternate, novel, and improved diagnostic methods as well as therapeutic regimes[14].

The present study aims at filling this gap by performing a gut microbiome study with a cohort of 80 urbansubjects from Ahmedabad city in Western India (hereafter referred to as ‘Western India’ cohort). Besides helping in cataloguing the repertoire of gut microbes in Western Indian population, it is anticipated that the base-line data obtained in this study will enable in deciphering critical insights with respect to the correlation of the structure of the gut microbiome and various diseases/ metabolic disorders from a regional perspective. The cohort size (n = 80) taken in this study is reasonably large enough to facilitate comparison with datasets from other geographies, and for deciphering distinctive structural and functional aspects of the Western Indian Gut Microbiome. It may be noted that earlier studies [16,20] pertaining to region specific microbial community characteristics had more or less equivalent cohort sizes.

This study was conducted at Veeda Clinical Research, Ahmedabad, India. The protocol was approved by the Anveshhan Independent Ethics Committee (Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India) associated with the study centre. The study was conducted as per the pertinent requirements of the ICMR guidelines for Biomedical Research on Human Subjects, Good Clinical Practices for Clinical Research in India. The protocol was carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines, and was in agreement with Declaration of Helsinki principles. Prior to the start of the study, healthy, willing, volunteers from Ahmedabad city in Gujarat were individually provided with a subject informed consent document that provided complete information on the sampling procedure and the objectives of the study. Subjects reported to clinical facility for 1 and 60 days and provided ambulatory stool samples. All subjects were advised to consume a regular diet during the course of study. Screening data pertaining to enrolled subjects was captured on a paper format, and then collated in an excel sheet and verified.

A total of 80 subjects were enrolled in the study. The subjects were mainly from lower socio-economic background from Western part of India (Ahmedabad). Metadata information pertaining to various subjects is provided in S1 Table. It may be noted that the dietary habits of all 80 participants were more or less in line with local dietary habits and primarily comprised of fruits, vegetables, wheat, millet, sorghum, dairy products, sprouts, leafy vegetables, rice and pulses. Consumption of meat and fish is relatively lower as compared to other regions in India[21,22].

During subject selection, the following inclusion criteria were considered:

The exclusion criteria included:

Stool samples were collected preferably in the morning of scheduled visit at Veeda Clinical Research Pvt. Ltd. All subjects were instructed to visit the clinical facility for providing samples. Stool samples were collected in pre-labelled OMNIgene Gut (OMR 200) tubes procured from DNA Genotek, Canada. All the preparations and collection steps were followed as mentioned in the kit protocol. Transfer of the stool samples to the DNA extraction and sequencing facility was done as per recommendations and necessary precautions defined in protocol.

‘W’ represents a degenerate base.

Raw (paired-end) sequence data (in fastq format) was initially pre-processed to remove sequences of low quality (minimum mean phred score less than 25) and insufficient length (less than 100bp). The resulting fasta files were then provided as input to the V-Xtractor 2.0 program[23] for retaining the V3-V4 specific region in each sequence. Taxonomic profiles (S2 Table) corresponding to each sample were obtained using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier, version 2.11[24] executed using a bootstrap threshold of 80%. Rarefaction plot was generated using PAST software[25].

Core taxa were identified using the following approach. 80% of the samples constituting the dataset were drawn randomly. The taxon which has the highest Median Abundance (MA) in the drawn subset was identified. Taxa with abundance value at least 80% of the identified MA value in the previous step were retained as core taxa for that subset. The entire process was iterated around 1000 times. Taxa that were identified in at-least 80% of iterations were designated as ‘core’ for the respective dataset. The rigorous boot-strapped procedure stated above was adopted to ensure stringency while calling a given taxon as ‘core’ for a given dataset.

Shannon, Simpson and Chao were computed using functions implemented in the R-vegan package. Functional profiles at pathway and pathway-class levels (at various PEC levels) were obtained using Vikodak's Global Mapper Module[26].

Genera/ pathways/ pathway-classes with significantly different relative abundance between the three clusters were identified using the following bootstrapped approach–

The above steps were repeated 100 times to obtain 100 values of median abundances for each genera/ pathway/ pathway class in each cluster. Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (as implemented in 'pgirmess' R package) was then carried out between the obtained median abundance values (for each genera/ pathway/ pathway class) in each of the clusters classes, and genera/ pathways/ pathway classes with significantly different abundance were identified using Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) p-value correction at an FDR of 0.0001. The entire procedure described above was bootstrapped 100 times. Genera/ pathways/ pathway classes which were observed as having a significantly different abundance (post BH correction) in at least 99% of iterations were retained.

To assess core taxonomic characteristics of gut microbiomes(sampled in the present study), taxonomic profiles of 160 samples (comprised of approximately 25 million high-quality sequences) taken from 80 (apparently healthy) Western Indian individuals at two time points 60 days apart (hereafter referred to as WIGM-T1 and WIGM-T60) were obtained. Rarefaction plot (S1 Fig) indicated that, for most samples the curves did level off. Only for a small subset of samples, they did not reach an ideal asymptote. However, Good’s coverage of >97% obtained for all samples, indicates adequate sequencing coverage.

Analysis of taxonomic profiles indicates that the Western Indian Gut Microbiome is dominated by microbes belonging to four phyla, viz. Bacteroidetes (median abundance 71.5%), Firmicutes (18.7%), Proteobacteria (3.8%), and Actinobacteria (0.6%). In other words, approximately 95% of sequences are observed to be assigned to microbes belonging to these four phyla (the remaining 5% being assigned to 16 other phyla in miniscule proportions). At the genus level, 78 unique genera (90% of them common to both time points) are observed to have non-zero median abundance. Greater than 80% of the sequences are assigned to 5 genera viz. Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, Alloprevotella, Roseburia, and Bacteroides. Fig 1 depicts the abundance pattern of major genera and their corresponding phyla (as inset) in the Western Indian population. In summary, the taxonomic profiles corresponding to the Western Indian gut microbiome indicate a Prevotella-dominated community that closely resembles (a) the profiles obtained in an earlier Indian microbiome study(19), and (b) the taxonomic composition of gut microbiome samples clustered as 'Enterotype II' (as described in Arumugam et al., 2011[27]). Dietary habits prevalent in the Indian subcontinent (and particularly that prevalent in Ahmedabad, the geographic location of the recruited 80 participants) lend credence to this result. The typical diet of participants in the present study included simple and complex carbohydrates (i.e. rice, wheat, sorghum and millet) and fibre-rich components (i.e. fruits, vegetables, whole grains, sprouts, etc.)[21,22]. It may further be noted that previous studies [28,29] had also indicated gut microbiota to be enriched with Prevotella in individuals who consumed fibre-rich foods (as was the typical diet of individuals of the present study).

Analysis further indicates the presence of phylum Actinobacteria, a few members of which are known for their beneficial probiotic effects. In particular, members of genus Bifidobacterium are observed to be present in the analysed taxonomic profiles, albeit in minor proportions. Species belonging to Bifidobacterium are especially known for their role in the breakdown of metabolic by-products which are generated as a result of partial digestion of complex dietary carbohydrates [35].

In order to investigate community-level relationships between various genera constituting the Western Indian Gut microbiome, correlation analysis was performed for identifying genera-pairs having significant positive or negative correlations (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value < 0.1) between their patterns of abundance. The procedure was independently performed on WIGM-T1 and WIGM-T60. Results of these experiments (graphically depicted in Fig 2) indicate a negative correlation between Prevotella and (a significant subset of) other bacterial species constituting the microbial community. A cluster of bacterial species comprising of Dorea, Blautia, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, Bacteroides, Paraprevotella, Faecalibacterium, and Collinsella are observed to have positive correlation between their patterns of abundances. Given that these correlations are observed at both time-points, the confidence attributed to these (computed) pair-wise correlations (between the stated genera) can be considered to be on the higher side. It is important to note that these bacterial genera are known players in fermentation of complex carbohydrates (obtained through breakdown of dietary fibre), and significantly involve, as metabolic substrates/ by-products, short chain fatty acids (butyrate, proprionate, etc.) which are known to boost the immune system through induction of regulatory T-cells in the gut[36,37]. It may be noted that short chain fatty acids and hydrogen, typical end-products of metabolism of complex carbohydrates, have well-established clinical benefits[38,39].

Principal Coordinate Analysis i.e. PCoA (using Jensen-Shannon divergence as a distance metric) was performed for comparing the taxonomic profiles in the Western Indian gut (obtained in the present study) with those obtained (from apparently healthy participants) in other geographies, viz. Japan, China, USA, and Finland[12,19,40–43]. S3 Table provides details of various studies from which these datasets were sourced. Results of this ordination analysis (depicted in Fig 3) indicate optimal grouping of microbiome sample profiles into two distinct clusters. Although, majority of non-Indian samples segregate into a distinct cluster (hereafter referred to as cluster 1), samples from Japan (in Cluster 1) appear to be spatially separated with respect to samples from other geographies in the same cluster. To confirm this observation, PCoA clustering was repeated using only the set of samples that were tagged to Cluster 1. The Calinski–Harabasz (CH) Index, a metric employed for inferring the statistically optimal number of clusters, obtained during this experiment (inset within Fig 4) indicates that samples in cluster 1 can be grouped optimally into either 2 or 4 clusters, the CH-Index value being almost similar for both cluster sizes. Fig 4 and S2 Fig depict the results of sub-clustering samples in cluster 1 into two and four groups, respectively. The two observations which are clearly evident from results in these figures are as follows. Irrespective of sub-clustering into two or four groups, the Japanese samples are observed to form a distinct sub-cluster with clear spatial segregation (of Japanese samples) with respect to samples belonging to China, US, and Finland. Samples of the latter three countries, however, do not clearly segregate as per their country of origin, suggesting a high level of similarity between their microbiome profiles. In contrast to results obtained by sub-clustering of samples in cluster 1, performing sub-clustering of samples in cluster 2 (which distinctly harboured >85% of Western Indian samples) indicates formation of 2 sub-clusters, with a CH-Index value of 2 being identified as most optimal (inset within Fig 5). However, in spite of sub-clustering, it is observed that samples in cluster 2 do not segregate/ sub-group in terms of sampling time-point (S3 Fig). Given these observations, overall three clusters, viz. the two sub-clusters (hereafter referred to as 1a and 1b) obtained from samples in cluster 1 (using a CH-Index value of 2) and cluster 2 (in its entirety) were considered for further comparative analysis.

A rigorous boot-strapped method (a variant of the method described earlier[44]) was employed to identify, in each of the three clusters being compared, bacterial taxa that can be considered as 'core'. In brief, for each cluster being analysed, the identified 'core taxa' are those that are consistently present with a minimum threshold of abundance across various samples in that cluster. While Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Roseburia are observed to constitute the core in cluster 1a, seven bacterial genera emerge as the core taxa in samples belonging to cluster 1b. These taxa included Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Dorea, Lachnospiraceaincertaesedis, and Streptococcus. In contrast, only two genera, namely, Prevotella and Faecalibacterium are identified as core in cluster 2 (S4 Fig). These results are consistent with those obtained by (a) performing a principal component analysis (PCA) of abundance pattern of taxa identified in various samples constituting all three clusters (Fig 6), (b) comparing the abundance pattern of the ten-most abundant genera and phyla in the three clusters (S5 and S6 Figs), and (c) employing Kruskal Wallis rank-sum test (coupled to a rigorous bootstrapped approach) for identifying genera whose abundance pattern is significantly different between the three clusters (Table 1). As seen in Fig 6, PCA analysis indicates Bacteroides and Prevotella as entities that drive/ define the separation of samples in clusters 1a and 2 respectively. Other core genera identified for cluster 1b are also consistent with results obtained in PCA analysis. The ratio of taxa belonging to phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes appears to be a clear differentiator between the taxonomic profiles generated from various samples in each cluster (S5 and S6 Figs). Kruskal Wallis rank-sum test (with Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-values < 0.001 at a False Discovery Rate of 0.0001) identified 80 genera as differentiators between the three clusters. Out of these, 21 genera (listed in Table 1) have a median percentage abundance of greater than equal to 0.2% in (samples belonging to) at least one of the clusters. Results in Table 1 appear to be in sync with results described earlier.

List of bacterial genera identified as having (significantly) different abundance between Cluster-1a, Cluster-1b and Cluster-2. These bacterial genera were identified using Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (with Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-values < 0.001 at a False Discovery Rate of 0.0001) coupled with a bootstrap approach (details in methods). Significantly different genera with median percentage abundance > = 0.2% in at least one of the three clusters are reported in the table. Numerals in blue represent the highest median abundance across the three clusters.

Employing various diversity metrics for inferring the structural aspects (viz. richness, diversity, and evenness) of the microbial community (in each of the three clusters) indicated the following interesting patterns. Analysis of various samples in the three clusters indicates that Western Indian microbiome samples (most of which are grouped in cluster 2) have significantly higher Chao values (a measure of richness) as compared to samples belonging to clusters 1a and 1b (Fig 7). However, values of Shannon index (a measure of diversity) and Simpson index (a measure of evenness) are significantly lower than that obtained with samples from other geographies (clusters 1a and 1b), indicating a biased community structure dominated by a few bacterial genera.

The functional potential of samples in each individual cluster was computationally inferred using Vikodak's Global Mapper module[26]. The (inferred) abundances of various pathways as well as pathway-classes predicted at 'pathway exclusion cut-off' (PEC) values of 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 were subjected to Kruskal Wallis rank-sum test (with Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-values < 0.001 at a False Discovery Rate of 0.0001) to identify significant differentiators between the three clusters. It may be noted that a PEC represents the threshold value (w. r. t. the proportion of constituent genes/ enzymes) that is used for inferring/ reporting a pathway (or pathway-class) to be present/ functional in the given sample. S4 Table and Table 2 list pathways and pathway classes that are found not only significantly differentiating buthad (predicted) non-zero median abundance values in at least one of the three clusters.

List of differentially abundant pathway-classes (identified between Cluster-1a, Cluster-1b and Cluster-2). Significantly different pathway classes were identified using Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (with Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-values < 0.001 at a False Discovery Rate of 0.0001) coupled with a bootstrap approach. Pathway-classes with significantly different median abundances in at least 99% of iterations are shown in this table. The last column titled ‘Vikodak Pathway Exclusion Cut-off (PEC) threshold’ indicates the PEC value thresholds at which the pathway-class was reported by Vikodak. Green indicates presence and red indicates absence.

Results in Table 2 and S4 Table indicate the following noticeable differences between the functional potential encoded by microbiomes belonging to each of the three compared clusters. The median abundance of the pathway class 'carbohydrate metabolism' is observed to be significantly higher for cluster 2 which overwhelmingly harbours samples from Indian subjects (Table 2). The pathway corresponding to 'Starch and sucrose metabolism' (belonging to pathway class 'carbohydrate metabolism') is also observed to be a distinct differentiator between the functional potential of the three clusters. Similarly, a number of metabolic pathways corresponding to pathway-classes 'glycan biosynthesis' and 'lipid metabolism' are observed to be over-represented in the microbiomes of cluster 1b (which are predominated by Japanese samples). In summary, the median abundances of the predicted pathways and pathway classes (emerging as significantly differentiating between the three clusters) appear to have a pattern of distinct functional divergence that grossly corresponds to dietary habits associated to geographies that each cluster represents.

Microbial consortia colonize various sites of the human body. The microbiome (i.e. the collective genetic repertoire of microbial consortia/ community inhabiting various human body sites) not only help in enriching our own functional potential, but also play a key role in our physiology, development, nutritional status, health, and immunity. Recent studies, which have deciphered various taxonomic and functional aspects pertaining to human gut microbiomes sampled across various geographies, indicate interesting associations between (geography-specific) dietary patterns and the composition of the gut microbiome sampled from subjects in specific geographies[15–19]. The present study attempts to expand the horizon of existing gut microbiome studies (aimed at cataloguing the repertoire of gut microbes) to the Western Indian geography. A reasonably participant cohort, comprising of 80 individuals residing within the geographical limits of the same city i.e. Ahmedabad, was recruited in the present study. Moreover, samples were taken from each participant at two time points (60 days apart). This study design ensured two aspects. As a country, India, with its large geographical spread, has significant variations with respect to dietary habits as well as climatic conditions[21,22] Given that objective of the present study was to establish base-line data that comprehensively represents at least one of the various dietary preferences prevalent in India, the selection of a subject cohort was restricted to a single region i.e. Western India (particularly the city of Ahmedabad). Obtaining samples at two time points was done with the objective of studying the dynamics and stability aspects of human gut microbiomes within the same individual. A comparison of microbiome samples obtained from the same individuals at two time points indicated no significant alteration of microbiome community structure over time (Fig 1). Results of ordination analysis also indicates grouping of samples from both time-points into the same cluster i.e. cluster 2 (Figs
3 and
5). Results of (further) sub-clustering of samples in cluster 2 also indicate the high level of similarity of samples obtained at both time points (S3 Fig). Further studies will however be required to explore the vast heterogeneity of gut microbial communities within individuals from various parts of India.

Although comparative analysis of microbiome samples (spanning 5 geographies) performed in this study (S3 Table) indicate some extent of correlation of microbiome profiles with dietary preferences prevalent in specific geographies, it is likely that apart from diet, several other factors play a role in shaping of the gut microbiome.Further studies will be required to assert this correlation.
