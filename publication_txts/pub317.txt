Gut, oral and skin microbiome of Indian patrilineal families reveal perceptible association with age

The human microbiome plays a key role in maintaining host homeostasis and is influenced by age, geography, diet, and other factors. Traditionally, India has an established convention of extended family arrangements wherein three or more generations, bound by genetic relatedness, stay in the same household. In the present study, we have utilized this unique family arrangement to understand the association of age with the microbiome. We characterized stool, oral and skin microbiome of 54 healthy individuals from six joint families by 16S rRNA gene-based metagenomics. In total, 69 (1.03%), 293 (2.68%) and 190 (8.66%) differentially abundant OTUs were detected across three generations in the gut, skin and oral microbiome, respectively. Age-associated changes in the gut and oral microbiome of patrilineal families showed positive correlations in the abundance of phyla Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria, respectively. Genera Treponema and Fusobacterium showed a positive correlation with age while Granulicatella and Streptococcus showed a negative correlation with age in the oral microbiome. Members of genus Prevotella illustrated high abundance and prevalence as a core OTUs in the gut and oral microbiome. In conclusion, this study highlights that precise and perceptible association of age with microbiome can be drawn when other causal factors are kept constant.

Aging is an extremely complex, perpetual, progressive and multifactorial process resulting in decreased physiologic functions of all the organ systems1. Studies have reported that the human microbiome, the latest discovered organ, is also significantly influenced by increasing age2–4. Studies have suggested that the complex and diverse communities of microbes that inhabit the gut vary through different stages of an individual’s life5. Many of these alterations are harmless and natural, while some of the alterations can have an important effect on overall homeostasis6. Importantly, notable changes in the human microbiome occur when the immune system is relatively weak, i.e., at the start of life and during aged life7. Many of the fluctuations in the microbiome are harmless and natural; nonetheless, studies have shown that some disturbances in the gut microbiome can have important effects on health and disease6. Earlier studies on human microbiome analyses have discovered an increased abundance of Bacteroides species in the elderly population8. An enriched abundance of Proteobacteria a bacterial group containing ‘pathobionts’ known for causing impairment in a susceptible host, i.e., in centenarian’s2–4. But the populations used for these studies were either from different geographical locations or with different diets2–4. In agreement with the studies on the human gut microbiome, in older micro-pigs9 also decreased abundance of beneficial microbes including probiotic bacteria and short-chain fatty acid-producers was recorded while Bacteroides were increased with the increasing age9.

In the present study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the human microbiome from the gut, oral and skin ecosystems from 54 healthy subjects belonging to six different patrilineally related three generation families staying together in rural Indian settings. The study population has harmonized dietary, social habits, hygiene and sanitation habits, economic status and geographic position. Predominantly, other microbiome contributing factors were harmonized and age was the only distinguishing factor. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing-based microbiome analysis performed to investigate the age-related changes in the gut, skin and oral microbiome of Endogamous Agriculturist Indian (EAI) sub-population.

Overall, a total of 9,566,497 sequences were generated, out of which 8,048,975 (File S1) were taxonomically assigned, resulting in 6,708 OTUs for the gut microbiome. Four samples (St.D1004, St.D301, St.S610 and St.S612) were removed from further analysis due to lower sequencing depth. Bacterial phyla such as Bacteroidetes (49.3%), Firmicutes (41.6%), Proteobacteria (5.7%), Actinobacteria (2.18%) and Tenericutes (0.4%) were highly dominant and constituted ~99% of the total gut microbiome. Presence of 174 different bacterial genera was noted, wherein Prevotella (50%), Dialister (12%), Bacteroides (9%), Megamonas (3%), and Succinivibrio (3%) were among the dominant taxa contributing to a total of 77% of the gut microbiome (Fig. S1a). Although, genus Prevotella was observed to have varying relative abundance ranging from 2% to 77% across the study population, its dominance was evident from the fact that 62% (n = 31) of the study subjects had an abundance in a range of 33% to 77% of the total gut microbiome (Table S1).

The skin microbiome data comprised of 10,951,175 good quality sequences (File S1) clustered into 10,920 OTUs. Skin microbiome analysis showed a higher abundance of phyla Firmicutes (49%), Proteobacteria (26%), Actinobacteria (12%) and Bacteroidetes (8%) collectively on 11 different body sites including dry, moist and sebaceous regions. Only one percent of OTUs were assigned to phylum Cyanobacteria. The skin microbiome showed the highest number of OTUs (n = 10,920) compared to oral and stool samples. Corynebacterium (10%) Alloiococcus (9%), Staphylococcus (8%), Streptococcus (7%) and Anaerococcus (6%) were the most dominant and diverse bacterial genera detected in the skin microbiome (Fig. S1c). Alpha diversity analysis measures, i.e., observed species (OTUs), Chao1, Shannon and Inverse Simpson revealed no significant differences in the gut and skin microbiome when compared between the three age groups (Fig. 1), family structure and dietary habits (Table 1). However, significant differences were observed in the oral microbiome between the age groups (ANOVA, p < 0.05 with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR corrections) (see Fig. 1B).

Bacterial genera prevalent in 95% of the study population with more than 0.1% abundance were considered as a part of the core microbiome. Estimation of core microbiome was performed for individual families (n = 6 families) and the overall EAI study population. Amongst the 171 total bacterial genera detected in the gut microbiome, only three genera, namely Prevotella, Ruminococcus and Faecalibacterium, were recorded as a part of core microbiome across all the families (Fig. 2a, Table S3). These core taxa represented 23% to 91% gut microbiome composition of the participants (Fig. S2). With the aforementioned detection threshold few bacterial genera were explicitly detected in particular family as core taxa wherein, Parabacteroides was detected in family D3, Haemophilus and Roseburia in family D8, Streptococcus and Dorea in family D10 (Fig. S3, Table S3).

In the skin microbiome samples, Corynebacterium and Streptococcus were the only bacterial genera detected as core taxa across all the families (Fig. 2c, Table S5). Similar to the gut microbiome, family-specific bacterial genera were also detected in the skin microbiome. These genera include Novosphingobium in family D8, Enhydrobacter, Salinicoccus and Butyrivibrio in family D10, and Haemophilus and Gemella in family S6 (Fig. S5, Table S5). These core taxa represented 37% to 94% of the total microbiome (Fig. S2). Largely, the contribution of core taxa in the gut, oral and skin microbiome of all the patrilineal families was identical.

Detailed dietary information of the study population was collected using the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). With the help of a nutritionist, the dietary information was subsequently converted into the daily intake of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, lipids, fibers and calories (Table S6). Investigation revealed that average carbohydrates consumption in the first, second and third-generation members was 166, 396 and 339 grams, providing 74%, 81% and 80% of daily calories in the respective generations. Overall the type and amount of dietary components were similar across the population, except for family D3, which has relatively lesser consumption of these components. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) based on the abundance of bacterial genera, amount of dietary components and samples metadata showed that all the samples were scattered across the ordination plot and no clear clustering of the samples was observed based on age group or gender (Fig. 3). The variation explained by the ordination plot was also non-significant, reporting 7.5% for the gut, 10.6% for the oral and 6.9% for the skin microbiome (Fig. 3). Also, correlation analysis between the relative abundance of bacterial taxa and routine consumption of dietary components showed no significant association (Fig. 4).

Microbiome community structure of gut, oral and skin samples was investigated across three generations (age groups). Amongst the prevalent bacterial genera of the gut microbiome, Succinivibrio and Ruminococcus were highly abundant in the age group 1, Dialister, Megamonas, Phascolarctobacterium, Megasphaera and Faecalibacterium in the age group 2 and Prevotella, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium were in the age group 3 (Table S7a). Likewise, in the oral microbiome Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Veillonella, Capnocytophaga, Rothia and Aggregatibacter were highly abundant in the age group 1, genus Haemophilus in age group 2 while Neisseria, Streptococcus, Porphyromonas and Granulicatella in the age group 3 (Table S7b). High abundance of few bacterial taxa was recorded in particular age groups in the skin microbiome samples also, wherein Corynebacterium, Alloiococcus, Peptoniphilus, Haemophilus, Acinetobacter and Clostridium were highly abundant in age group 1, Anaerococcus, Porphyromonas and Campylobacter in age group 2 and Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Novosphingobium, Paracoccus, Moraxella and Prevotella in age group 3 (Table S7c). Primarily, age-associated changes were observed in the microbiome structure of three-generation members and to strengthen these observations; statistical analysis was also completed. Comparative microbiome analysis in three age groups showed no significant differential abundance of bacterial genera in the gut and skin microbiome. However, the oral microbiome showed significant variations in the abundance of genera Dialister, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, Selenomonas, Filifactor and Treponema (Fig. 5D) (ANOVA, p < 0.05 with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR corrections). We confirmed our observations using qPCR analysis for quantifying the absolute proportion of genus Prevotella in the total human gut bacteria (Fig. 5E).

Amidst the total 171 bacterial genera in the gut microbiome, only genus Bacteroides showed age-associated changes. Decreased abundance Bacteroides was recorded with the increasing age (nonparametric Spearman correlation (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6B). Whereas, in the oral microbiome of the population, bacterial genera Treponema and Fusobacterium showed a positive correlation (Fig. 6D,E) while genera Granulicatella and Streptococcus showed a negative correlation with the age (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6F,G). However, in the skin microbiome, no such statistically significant correlations were noted.

Indian patrilineal extended family structure provides a unique opportunity to study the underlying effects of age, diet, and genetics influencing the human microbiome. Such family structure is a widely seen residential unit comprising of 2–4 patrilineally related generations living together, particularly in rural and semi-urban settings29,30. In the present study, we analyzed gut, oral and skin microbiome from 54 healthy subjects belonging to six different families from a single biogeographic region (Dongargaon: 18.6199° N, 74.0807° E and Shikrapur: 18.6924° N, 74.1323° E).

In conclusion, this study particularly highlights the precise and perceptible association of age with the microbiome. Our finding suggests that the age-related changes are very specific and bacterial phylum Proteobacteria needs to be investigated in detail to understand its specific physiological role in gut microbiome. Similarly, bacterial taxa, including Treponema, Fusobacterium, Granulicatella and Streptococcus the member of the human oral microbiome, can be explored for their importance in the oral microbiome. Also, the findings suggest that core taxa constitute more than 75% of the gut and oral microbiome, while only 67% of the skin microbiome, indicating a larger variability of the microbiome present on the skin. We present baseline data of the human microbiome from a healthy Indian sub-population, which could be used as a reference for further studies, including diabetes75–77 obesity and inflammatory diseases.

The study was approved by the ethics committees of the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune and King Edward’s Memorial Hospital Research Centre (KEMHRC), Pune. Written informed consent from the study subjects or their parents wherever applicable were taken, as per the guidelines of the institutional ethics committee and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), India. We confirm that all the experiments were performed as per the approved guidelines.

Subjects were recruited from the Vadu Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Vadu HDSS) area of the Vadu Rural Health Program, KEM Hospital Research Centre, Pune (VRHP, KEMHRC, Pune). The Vadu study population comprises of about 170,000 individuals that reside in 22 villages. The objective of Vadu HDSS is to create a longitudinal database of demographic information, including fertility, mortality, migration and marital status, of the Vadu area. Two villages, namely Dongargaon (Latitude: 18.7442326, Longitude: 73.4504317) and Shikrapur (Latitude: 18.687639, Longitude: 74.125671) were selected out of the total Vadu HDSS region.

Among the 30 families screened, six families comprising of 54 individuals fulfilled the required criteria and were included in the study.

A Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), along with 48 hrs dietary recall was administered before sample collection. Detailed information on the consumption of the food item and quantity for each meal of the day were recorded. With the help of nutritionists, this information then translated into the daily consumption of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, fibers and calories. Additional metadata about the use of antibiotics and medicines, hygiene and sanitary practices, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, social habits, health and diseases (self-reported with or without medical records based on standard questionnaire) and other demographic characteristics were recorded. Separate health status questionnaires for adults and children were administered for the selection of healthy adults for the study (Tables S8 and S9).

Gut, oral, and skin samples from the recruited subjects were collected in triplicates (with an interval of one week). Freshly voided, early morning fecal sample was collected in a sterile container. Early morning oral washing (before brushing or gargling) was collected using freshly prepared sterile 1X PBS (pH 7.4) in a sterile container. Skin samples from 11 different body sites per individual (belonging to three different regions, i.e., moist, oily and sebaceous region) were collected as described in Fig. S7. All samples were stored at −80 °C until further processing.

DNA extraction from fecal (representative of the gut), oral and skin samples was done using QIAamp stool DNA mini kit, QIAamp DNA mini kit, and QIAamp blood and tissue DNA extraction kit, respectively (Qiagen, USA). The DNA extraction was performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction with the inclusion of bead beating and freeze-thaw treatment at −80 °C and 90 °C for 10 minutes alternatively. Metagenomic sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was done using Illumina Miseq platform, paired-end (2 × 300 bp) sequencing, as described earlier78.

Assembly of paired-end reads for each sample was carried out using FLASH (Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads). Low-quality sequences were removed during the assembly with low overlapping regions (less than 20 nucleotides)79. Microbial diversity analysis was done using standard QIIME (v1.8.0) pipeline80. Closed reference-based OTU picking approach was used to cluster reads into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at 97% sequence similarity using UCLUST algorithm81 and Greengenes database (13.8) and representative sequences from each OTU were selected for taxonomic assignment. Beta diversity and other statistical analysis was performed using Phyloseq82, corrplot83, vegan84 and Microbiome85 packages in R. Additional statistical analysis were performed using STAMP86 and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). A web-based tool InteractiVenn was used for the analysis of shared and unique bacterial genera87.

Quantitation of genus Prevotella and total bacteria from fecal samples was carried out using qPCR as described previously88. Briefly, for quantifying 16S rRNA gene for total bacteria and Prevotella, 10 μl reactions in triplicate were set containing a suitable pair of primers88 (Table 2), 50 ng of Metagenomic DNA and SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems Inc. USA), using 7300 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems Inc. USA). Following PCR conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 1 min was used. Group-specific standard curves were generated from serial dilutions of a known concentration of respective PCR products. Additionally, melting curve analysis was performed at the end of qPCR cycles to check the amplification specificity. Average values of the triplicate were used for enumerations of tested gene copy numbers for each group using standard curves.
