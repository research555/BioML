Glucocorticoids coordinate changes in gut microbiome composition in wild North American red squirrels

The gut microbiome impacts host health and fitness, in part through the diversification of gut metabolic function and pathogen protection. Elevations in glucocorticoids (GCs) appear to reduce gut microbiome diversity in experimental studies, suggesting that a loss of microbial diversity may be a negative consequence of increased GCs. However, given that ecological factors like food availability and population density may independently influence both GCs and microbial diversity, understanding how these factors structure the GC-microbiome relationship is crucial to interpreting its significance in wild populations. Here, we used an ecological framework to investigate the relationship between GCs and gut microbiome diversity in wild North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). As expected, higher GCs predicted lower gut microbiome diversity and an increase in metabolic taxa. Surprisingly, but in line with prior empirical studies on wild animals, gastrointestinal pathogens decreased as GCs increased. Both dietary heterogeneity and an upcoming food pulse exhibited direct effects on gut microbiome diversity, whereas conspecific density and reproductive activity impacted diversity indirectly via changes in host GCs. Our results provide evidence of a gut–brain axis in wild red squirrels and highlight the importance of situating the GC-gut microbiome relationship within an ecological framework.

The intimate symbiosis between animals and their microbiomes has become a major area of focus for animal behavior, ecology, and evolution research over the last decade. In vertebrates, the gut microbiome interacts strongly with other host physiological systems1. Gut microbiota are sensitive to changes in host immune function2, brain development and behavior3,4, circadian rhythms5, and metabolism6. Beyond these effects, the gut microbiome also responds to the host endocrine system. In wild female primates, reproductive hormones like estrogen and progesterone are associated with differences in gut microbiome composition7,8. In humans, both androgens and estrogens, as well as metabolic hormones like insulin, are linked to variation in gut microbiota9,10. Such connections reflect a larger “gut–brain axis” through which the gut microbiota and nervous system communicate11.

We predicted to find an overall negative association between host GCs and gut microbiome alpha diversity, along with an increase in pathogenic taxa and taxa involved in host metabolism with increasing GCs. Similar to prior studies in wild animals (Table
1), we focused here on the unidirectional effects of GCs on microbial diversity to understand gut–brain axis function in the absence of an experimental manipulation, and because previously documented sensitivity of GCs to intrinsic and extrinsic factors in our population28 suggests it may mediate downstream effects on the microbiome. We used a multivariate structural equation modeling approach43,44 to integrate GCs, the gut microbiome, and exogenous ecological and host biological variables into a single causal network45. We tested a set of a priori hypothesized relationships related to the direct and indirect effects of dietary heterogeneity, an upcoming spruce mast, and conspecific density on both GCs and gut microbiome diversity (Fig. S1). We expected to find that dietary heterogeneity and an upcoming spruce mast would have direct positive effects on gut microbiome diversity. Conversely, we predicted that density would have an indirect negative effect on diversity by way of GC elevations. We additionally included biological factors (reproductive activity, sex, age) in our analysis, given their potential effects on GCs and microbiome composition46–48. We predicted that reproductive activity had positive direct effects on both GCs and gut microbiome diversity, as a result of increased energetic demands49,50 and conspecific interactions, respectively. We also expected that older age would predict lower microbiome diversity, and that males would exhibit greater microbiome diversity due to travel across territories for multiple mating in the breeding season51.

Both gut microbiome alpha diversity and GCs were highly variable across seasons in each of our sampling years, with gut microbial diversity reaching its maxima during the summer months of July and August (Fig. 2A), coinciding with increased dietary diversity34,52. GCs were highest in early spring (March), with the exception of the mast year of 2010 in which GCs steadily increased across the first part of the year (Fig. 2A). Consistent with our predictions and in line with prior studies in which GCs were experimentally manipulated (Table
1), GCs were negatively associated with gut microbiome alpha diversity. Individuals with greater GC concentrations exhibited relatively lower taxonomic diversity (i.e., species richness, Chao1: β = − 75.05 ± 25.91, t = − 2.90, P = 0.004; Fig. 2B). Greater GCs were also associated with lower Shannon Indices, a composite measure of species richness and evenness (Shannon: β = − 77.64 ± 36.00, t = − 2.16, P = 0.03, Fig. 2C), as well as lower phylogenetic diversity in the gut microbial community (Faith’s PD: β = − 66.97 ± 26.71, t = − 2.51, P = 0.01, Fig. 2D). The negative relationship between GCs and gut microbiome alpha diversity was robust to individual variation in GC production, with higher individually-averaged GCs similarly predicting lower species richness (β ± SE: − 0.027 ± 0.011, t = − 2.45, P = 0.02).

We constructed a series of negative binomial linear mixed-effects models to determine how reduced gut microbiome alpha diversity was reflected in changes at the taxonomic level and identify taxa whose relative abundances changed with increasing GCs. We found that elevated GCs were associated with changes in gut microbiome composition at both the family (Fig. 3A) and genus (Fig. 3B) levels. Increased GCs predicted shifts in the relative abundances of 15 bacterial families, predominantly decreases in rare bacterial families (i.e., taxa that contribute < 0.01% relative abundance to the microbial community) (Fig. 3A; Table S1). An exception was a reduction in Elusimicrobiaceae, which contributed an average of 0.13% relative abundance to the gut microbiome community (β = − 0.81, PFDR < 0.0001). By contrast, elevated GCs were associated with an increase in Coriobacteriaceae (β = 0.57, PFDR = 0.007), Streptococcaceae (β = 1.0, PFDR < 0.0001), Dermabacteraceae (β = 2.81, PFDR < 0.0001), and Ruminococcaceae (β = 0.12, PFDR = 0.02) (Fig. 3A). Ruminococcaceae, a family of largely cellulolytic and fibrolytic bacteria, is an abundant (~ 25% relative abundance) and core taxa in the red squirrel gut microbiome52.

At the genus level, the relative abundances of 22 bacterial genera were significantly reduced with increasing host GCs. Similar to changes at the family level, the majority of bacterial genera reductions were rare taxa (Fig. 3B) with the exception of Brochothrix (mean 0.02% relative abundance). Contrary to our predictions but in line with a prior study on birds24, we found that two potentially pathogenic genera—Yersinia (β = − 1.09, PFDR = 0.004)53 and Salmonella (β = − 10.98, PFDR < 0.0001)54—decreased in relative abundance with increasing host GCs. Conversely, a greater proportion of abundant taxa were found to increase with increasing GCs (Fig. 3B). Greater host GCs predicted greater relative abundances of Clostridium (β = 0.28, PFDR = 0.008), Butyricicoccus (β = 0.35, PFDR = 0.004), Oscillospira (β = 0.60, PFDR < 0.0001), YRC22 (β = 0.65, PFDR = 0.004), and Lachnospira (β = 0.67, PFDR = 0.02).

To determine how ecological and host factors contributed to the effects of GCs on gut microbiome alpha diversity, we fit a structural equation model (SEM) based on a set of a priori hypothesized pathways (Fig. S1). The SEM was constructed to test the relative direct and indirect effects of three ecological factors (dietary heterogeneity, an upcoming spruce mast, and conspecific density) and three host factors (reproductive activity, age, and sex) on GCs and gut microbiome diversity. Overall, the SEM revealed direct and indirect pathways by which ecological and host factors exert cascading effects on microbial diversity (Figure 4). In line with our predictions, dietary heterogeneity and the presence of an upcoming spruce mast both exhibited direct effects on gut microbiome diversity, such that a more heterogeneous diet (standardized β = 0.26, P < 0.001) and an upcoming spruce masting event (standardized β = 0.71, P < 0.001) led to greater microbial diversity. Tests of directed separation revealed that there was no effect of either dietary heterogeneity or an upcoming spruce mast on host GCs. By contrast, conspecific density and reproductive activity indirectly, but not directly, affected gut microbiome diversity via changes to host GCs. Higher squirrel densities (standardized β = 0.26, P = 0.006) and reproductive activity (standardized β = 0.47, P < 0.001) predicted greater GC concentrations, which in turn reduced microbial diversity (standardized β = − 0.18, P = 0.01). There was no effect of age or sex on gut microbiome diversity, and tests of directed separation similarly found no effect of age or sex on host GCs.

Determining if ecological factors structure the relationship between glucocorticoids (GCs) and gut microbiome alpha diversity is crucial to interpreting the adaptive value of the GC-microbiome connection in wild animals. Here, we demonstrate that the link between GCs and gut microbiome alpha diversity is robust to ecological factors that directly influence the gut microbiome in wild populations. Our findings additionally suggest that GCs can integrate changes in ecology and host biology to induce plasticity in the gut microbiome.

Of note is the bidirectionality of the gut–brain axis demonstrated in laboratory rodent studies82,83, and thus the potential bidirectionality of the GC-microbiome relationship in wild animals. Here, we focused on the unidirectional effects of GCs on gut microbiome diversity similar to prior studies (Table
1). However, gut microbiota can themselves regulate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, such that shifts in gut microbiome composition may directly modulate host production of GCs84 and contribute to a feedback loop between the two systems85. Statistical constraints inherent to structural equation modeling prevented us from incorporating a bidirectional relationship between GCs and microbial diversity into this study69. Nonetheless, the bidirectionality of the gut–brain axis has important implications for the evolution of the relationship between GCs and microbial diversity in wild mammals11. We encourage future research on wild populations to implement experimental frameworks whenever possible to better characterize the complexity of the GC-gut microbiome relationship.

All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. All research methods and protocols were conducted under animal ethics approvals from Michigan State University (AUF#04/08-046-00), University of Guelph (AUP#09R006), and University of Michigan (PRO00005866). All authors complied with the ARRIVE guidelines.

Subjects for this study were wild North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) inhabiting a natural environment in southwest Yukon, Canada (61° N, 138° W). All subjects were continuously monitored as part of the Kluane Red Squirrel Project, a long-term field study that has been conducting a combination of live-trapping, focal behavioral observations, sampling, and experimental manipulations in the area since 198738,86. Individual squirrels are marked with small metal ear tags and unique combinations of colored wire threaded through the ear tags. Individuals are monitored from birth to death in each year of study, roughly from March to October, using live-trapping and behavioral observations38. Individuals included in our study lived on one of three grids (Agnes or AG, Kloo or KL, Sulphur or SU). On AG, individuals were supplemented with peanut butter from October to May in each year for a separate experiment focused on experimentally increasing squirrel population density28,38. On KL and SU, no food supplementation was provided. All models controlled for food supplementation status given its potential impacts on gut microbiome composition.

We collected 227 samples from 88 individuals across three years (2008–2010). When individuals were captured, they were handled such that their unique identity could be determined (by reading ear tags), sexed, and their reproductive condition could be recorded. Fecal samples were collected opportunistically during live-trapping from underneath the traps using forceps. Following capture and handling of squirrels, fresh fecal samples were collected from underneath the traps, kept on wet ice until they could be frozen at − 20 °C within 5 h of collection in the field. Samples contaminated with urine were not collected and all samples were kept at − 20 °C until analysis. We removed one fecal pellet from each sample using sterilized forceps for microbiome sequencing and then used the rest of the sample to measure fecal GC metabolites.

The age of each squirrel was known as individual squirrels were uniquely tagged in their natal nest when they were ~ 25 days of age and age is accordingly recorded at each trapping event38.

Squirrels were live-trapped regularly and handled using visualization to determine reproduction state. During each trapping event simultaneous with the collection of microbiome and hormone samples, the reproductive state of the individual was determined via abdominal palpation86. Males were considered reproductively active if their testes were scrotal, and not reproductively active if testes were abdominal. For females, pregnancy status was assessed via abdominal palpation for fetuses as well as by examining nipple condition. Females were determined to be reproductively active if they were gestating, lactating, or breeding based on nipple condition. We have previously found that females that are reproductively active (pregnant or lactating) have higher fecal GC metabolites than those that were not reproductively active whereas there were no differences in the effects of reproductive activity (presence or absence of scrotal testes) in males49.

Although red squirrels consume primarily white spruce seeds, they also consume a number of other foods (e.g., spruce bark and needles, willow leaves and buds, fungi, and bearberry flowers) and thus experience varying levels of seasonal dietary heterogeneity34. We coded dietary heterogeneity by ranking the availability of these different foods across seasons from greatest (3) to least (1). Samples collected prior to June of each year were ranked as 1, while samples collected in the month of June and late summer (July–August) were ranked as 2 and 3, respectively.

Densities (expressed as squirrels per hectare) for each grid of the study (KL, SU, AG) were calculated separately for each year (2008, 2009, 2010) across the dataset using census data. In May of each year, we determined the number of squirrels owning a territory on our study areas using a combination of live-trapping and behavioral observations. Because squirrels are diurnal, regularly exhibit territorial calls, and their territories are visually conspicuous, we were able to completely enumerate all squirrels living in our study areas.

Microbiome data used in this study are a subset of previously published data52. DNA extraction and sequencing was performed as described in Ren et al.52. Briefly, the V1–V3 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene was amplified using two universal primers: 27F (5′-ARGGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′) and 534R (5′-TTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-3′). Samples were barcoded for PCR amplification, pooled, gel purified, and then sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using 300 bp paired-end sequences. Sequences were then filtered, quality controlled, and reads were successfully merged using QIIME87. Chimeras were removed using USEARCH88 and sequences determined to be non-chimeric by both de novo and reference-based algorithms were retained. Reads were clustered to OTUs using UCLUST89 with an identity threshold of 97% (genus-level). Mitochondria and chloroplast were removed, and samples were rarefied to 4000 reads per sample.

The time period from collection in the field to freezing (~ 5 h) did not impact fecal GC metabolites49. We measured fecal GC metabolites using previously validated protocols49,90. Briefly, samples were lyophilized for 14–16 h, bathed in liquid nitrogen, and pulverized using a mortar and pestle. A subsample (0.05 g) was then extracted using 80% methanol where the samples were vortexed at 1450 RPM for 30 min followed by centrifuging for 15 min at 2500g49. The supernatant was then used in an enzyme-immunoassay that employed an antibody that measures GC metabolites with a 5α-3β,11β-diol structure91. We have previously validated this assay and shown that the antibody can accurately measure increases in adrenal production of GCs49. We have also shown that our measures of fecal GC metabolites are comparable across assays92. Using pooled samples that were run repeatedly on different plates (n = 115) in our laboratory show that the estimates of optical density for these pooled samples were highly repeatable (R = 0.851, 95% CI 0.543–0.925). Using a linear mixed-effects model, we partitioned the variance in the optical density recorded for the pooled samples that were run across these different plates and found that most of the variance was due to the sample itself (85.1%) with little of it being explained by intra-assay variation as all samples were run in duplicate (4.9%) or by inter-assay variation (9.9%).

All statistical analyses were conducted in R (v. 3.5.2.) (R. Core Team, 2015). OTU and taxonomy tables were imported into R and merged into a phyloseq object for downstream analyses using the ape93 and phyloseq94 packages. All figures were created in R, with the exception of the conceptual model (Fig. 1) and the structural equation model figures (Figs. 4 and Fig. S1), which were created in bioRender (www.biorender.com).

The estimate_richness() function in the phyloseq package was used to calculate the observed richness (Chao1) and Shannon Index of alpha diversity. Faith’s Phylogenetic Distances were calculated using the pd() function on the phyloseq object in picante95. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the relationship between bacterial diversity and fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (GCs), including individual ID as a random intercept, and collection date and food supplementation as fixed effects. GCs concentrations were log-transformed to improve model fit. Shannon Indices were Tukey transformed prior to analysis to achieve residual normality. All models were assessed for multicollinearity among predictor variables by calculating variance inflation factors (VIF < 5).

To identify the bacterial taxa whose relative abundances were significantly associated with changes in host GCs, we constructed negative binomial mixed models and implemented our analysis using the NBZIMM package96. Negative binomial models outperform other traditional differential abundance methods (e.g. DESeq) because they are better equipped to handle the zero-inflation and sparsity common to microbiome count data96. Taxa included in differential abundance testing were filtered with a liberal threshold of > 0.001% relative abundance to the overall microbiome community to avoid excluding rare taxa as they contribute substantially to measures of community diversity58,97. Models included the read count of each bacterial taxa as the dependent variable, GCs (scaled to zero mean and unit variance) as a fixed effect, controlling for collection date (fixed), food supplementation (fixed), and individual id (random). Taxa whose negative binomial models did not converge due to a high presence of zeroes were modeled instead with zero-inflated negative binomial models using the glmer.zinb() function in the same package (NBZIMM). We controlled the false discovery rate by applying a Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correction to all p-values. Adjusted p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

To integrate ecological and host variables into our model framework investigating the relationship between GCs and gut microbiome diversity, we constructed a structural equation model using (SEM) using the piecewiseSEM package69. SEM is an effective way to evaluate direct and indirect effects of multiple variables within complex ecological systems43. Unlike traditional variance covariance-based SEM, piecewise SEM approaches allow for the inclusion of random effects, the construction of a single causal network from multiple separate models, and the ability to handle small sample sizes and compare models using Akaike information criterion (AIC)69.

Using piecewiseSEM, we investigated whether the relationship between GCs and gut microbiome diversity (endogenous variables, i.e., variables of interest) was moderated by host and/or ecological factors (exogenous variables, i.e., variance outside of the model structure). All categorical variables were converted to numeric variables prior to modeling. To build the SEM, we first constructed two component linear mixed-effect models. The first model tested the effects of conspecific density, reproductive activity, dietary heterogeneity, and an upcoming mast on GCs. The second model tested the effects of reproductive activity, dietary heterogeneity, an upcoming mast, age, and GCs on gut microbiome diversity (Chao1 richness). Both component models included sample collection date and food supplementation status as a fixed effect and individual ID as a random effect. However, food supplementation did not affect GCs or gut microbiome diversity in either of the component models (effect on GCs: β ± SE − 4.86 ± 3.08, t = − 1.58, P = 0.12; effect on gut microbiome alpha diversity: β ± SE − 29.14 ± 79.13, t = − 0.37, P = 0.71), and was therefore removed from the SEM to improve model fit (AICc) and refine the standardized beta estimates. The overall fit of the SEM was evaluated using Shipley’s test of d-separation Fisher’s C statistic and AICc.
