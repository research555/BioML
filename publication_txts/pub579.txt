Maternal weight status and the composition of the human milk microbiome: A scoping review

The human milk microbiome is thought to partly contribute to the assembly of the infant gut microbiome, a microbial community with important implications for infant health and development. While obesity has well-established links with the adult gut microbiome, less is known about how it affects the human milk microbiome. In this scoping review, we synthesize the current literature on the microbial composition of human milk by maternal weight status, defined broadly as BMI (prepregnancy and postpartum) and gestational weight gain (GWG). This study followed the a priori protocol published in Prospero (registration #: CRD42020165633). We searched the following databases for studies reporting maternal weight status and a characterization of milk microbiota through culture-dependent and culture-independent methods: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Scopus. After screening 6,365 studies, we found 20 longitudinal and cross-sectional studies investigating associations between maternal weight status and the composition of the milk microbiome. While some studies reported no associations, many others reported that women with a pre-pregnancy or postpartum BMI characterized as overweight or obese, or with excessive GWG, had higher abundances of the genus Staphylococcus, lower Bifidobacterium abundance, and lower alpha diversity (within-sample diversity). This review suggests that maternal weight status is minorly associated with the composition of the milk microbiome in various ways. We offer potential explanations for these findings, as well as suggestions for future research.

Obesity—a global epidemic with far-reaching implications for maternal and child health—is characterized by excess adiposity, increased energy intake, reduced energy expenditure, and systemic low-grade inflammation [1]. Recent research has implicated the gut microbiome as a key mediator in the pathophysiology of obesity [2]. In particular, individuals with obesity harbor gut microbiota with low diversity and greater metagenomic capacity for dietary energy harvest [3].

Given that the milk microbiome is an emerging area of research, a scoping review design is optimal for examining the associations between maternal characteristics and the composition of the milk microbiome. In this scoping review, we aimed to investigate the extent and range of knowledge on the association between maternal weight status, broadly defined, and the composition of the milk microbiome.

The purpose of a scoping review is to rapidly explore and describe key concepts and evidence, often in underexplored areas of study. Compared to systematic reviews, which gather specific empirical evidence with a narrow and focused research question, scoping reviews are more flexible in the breadth of literature reviewed, thus allowing authors to comprehensively review the “scope” of a topic [23]. Because of the breadth of their research questions, scoping reviews are also suited to synthesizing topics with heterogenous or disparate evidence [24]. Thus, a scoping review is well-suited to exploring relationships with the milk microbiome.

We chose not to include a risk of bias assessment due to the exploratory nature of this area of research. We present the results in a table of key findings (Table 1) and in a narrative format. For a table with all extracted data, including additional characteristics of each of the studies, see S3 Table.

We found twenty studies (Tables
1 and
2; S3 Table) investigating associations between the human milk microbiome and maternal weight status. Only 4 of the 20 studies explicitly aimed to investigate relationships between maternal weight status and the milk microbiome [32, 34, 42, 48]. The remaining 16 out of 20 studies investigated weight status-milk microbiome relationships as part of their exploration of the data, not as a specific objective. Maternal weight status was commonly measured in three ways: prepregnancy BMI, postpartum BMI, and GWG. Most studies (17/20) characterized the milk microbiome through 16S rRNA sequencing, while some (6/20) measured specific microbial abundances through qPCR and others through culturing of microbes on selective media, which was often combined with other sequencing techniques (Table 1). One study [37] utilized 18.5S and 5.8S sequencing, which are techniques specific for the assessment of fungal communities. Two studies [37, 38] characterized milk microbial communities through the cultivation of bacteria and fungi on selective media.

Across all studies, the milk microbiome was composed of similar common bacterial taxonomic groups. Common phyla included Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes [34, 40, 51]. Common genera included Staphylococcus (predominant in 13/20 studies, range of relative abundance: 5–50%), Streptococcus (12/20 studies, 2.9–45.2%), Acinetobacter (6/20, 3.5–14.3%), Pseudomonas (4/20, 11.3–43.4%), Corynebacterium (5/20, 1.3–6.0%), and to a lesser extent, Bifidobacterium (4/20 studies, <1% abundance). It is important to note that the detection of Bifidobacterium is difficult through rRNA sequencing and often depends on the primers used and the type of hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA gene that were sequenced [52]. Only a few studies (6/20) employed specific approaches to detect Bifidobacterium and other low-abundance genera [30, 31, 45, 46, 48, 49].

Many included studies (12/20) found that BMI in the prepregnancy and postpartum periods were associated with the milk microbiome, although inconsistently and with low effect sizes. In one of the largest investigations of the milk microbiome to date (n = 393), Moossavi and colleagues [40] found that prepregnancy BMI was associated with the overall composition of the milk microbiome, although explaining <1% of its variation. Among Slovenian women, Treven et al. [43] reported that maternal postpartum BMI was not significantly associated with the specific patterns of the human milk microbiome (no effect size or p-value reported). Pace et al. [44] observed that in a cross-geographic comparison, there was not a significant relationship between postpartum BMI and overall milk microbiome composition (no effect size or p-value reported). Yan et al. [46] did not observe a statistically significant association between family-level milk microbiome community structure and maternal postpartum BMI (R2<0.2; p>0.05). Similarly, Williams and colleagues [34] observed no differences in overall composition at the phylum level between women of different prepregnancy BMIs (no effect size reported).

Prepregnancy and postpartum BMI appeared to be negatively associated with the alpha diversity of the milk microbiome, although some studies reported no association. According to Cortes-Macias et al. [48], prepregnancy BMI was negatively associated with alpha diversity (Shannon diversity: rho = -0.05, p = 0.582; richness: rho = -0.03, p = 0.753). Similarly, Cabrera-Rubio et al. [30] reported a negative association: women with obese prepregnancy BMI had more homogenous (less diverse) microbiota than other women (no effect size or p-value reported). Another study by Asbury and colleagues (conference abstract; [35]) demonstrated that over the first 8 weeks postpartum, women with normal prepregnancy BMIs had greater species evenness (i.e., the distribution of the abundances of various taxa [53]) compared to women with overweight or obese prepregnancy BMIs; however, microbial richness, or the number of different species in a sample, was not significantly associated with BMI. In a later study by the same research group, Asbury et al. [41] reported that while milk alpha diversity increased over the first 8 weeks among women with normal prepregnancy BMIs, this increase in diversity was delayed among women with overweight and obese BMIs (p = 0.04, no effect size reported). Finally, one study [42] found no significant differences in richness or diversity by prepregnancy BMI or by 3-month postpartum BMI.

Across the studies extracted by our review, maternal weight status appeared to be variably associated with the abundance of specific microbial taxa, particularly with Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Bifidobacterium. Higher prepregnancy BMI was associated with greater abundance of the phylum Firmicutes, greater abundance of Staphylococcus, lower abundance of Bifidobacterium, and lower Streptococcus (although this latter relationship was more variable). At the genus level, Davé and colleagues [32] observed in a small, cross-sectional sample of Mexican-American women that prepregnancy BMI was negatively associated with Streptococcus abundance (r = -0.67; p = 0.048) and positively associated with alpha diversity (r = 0.77; p = 0.016). Similarly, Cortes-Macias and colleagues [48] observed that compared to women with overweight prepregnancy BMI, women with normal BMI had greater Bifidobacterium (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 4.67 [95% CI: 2.53–8.64]), lower Staphylococcus (IRR: 0.89 [95% CI: 0.83–0.96]), and greater Ralstonia (IRR: 1.16 [95% CI: 1.03–1.32]). Lundgren and colleagues [39] observed that milk microbial composition clustered into four breastfeeding microbiome types (BMTs). Prepregnancy BMI was associated with “breastfeeding microbiome type” (BMT), such that for every one-unit increase in prepregnancy BMI, there was an increased odds for belonging to BMT1 (high Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, low alpha diversity) versus BMT 2 (high Streptococcus, high alpha diversity; [OR = 1.13 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.24)]), and BMT 3 (high Acinetobacter) compared to BMT2 (high Acinobacter and Pseudomonas, low alpha diversity; [OR = 1.12 [95% CI: 1.01–1.25]). That prepregnancy BMI was associated with BMT1 is of interest: BMT1 had a higher abundance of Firmicutes, a phylum that is typically higher in the overweight and obese gut microbiome [54]. Moossavi et al. [40] note that higher prepregnancy BMI was associated with less diversity within the phylum Proteobacteria and greater diversity within the phylum Firmicutes. LeMay-Nedjelski et al. [42] reported that women with obese prepregnancy BMI had lower Proteobacteria (IRR: 0.62 [95% CI: 0.43–0.90]), as well as greater Bacteroidetes (IRR: 3.70 [95% CI: 1.61–8.48]) and Actinobacteria (IRR: 2.34 [95% CI: 1.38–3.98]) compared to women with overweight and normal BMIs.

These relationships between BMI and Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Bifidobacterium also appear to hold over the course of lactation. Collado and colleagues [31] found that compared to women with normal BMI, women with overweight BMI harbored higher counts of Staphylococcus-group bacteria at 1 month (median, overweight/obese women (BMI > 25/kg/m2) = 4.94 gene copies/mL milk; median, “normal”/underweight women (BMI < 25 kg/m2) = 4.40 gene copies/mL milk). The study also found that women with overweight/obese BMI had marginally lower counts of Bifidobacterium-group bacteria at both 1 month (median, overweight/obese women = 5.30; median, “normal”/underweight women = 5.84 gene copies/mL of milk) and 6 months (median, overweight/ obese women = 5.19 gene copies/mL; median, “normal”/underweight women = 5.86; [28]). In a similar study, Cabrera-Rubio and colleagues [30] observed that maternal prepregnancy BMI was positively associated with Lactobacillus in colostrum (r = 0.6, p = 0.026), positively associated with Staphylococcus (r = 0.560, p = 0.038) and negatively associated with Bifidobacterium at 6 months (r = 0.651, p = 0.012). This study also found that over the first 6 months postpartum, women with obesity had higher total bacterial counts in milk (ratio: 0.34 [95% CI: 0.08–0.60]; p = 0.011), 0.48 times fewer Bifidobacterium (ratio: -0.48 [95% CI: -0.78–0.18]; p = 0.002), 0.62 times more Staphylococcus abundance (ratio: 0.62 [95% CI: 0.30–0.93]) and 0.52 times more Lactobacillus (ratio: 0.52 [95% CI: 0.02–2.02]; p = 0.038) compared to women with normal prepregnancy BMIs [30]. Asbury et al. [41] reported that women with normal prepregnancy BMIs had increased Corynebacteria and Escherichia-Shigella abundance over time (no effect size reported; p <0.05) and an inverted parabolic shift in Streptococcus in the first 6 weeks postpartum, patterns which contrasted with women with overweight and obese BMIs. The same study also found that women with obese prepregnancy BMI had higher Staphylococcus and lower abundance of Acinetobacter, Streptococcus and Prevotella in milk compared to women with normal prepregnancy BMIs over the first 6 weeks postpartum (p < 0.05; no effect size reported). Finally, Williams and colleagues [34] found that postpartum BMI was negatively correlated with the genus Bacteroides (Pearson’s r = -0.46; p = 0.037).

One study [48] investigated the possibility that relationships between maternal weight status and the milk microbiome are dependent on feeding mode. Cortes-Macias et al. [48] reported that prepregnancy BMI was associated with the overall milk microbiome composition in exclusively breastfeeding (EBF) women, but not in mixed-feeding (MF) women (EBF: Adonis Bray-Curtis R2 = 0.0254, p = 0.05; MF; Adonis Bray-Curtis R2 = 0.022, p = 0.029). Notably, this was only observed in women with normal prepregnancy BMI, and not in women with overweight prepregnancy BMI. EBF women with normal prepregnancy BMI also had higher diversity and richness, higher Bifidobacterium (no effect size reported; p = 0.033), and lower Pseudomonas (no effect size reported; p<0.01) compared to other groups [48]. These findings suggest that relationships between prepregnancy weight status and the milk microbiome may be partly dependent on feeding mode, particularly among women with normal prepregnancy BMIs. Lastly, Butts et al. [47] observed no significant differences in the milk microbiome composition at the genus and phylum level according to postpartum BMI categories (no effect size or p-value reported).

Six studies (6/20) reported relationships between GWG and the milk microbiome. In terms of milk alpha diversity, Cortes-Macias et al. [48] found that GWG was positively associated with alpha diversity; specifically, women with normal GWG had lower milk microbiome diversity (no effect size reported; p = 0.026). Similarly, according to Lundgren et al. [39], for every 10 pounds gained during gestation, the milk microbiome exhibited a 1-unit increase in alpha diversity (Simpson’s diversity, β = 0.23, p = 0.022).

In terms of specific taxa in milk, the results with GWG corroborated other findings involving prepregnancy and postpartum BMI; greater GWG appeared to be linked to greater abundance of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and lower Bifidobacterium. For example, Lundgren et al. [39] reported that women with differing GWG (normal vs. excessive) had distinct patterns of milk microbiome composition; increasing maternal GWG (per 10 pounds) was associated with decreased probability of belonging to BMT1 (high Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, low alpha diversity) vs BMT 2 (high Streptococcus, high alpha diversity) (OR = 0.66 [95% CI: 0.44–1.00]). Similarly, Cabrera-Rubio et al. [30] found that women with excessive GWG had more homogenous milk composition and higher counts of Staphylococcus aureus (median bacterial count, excessive GWG = 3.79; median bacterial count, normal GWG = 3.00; p = 0.03) at 1 month, higher Lactobacillus (median bacterial count, excessive GWG = 6.50; median bacterial count, normal GWG = 5.91; p 0.03) and lower Bifidobacterium at 6 months (median bacterial count, excessive GWG = 4.82; median bacterial count, normal GWG = 5.85; p = 0.02). Collado et al. [31] found that excessive GWG was associated with higher Staphylococcus in colostrum (p = 0.05; marginally statistically significant) and lower Bifidobacterium at 1 month (p = 0.03). Additionally, these authors ran mixed-models and showed that excessive GWG was associated with 0.42 times fewer Bifidobacterium-group bacteria in milk throughout the course of lactation (β = -0.42, p = 0.004, [95% CI: -0.71 to -0.14]). Cortes-Macias et al. [48] found that compared to women who had excessive GWG, women with normal GWG had greater incidence of Bifidobacterium (IRR: 3.20 (1.71–5.98)) and lower Ralstonia (IRR: 0.53 [95% CI: 0.46–0.61]); contrasting to findings from other studies, women with normal GWG had greater incidence of Streptococcus (IRR: 1.38 [95% CI: 1.27–1.51]). Cortes-Macias and colleagues [48] also found that mixed-feeding women with normal GWG had marginally greater abundance of Staphylococcus (p = 0.049) and Pseudomonas (p = 0.019).

Lastly, while most of the extracted studies (19/20) investigated only the composition of the milk bacteriome, one study described the composition of the milk fungal composition, or mycobiome, alongside the bacteriome of milk [37]. This cross-sectional, cross-geographic study (Spain, Finland, South Africa and China) found no associations with overall milk mycobiome composition and prepregnancy BMI. However, prepregnancy BMI was positively associated with the abundance of fungal genera Davidella and Sistotrema among South African women, and Staphylococcus and Bacilli abundance in Spanish women, and was negatively associated with Ascomycota and Sistotrema in Chinese women, and with unclassified Bacilli in Finnish women [37].

In this review, we investigated the scope of current knowledge on the relationship between maternal weight status and the composition of the milk microbiome. We conducted a comprehensive search in electronic databases and found 20 studies, 11 of which only reported significant associations, 4 reported both significant and null associations, and 5 reported only null associations between maternal weight status and the milk microbiome. We found that the aims and objectives of these studies varied—while a few studies explicitly focused on delineating maternal weight-milk microbiome relationships, most others reported these associations in their exploration of the data. As in previous reviews [19, 22], milk microbiota was typically characterized by high relative abundances of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Acinobacter, and other microbial species that overlap with the communities of the skin microbiome (Tables
1 and
2). In general, women who had an overweight or obese BMI in the prepregnancy or postpartum periods, or who experienced excessive GWG, all harbored milk microbiota with higher Staphylococcus, higher Streptococcus (although this was more variable), lower Bifidobacterium abundance, and lower alpha diversity than women with lower BMIs or normal GWG (Tables
1 and
2). However, despite these findings, weight status does not appear to be a major predictor of overall milk microbiome composition. In fact, one study reported that maternal BMI explained less than 1% of the variation in the milk microbiome [40], and several others reported that there were no significant associations between maternal weight status and overarching milk microbial composition and community structure [43, 44, 46]. In all, the composition of the milk microbiome may be mildly affected by maternal weight status. We suggest that a) the composition of the maternal gut microbiome, b) maternal diet, and c) breastfeeding and delivery practices may explain this minor effect of weight status on the milk microbiome.

Moreover, women with obesity are more likely to have Caesarian sections [75] and thus, delivery mode may partly explain weight-related differences in the milk microbiome. Infants born via Caesarian section have greater abundances of skin microbes, such as Staphylococcus, across various body sites, including the infant oral cavity [76, 77], a site that is known to influence the milk microbiome [40]. However, three of the reviewed studies [41, 42, 48] accounted for delivery mode as a confounder and still observed associations between maternal weight status and milk microbiome composition. Thus, this brings into question whether delivery mode is a strong driver of weight-based variation in the milk microbiome.

We offer suggestions for future research to help clarify the relationship between maternal weight status and the milk microbiome. First, many investigations identified in our review relied on BMI, a convenient but sometimes inadequate proxy for maternal nutritional status [62]. Maternal adiposity can be more accurately and precisely measured using skinfolds or dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Additional research could employ these techniques to evaluate whether maternal body composition, in conjunction with maternal diet and glucose tolerance status [42], are associated with milk microbiome. Second, the association between maternal weight status and the milk microbiome may be confounded with maternal diet and breastfeeding behavior. We suggest that future research attempt to tease apart these relationships by collecting detailed and triangulated measures of maternal diet (e.g., 24-hour recalls, Food Frequency Questionnaires), breastfeeding behavior (e.g., frequency of breastfeeding), alongside maternal anthropometrics and milk microbiome samples. Third, it remains unclear whether the milk microbiota has clinically and biologically meaningful impacts on intergenerational cycles of obesity. Although preliminary evidence suggests that the milk microbiome colonizes the infant gut to a measurable degree [14, 17], it is not known whether variation in milk microbiome composition (stemming from weight status or other maternal factors) begets variation in infant metabolic outcomes, such as in growth patterns or infant adipose deposition [78]. In fact, whether the milk microbiome independently impacts infant health and development has remained an unanswered question for some time [40, 62]. Future research could address this possibility, for example, by employing statistical models to assess whether milk microbiome variation predicts variation in infant gut microbiota and growth. Fifth, the populations included in this review are from industrialized, high-income, and urbanized countries, and likely do not represent the full scope of global variation in the human milk microbiome and its relationship with weight status. Although some cross-geographic research has been conducted on the human milk microbiome [79], future researchers could investigate how relationships between maternal weight status (using non-BMI measures; [80]) and the milk microbiome vary across populations exposed to different nutritional environments.

The strengths of this review include the adherence to an a priori protocol (registration #: CRD42020165633) and the breadth of the guiding research question, allowing us to identify a broad overview of an area of literature that is still underexplored. The findings of this scoping review can be used to guide research on the relationship between maternal metabolic states, the milk microbiome, and intergenerational risk of obesity. This scoping review also has limitations that warrant consideration. First, included studies differed in many ways including: their methods of milk collection, DNA extraction and amplification, sequencing depth, bioinformatic approaches, participant characteristics (e.g., maternal age, mode of breastfeeding), infant characteristics (e.g. gestational age, birth mode, age at data collection), and in the restrictiveness of inclusion/exclusion criteria. In particular, the hypervariable regions that were sequenced via 16S rRNA sequencing varied substantially between studies. This prevents side-by-side comparisons of results and thus limits the conclusions that can be drawn through analysis. In particular, the studies conducted by Asbury et al. [35, 41] had study objectives focused solely on pre-term infants (<37 weeks gestation) in their sample participants. Gestational age is a known influence on milk microbiome composition and thus caution should be taken when comparing results between pre-term and full-term infants [74, 81]. Second, there may have been publication bias towards statistically significant results in the studies we reviewed—for example, excluded studies may have not reported statistically insignificant relationships between maternal weight status measures and milk microbiome composition. Third, as mentioned above, the populations represented by these extracted studies are mostly from industrialized and urbanized regions of the world. Therefore, with some exceptions, the included studies likely do not represent global variation in the milk microbiome as they are confined to settings within industrialized populations.

This scoping review examines how measures of maternal weight status associate with the milk microbiome. Using a scoping review methodology, we found that current research supports the claim that maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, postpartum BMI and GWG are associated with distinct compositions of the milk microbiome. We posit that maternal gut dysbiosis and metabolic dysregulation associated with overweight or obesity, as well as other interrelated maternal factors (e.g., maternal diet, breastfeeding practices, delivery mode, and stage of lactation) are intertwined with weight status, and may explain weight-related differences in composition of the milk microbiome. However, additional research is needed to determine whether these maternal weight-related differences in milk microbiota meaningfully impact infant health, gut microbiome development, and later disease risk.
