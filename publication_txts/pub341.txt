Association of colitis with gut-microbiota dysbiosis in clathrin adapter AP-1B knockout mice

Inflammatory bowel disease results from alterations in the immune system and intestinal microbiota. The role of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in maintaining gut homeostasis is well known and its perturbation often causes gastrointestinal disorders including IBD. The epithelial specific adaptor protein (AP)-1B is involved in the establishment of the polarity of IECs. Deficiency of the AP-1B μ subunit (Ap1m2-/-) leads to the development of chronic colitis in mice. However, how this deficiency affects the gut microbes and its potential functions remains elusive. To gain insights into the gut microbiome of Ap1m2-/- mice having the colitis phenotype, we undertook shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis of knockout mice. We found important links to the microbial features involved in altering various physiological pathways, including carbohydrate metabolism, nutrient transportation, oxidative stress, and bacterial pathogenesis (cell motility). In addition, an increased abundance of sulfur-reducing and lactate-producing bacteria has been observed which may aggravate the colitis condition.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from abnormal cross-talk between the host and intestinal microbiota in an immunocompromised or genetically susceptible individual. IBD is considered as an autoimmune disease in which the body's own immune system attacks the elements of the digestive system. IBD is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation that can occur in both the small and large intestines. This inflammatory condition includes two main forms, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). In patients with IBD, high-throughput studies of intestinal microbiota using shotgun metagenomics or 16S rRNA sequencing have shown a state of dysbiosis, which is characterized by altered microbial diversity, viz., reduced phylum Firmicutes and enhanced Proteobacteria [1]. In addition, reports based on amplicon metagenomic sequencing have often exhibited imputed functional alterations and found altered metabolic pathways associated with increased nutrient transport systems, oxidative stress, and decreased amino acid metabolism [2]. However, heterogeneity in both IBD aetiology and pathology creates a complication in the generalization of microbial associations across the disease spectrum.

In our previous study the molecular mechanisms of AP-1B in immune homeostasis were explored. However, alternations in the microbial population due to the deficiency of this protein complex has not been addressed. In addition, the effect of the absence of the Ap1m2 gene on the gut microbes and their potential functions in the development or progression of spontaneous chronic colitis remains unknown. Towards this, we have performed a whole genome shotgun (WGS) based metagenomic analysis of mice lacking the Ap1m2 gene, which is responsible for expression of the AP-1B medium subunit (μ1B) [14].

All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the RIKEN Yokohama Branch. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions in the animal facility at the RIKEN Yokohama Branch. A total of eight fresh fecal samples were collected from four control (Ap1m2 +/-) and four knockout (Ap1m2 -/-) 10-week-old male (C57BL/6) mice. The fecal samples were stored at -80°C before DNA extraction.

Fecal DNA extraction was performed as described previously [15]. Briefly, 10 mg of freeze-dried fecal samples were disrupted with 3 mm and 0.1 mm zirconia/silica beads by vigorous shaking (1,500 r.p.m. for 5min) using a Shake Master (Biomedical Science) suspended in DNA extraction buffer containing 200 𝜇L of 10% (w/v) SDS/TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH8.0) solution, 400 𝜇L of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and 200 𝜇L of 3 M sodium acetate. After centrifugation, bacterial genomic DNA was purified by the standard phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol protocol. RNAs were removed from the sample by RNase A treatment.

The sequence libraries of WGS were constructed using the Illumina TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation kit having catalog number PE-940-2001. Sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform to generate 125 bp paired-end reads. In a step of End repair, the fragments were purified using AMPureXP beads with gel-free method. Each sample was run in a single lane. This approach generated around 1 Tb of sequence data for all eight samples. The quality of raw reads was analyzed using FastQC (version- 0.11.5) [16]. Adapter removal and Q-score (Q = 30) based filtering was done using FaQCs (version- 1.34) [17]. Duplicated sequences were removed by PRINSEQ (PRINSEQ-lite 0.20.4) [18] and host DNA was removed using Bowtie2 (version 2.2.5) [19].

Data analysis of metagenomic quality filtered reads was performed using the MEGAN Community Edition (version 6.8.18) [20]. Alignment (BLASTX) of the quality filtered reads was performed using DIAMOND (version 0.9.9.110) [21] at default parameters using nr-db (downloaded on 19 July 2017) as the reference database. The taxonomy and functional classification profiles were generated by MEGAN using a minimum score of 50 and a cutoff of the top 10%. The taxonomical and functional profiles were generated using the mapping files (prot_acc2tax-May2017.abin and acc2eggnog-Oct2016X.abin, respectively) provided on the MEGAN website. The backtracing of statistically significant functions with statistically significant taxa was done using EggNOG 4.5.1 [22]. The statistically significant differences between the control and knockout metagenomic samples were identified using STAMP (version 2.1.3) [23]. The differences between these two groups, or datasets, were analyzed using Welch’s t-test. The confidence interval and p-value threshold for the analysis was set to 95% and 0.05, respectively.

Additionally, the artifacts introduced during library preparation may introduce a bias in the resulting sequences. Apart from this, the abundance of taxa neccessary to exert a physiological effect also needs to be considered. With this in mind, we set abundance percent thresholds on all taxonomy levels, which have been found to be differing significantly between the control (CO) and knockout (KO) mice, to identify those taxa with an abundance equal to or greater than 0.005% in atleast one of the samples among all eight samples. In addition to this, a threshold was set at the functional level such that only those significant functions were considered for the downstream analysis that have a mean abundance difference between CO & KO groups > 5.

We sequenced four control (CO) and four knockout (KO) fecal samples using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. This resulted in 2,687,761,416 raw sequences with an average number of 335,970,177 reads per sample and an average read-length of 125 bps (S1 Table). After performing a quality filtering analysis, including adaptor trimming and removal of low quality reads, duplicated reads and reads matching to the mouse reference genome, 1,282,643,136 high quality reads (Q>30) with an average number of 160,330,392 reads and an average read length of 109 bps per sample were obtained.

Taxonomic composition analysis indicated that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the predominant phyla followed by Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria in all the samples of the control (CO) and knockout (KO) groups (S1 File). However, the proportion of these taxa was found to be different in the two groups. The KO group compared to the CO group exhibited increased levels of the phyla Firmicutes (CO: 66.62% and KO: 79.17%), Proteobacteria (CO: 0.31% and KO: 0.68%), and Verrucomicrobia (CO: 0.023% and KO: 0.22%). The levels of the phyla Bacteroidetes (CO: 31.88% and KO: 18.91%) and Actinobacteria (CO: 0.58% and KO: 0.33%) were found to be decreased in the KO as compared to the CO group. This observation indicated that while the proportion of each bacterial group was different in the two groups, the community composition remained unchanged.

Sequencing related artifacts are known to greatly impact the abundance of taxa in metagenomic sequencing [28]. To avoid this bias in our results, we discarded the less abundant reads (relative abundance < 0.005%) and re-assessed the significantly altered taxa between the CO and KO groups at all taxonomic levels (Table 1). We further explored the roles of these microbial species with respect to the formation of microbial fermentation products (butyrate, propionate, acetate, lactate and H2 pathways) using a comprehensive literature survey and gene content analysis. We explored these SCFAs mainly because of their potential involvement in gut homeostasis. The complete set of genes associated with butyrate and propionate production were not found in any of the mentioned species (S3 Table). The genes associated with lactate and acetate production were found in some species (~71%, 25%, respectively) while absent in others (~29%, 75%, respectively) (S3 Table). Additionally, we also correlated the involvement of these micro-organisms in previous colitis studies (Table 1).

The gut microbiota plays important roles in the physiological functions associated with nutrition, the immune system, and defense mechanisms of the host. However, dysbiosis in the microbial population caused by gene knockout in the host might lead to altered functions of the gut microbiota. To investigate the differences, if any, in the functional compositions between the CO and KO groups, we performed a comprehensive functional analysis of the WGS metagenomic reads. The functional annotations were obtained at three hierarchical levels. At level 1, the functions were grouped into three major categories including metabolism, cellular processes and signaling, and information storage and processing. A majority of the reads were mapped to the genes belonging to the metabolism category (Fig A in S4 File), however, no significant difference was observed between the CO and KO groups.

Certain functions were found to be increased in the KO as compared to the CO groups. For example, the gene belonging to the ycfa family (COG1724), which is involved in cell motility, was found to be increased in the KO group. The enzyme endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase (COG4724, COG4193) which is known for its enzymatic activity in mucin degradation, was also found to be increased in the KO group. Apart from these, some other genes, for example, the enzymes involved in DNA primase activity (COG0358), precursors necessary for DNA synthesis (COG1372), enzymes involved in DNA repair mechanism (COG4294, COG0322), etc. were found to be increased in the KO group. Furthermore, ABC transporters (COG0411, ENOG4111GBW), major facilitators (ENOG41105XQ, ENOG410XNZG, ENOG410XSHZ, ENOG410ZWA1), tonB dependent receptors (ENOG410ZNX6, ENOG410ZPJF, ENOG410ZJX3, ENOG410YNPF, ENOG410YAIR, ENOG410YB7D), tonB dependent receptor plugs (ENOG410XQAZ, ENOG410YB3G, ENOG4110QZN), etc. were found to be increased in the KO group. The genes involved in oxidative stress control, glutathione metabolism (COG0260), transcriptional regulator, crp fnr family (ENOG410ZDRF), and osmC family (ENOG4111UEA) were also found to be increased in the KO group. Additionally, genes involved in degradation of arginine (COG0010, COG2235) and histidine (COG1228) were also found to be increased in the KO group as compared to the CO group.

Alterations in the functional composition are expected to be a result of the alterations in the underlying microbial populations. Thus, we wanted to explore which significant functional changes might be exerted by which significantly differing bacterial taxa in the CO and KO groups. Towards this, we backtraced the significantly differing COGs/NOGs functional classes to their corresponding bacterial taxa. Out of the 201 significantly differing COGs/NOGs functions, 89 mapped to five bacterial species, which were also found to be significantly different between the CO and KO groups. These species included, Clostridium sp. BNL1100, Paenibacillus sp. Y412MC10, Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 5_2_54FAA, Desulfovibrio sp. 3_1_syn3, and Nitrobacter sp. Nb-311A (S6 Table). Out of these five species, two species, Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 5_2_54FAA and Desulfovibrio sp. 3_1_syn3, were found to have a relative abundance higher than 0.005%.

It has been reported previously [29] that an excessive hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production is found in the feces of ulcerative colitis patients. In this way, we explored the genes associated with H2S production pathways (using BioCyc and Microscope) in the above-mentioned bacteria which may eventually lead to colitis progression. The investigated pathways were sulfate reduction I (assimilatory), sulfate reduction IV (dissimilatory), sulfate reduction V (dissimilatory) and sulfur reduction II (via polysulfide) (S7 and S8 Tables). The two pathways for H2S production, viz., sulfur reduction II (via polysulfide) and sulfate reduction I (assimilatory) has been observed to be completely present in Desulfovibrio sp. 3_1_syn3 and Nitrobacter sp. Nb-311A, respectively (Table 3). Moreover, a 75% complete sulfate reduction I (assimilatory) pathway was found in Clostridium sp. BNL1100, Desulfovibrio sp. 3_1_syn3, and Paenibacillus sp. Y412MC10 (S7 and S8 Tables). Apart from this, a 60% complete sulfate reduction IV (dissimilatory) pathway was found in Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 5_2_54FAA (S7 Table).

In this study, we demonstrated that the Ap1m2 -/- (KO) mice have a different gut-microbiome pattern as compared to the control (CO) mice. We applied the WGS metagenomic method to discover the gut microbiome alterations in the two groups of mice (CO and KO) and identified the potential gut microbiome biomarkers, including composition and function of the microbiome, in the KO mice group. Our previous study indicated that the KO mice developed spontaneous chronic colitis, which was characterized by the acquisition of IL-17A and TNF-α production in these animals [13]. All together, these outcomes stipulate that the gut-microbiome structure might contribute in disease development in mice lacking the Ap1m2 gene.

As is evident from the above discussion that a large number of the functional alterations between the CO and KO groups correlated well with the observed processes known to play a role in IBD. It is important to note that a few functional alternations still remained inconclusive. The analysis presented in the paper provides future directions for the design of more targeted experiments for the validation of the functional alterations due to the knockout of Ap1 gene leading to spontaneous colitis in mice. This is the first prospective study using next-generation sequencing method to examine the fecal microbiota composition in Ap1m2+/- and Ap1m2-/- mice and highlights the role of the gut microbiome in the colitis phenotype induced due to the gene knockout. Our analyses has elucidated the important features of microbiome dysbiosis and dysfunction in terms of taxa and gene functions in Ap1m2-/- mediated colitis. It is evident from this study that for a physiological condition, it is not a single species or taxa which is responsible but a group of species or taxa are usually responsible for a diseased condition. However, it remains to be concluded whether the microbiota is the cause or an effect of this disease.
