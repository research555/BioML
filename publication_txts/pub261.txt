Young at Gut—Turning Back the Clock with the Gut Microbiome

Over the past century, we have witnessed an increase in life-expectancy due to public health measures; however, we have also seen an increase in susceptibility to chronic disease and frailty. Microbiome dysfunction may be linked to many of the conditions that increase in prevalence with age, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer, suggesting the need for further research on these connections. Moreover, because both non-modifiable (e.g., age, sex, genetics) and environmental (e.g., diet, infection) factors can influence the microbiome, there are vast opportunities for the use of interventions related to the microbiome to promote lifespan and healthspan in aging populations. To understand the mechanisms mediating many of the interventions discussed in this review, we also provide an overview of the gut microbiome’s relationships with the immune system, aging, and the brain. Importantly, we explore how inflammageing (low-grade chronic inflammation that often develops with age), systemic inflammation, and senescent cells may arise from and relate to the gut microbiome. Furthermore, we explore in detail the complex gut–brain axis and the evidence surrounding how gut dysbiosis may be implicated in several age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. We also examine current research on potential interventions for healthspan and lifespan as they relate to the changes taking place in the microbiome during aging; and we begin to explore how the reduction in senescent cells and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) interplay with the microbiome during the aging process and highlight avenues for further research in this area.

The microbiota, which is a dynamic community of bacteria, fungi, viruses, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes, is important to both lifespan and healthspan. While lifespan refers to the number of years lived, healthspan considers the quality of life and length of life that is disease-free and functional [1]. Over the past century, humans have increased their life-expectancy by roughly 30 years due to public health measures, such as clean water and sanitation [1]. However, with increasing age also comes increasing susceptibility to chronic disease and frailty [2,3]. Dysfunction of the microbiome can be linked to many conditions that increase in prevalence with aging, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and cancer [4,5,6,7].

The way in which the microbiome changes with age and how the immune system and the GBA work together to mediate changes across the lifespan and healthspan are not well understood; however, interventions targeting diseases and disorders of aging may be better understood by a thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying the aging microbiome. In this review, we examine how the changes in the microbiome with age are modulated by the immune system and GBA along with interventions for healthspan and lifespan, and begin to explore how the SASP and microbiome might be interwoven during the aging process (Figure 1).

The gut microbiome influences central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis via a variety of mechanisms that can have subsequent effects on lifespan and healthspan. Certain species of commensal bacteria are capable of secreting neurotransmitters (e.g., Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), noradrenaline, and dopamine) and altering host production of neurotransmitters in the body [46]. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers and resistant starches are known to possess neuroactive and/or epigenetic properties, playing a role in neuro-immunoendocrine homeostasis [47]. Following production of SCFAs, studies have shown that SCFAs can also influence blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, with germ-free (GF) mice exhibiting increased BBB permeability [48]. Furthermore, SCFAs can also traverse and modulate neurotrophic factor levels, neurogenesis, and neuroinflammation, thus contributing to neuronal function [47]. Additional neuroactive metabolites, such as kynurenine and its derivatives produced via tryptophan metabolism by the gut microbiome, have also been shown to regulate neuronal activity in the CNS and the periphery [49].

The population and diversity of the gut microbiome has been shown to change drastically with age, presumably due to numerous physiological changes, including alterations in chemical composition and structure of the colon. As aging is the most prominent risk factor for the development of several neurodegenerative diseases and other neurological conditions, the role of the aged microbiome in pathogenesis warrants further investigation. However, such studies have proven to be highly challenging due to variance in the abundance of families (one levelling another) within a phylum, resulting in an inability to detect significant changes at a low-taxonomic resolution [7]. The identification of specific changes at the genus/species level would be critical to reveal the precise contribution of microbial populations to pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, with a large cohort of patients, it may be possible to identify the specific gut microbial populations associated with disease. Such information would facilitate an insight into the mechanisms employed by the aged microbiome, which is critical for the development of diagnostics and therapeutic interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of aging on the CNS.

The gut microbiome exerts a profound effect on both local and systemic immune responses [71,72]. Having co-evolved with the gut microbiota, immune cells have developed several methods to maintain tolerance toward these commensal populations [73]. High levels of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor beta (TGFb), along with regulatory T-cells and tolerogenic macrophages, ensure a non-inflammatory profile of resident immune cells under homeostasis [73,74]. However, upon dysbiosis or increased permeability of intestines, an inflammatory response is induced in the gut and often at a systemic level, contributing to the development of disease.

Given the myriad mechanisms by which the gut microbiome appears to affect as well as mediate the immunological effects of aging, it is imperative to improve our understanding of these mechanisms. Firstly, it is essential to confirm whether age-associated gut dysbiosis is yet another consequence or a driver of inflammageing. Insight into these interactions would pave the way for gut-targeted therapies to either alleviate features of inflammageing or, more excitingly, delay aging itself. Since immune dysfunction is implicated in several aspects of aging and associated pathologies including neurodegenerative disease, the potential for such interventions restoring immune homeostasis is immense.

Although life expectancy has increased over the past century, frailty and disease susceptibility have also increased along with increasing age. Significant advancements have been made in anti-aging medicine (e.g., calorie restriction (CR), senolytics), gut microbiome therapeutics (e.g., probiotics, fecal transplants), and therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., exercise, pharmacological therapies) in the last few decades to target some of the challenges of living longer, with more research on the horizon [83]. Although these interventions are often categorized separately, they are all interconnected, and it may be important to treat them as such as we move forward in the field.

CR, which involves reduced caloric intake (typically 30–40%), without malnutrition or loss of essential nutrients, extends healthspan and lifespan in diverse models including rodents and primates, and impedes the accumulation of molecular damage [85]. CR can help to extend healthspan and lifespan via various mechanisms. For example, it can help prevent accumulation of cellular senescence through decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation, increasing sirtuins (which also helps reduce oxidative stress), increasing autophagy, enhancing DNA repair mechanisms, and inhibiting IGF-1 and mTOR [85,86]. CR also helps prevent neurodegenerative diseases through increasing neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection [87]. Evidence for how the gut microbiome plays a role in CR’s contribution to longevity is also emerging [88,89,90,91].

In mice, CR can help to mitigate age-related shifts in the gut microbiome, such as through increasing the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, Allobaculum, and Parasutterella [89] or through reducing age-related increases in Bacteroides and decreases in numerous genera within the Firmicutes phylum [92]. While some studies have found that CR affects the Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes phylum, and/or the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in either direction [89,92,93,94], others have found no such changes [95]. There are variations in the CR shifts in the gut microbiome, likely due to the high variation between study models and design (e.g., length of CR), suggesting the need for consistency in the length of CR intervention sufficient to affect change, as well as considering lab methods, storage conditions, and amplification method [96].

Diet plays a critical role, not only in healthspan and lifespan [97], but also in maintaining an optimal gut microbiome composition [98]. The Nu-AGE study found that in healthy older adults, plant-based diets (e.g., Mediterranean diet) are associated with increased alpha-diversity, increased relative abundance of the Bacteroidetes taxa, and increased anti-inflammatory microbials, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium rectale, and E. biforme; however, animal-based diets are associated with pro-inflammatory microbes such as Ruminococcus gnavus and Collinsella spp. [99]. To combat inflammation and the decreased SCFA production often seen in the elderly, an adequate amount of fiber should also be consumed [100,101,102,103,104]. Most prebiotics, which promote the growth of intestinal microbes, are associated with health and wellbeing and can be classified as dietary fibers [105]. The data from the Nu-AGE study demonstrate that diets like the Mediterranean diet can help curb the onset of frailty through preserving gut microbial diversity and decreasing inflammation.

Probiotics, which are live microorganisms that in appropriate amounts can benefit host health [106], are emerging as an intervention to promote lifespan and healthspan in model organisms. Probiotics commonly consist of Lactobacillus spp. or Bifidobacterium spp., which are both correlated strongly with lifespan [91,93,95,107,108,109,110,111]. Lactobacillus spp. prolongs C. elegans’ lifespan by about 10–20% [22,112,113] by altering the DAF-16/insulin-like pathway [112], increasing resilience to oxidative stress [110], stimulating the innate immune response [114], and mediating nuclear hormone receptors and PMK-1 signaling [115]. In aging rats, probiotics modulate AMPK activity and prevent telomere shortening [116]; protect aging bone and muscle [117]; and improve lipid, renal, and liver profiles, while also inhibiting the growth of pathogens Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis [118]. However, in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster, although a probiotic mixture increases mean and median lifespan, it decreases mean and median lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster with insulin receptor deficiency and a type 2 diabetes mellitus phenotype [119]. These preliminary studies suggest that although probiotics may impact pathways involved in longevity, they may not universally prolong lifespan, and thus, more work is required to distinguish factors associated with the utility or possible harm of probiotics.

Probiotics also interact with the GBA and have been explored as a novel therapeutic for neurodegenerative diseases. The effects of probiotics on inflammageing and oxidative stress are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration [126]. Furthermore, Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium [127] both inhibit pathogen disruption of the gut barrier, which could suggest protection against age-related gut neurodegeneration [126,128]. Further data suggest that probiotics may in fact aid in mental abilities and metabolism. For example, in a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial of 60 AD patients, the probiotic group showed better mini-mental status exam scores and metabolic measures after 12 weeks compared to the control group [129]. Evidence from clinical trials showing the impact of probiotics in neurodegenerative diseases and aging are still scarce and often inconsistent; therefore, further investigations are needed to determine which probiotics in which doses will benefit which particular disease state and in what populations.

Prebiotics are substrates, including food and non-food, that the host microorganism can utilize for a health benefit [8,130]. When prebiotics are combined with probiotics, it is termed “synbiotics.” In a randomized controlled trial of aging adults older than 65 years, prebiotic administration improved exhaustion and handgrip strength (criteria for frailty), likely through influencing the gut microbiota–muscle–brain axis [131]. However, prebiotic administration did not significantly affect the overall rate of frailty [131]. In another study, prebiotics, along with probiotics and synbiotics, influenced serum calcium levels and therefore benefited bone health in aging adults, but did not impact bone mineral density, parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, nor alkaline phosophatase [132]. Therefore, prebiotics show potential in improving healthspan independent of probiotics, although there may still be limitations to the use of prebiotics.

A fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), which involves transferring donor’s stool to the GI tract of the recipient to change the recipient’s gut microbiome, shows potential for anti-aging. FMT is the current accepted treatment for recurrent Clostridium (C.) difficile infection in adults, and has successfully alleviated abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea, while also increasing microbiota diversity in elderly patients infected with C. difficile [133]. In a recent study, progeroid mice (showing intestinal dysbiosis along with neurodegeneration) received FMT from wild-type (WT) mice and supplementation with Akkermansia muciniphila. FMT and supplementation increased both lifespan and healthspan by restoring secondary bile acids, suggesting the role of the gut in maintaining health [32]. Similarly, transplanting microbiota from long-living humans into mice results in greater alpha diversity, increased Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (probiotic genera), increased Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Coprococcus (SCFA producing genera), and decreased lipofuscin and β-galactosidase accumulation in the gut microbiome, all suggesting potential benefits to lifespan and healthspan [134].

Furthermore, microbiome transplants from healthy WT mice to transgenic mice with AD-like pathology alleviates the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and mitigates expression of genes for intestinal macrophage activity and circulating blood inflammatory monocytes [135]. Additionally, FMT from WT mice to transgenic mice decreases deposition of amyloid-β, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b) levels, increases synaptic plasticity, and reverses gut microbiota and SCFAs changes [136]. These data and others [137] all suggest that FMT may help to counteract aging-associated neurodegenerative changes through interactions with the immune system and cognitive-preserving effects.

One strategy for fighting cellular senescence is pharmacological therapy that can decrease the amount of SASP molecules produced by already present senescent cells that mitigate deleterious effects. The challenge with this action, however, is ensuring that the anti-oncogenic properties do not decrease [43,138]. These pharmacological therapies include metformin, rapamycin, and JAK-STAT inhibitors, and they may not only help with anti-aging through SASP, but also may interact with the gut microbiome.

Finally, JAK-STAT inhibitors hold the potential for regulating the impact of aging because of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway’s connection to proinflammatory products [148,149]. Inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling extends the lifespan of Drosophila through preventing metaplasia/gut proliferation and microbiota dysbiosis [150,151], and therefore, holds great potential in therapeutic intervention in humans as well. Although little research has been done to date investigating the effect of JAK-STAT inhibitors on the gut microbiome in humans, the evidence thus far holds potential [152].

Cellular senescence is a double-edged sword [153]. What constitutes an anticancer mechanism in early life exhibits tumor-promoting activities at a later stage, a phenomenon called Antagonistic Pleiotropy [154]. A rational solution to this phenomenon is deletion of these senescent cells in aging individuals. The Mayo Clinic pioneered work in developing “Senolytics” largely by targeting pro-survival pathways, such as Bcl-2 [155]. There are currently many compounds, both naturally occurring and manufactured drugs, being evaluated for their senolytic activity. Yousefzadeh et al. tested various flavonoids, out of which fisetin has yielded good senolytic activity, and luteolin and curcumin displayed weak, yet senolytic properties [156]. Some of these senolytic flavonoids, interestingly, have also been shown to affect the microbiota.

While there is some evidence for the influence these naturally occurring senolytics have on the microbiome, there is a paucity of research on impact of synthetics senolytics on the microbiome. With the emergence of clinical trials in developing senolytics drugs safe for human consumption, such as Dasatinib and Unity Biotechnology’s candidate UBX101, the drugs’ interplay with the aging microbiome are important elements to study on the aging population around the country.

Multiple randomized control trials have demonstrated the neuroprotective role of exercise, which alleviates neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional decline [166,167,168], and like diet, exercise can significantly shift the gut microbiome composition and improve healthy aging. Exercise increases the proportion of Bifidobacterium [169], the Bacteroidetes: Firmicutes ratio [170], or increases the abundance of Akkermansia and Butyricimonas in mice [169,170]; and in recent human studies, female and male lean participants who exercise exhibit higher SCFAs [171,172]; and active women show increased Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Roseburia hominis [173]. Furthermore, exercise likely plays a role in the GBA through vagus nerve tension, which helps with anti-inflammatory regulation [174,175], though further work is needed in this area of research.

Interestingly, various pharmacotherapies are used to treat neurodegenerative diseases, including cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, and vitamin E for AD [176], as well as dopaminergic medications (carbidopa/levodopa), COMT-inhibitors, and anticholinergics for Parkinson’s disease [177,178]. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are currently the only symptomatic medications for AD patients, but although these medications can help with cognition and global functioning, there is little evidence that these pharmacotherapies are neuroprotective or prevent disease progression [179,180]. Similarly, no current therapy for Parkinson’s disease can delay progression, even if it manages symptoms [181]. Additionally, COMT-inhibitors and anticholinergics can result in significant differences in the gut microbiome [178,182] and have gastrointestinal side effects [183,184] that may be tied to gut dysbiosis. Thus, pharmacotherapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently available to manage symptoms are far from perfect given the side effects, the gut disruptive effects, and the lack of influence on disease progression. More research is required not only on the relationship between current pharmacotherapies and the gut microbiome and aging, but also on improving currently available pharmacotherapies to treat neurodegenerative diseases.

Although we have made great strides in the fields of microbiome research, as well as the study of aging, there is much left to do. With the multitude of interventions currently available and continually being investigated to promote healthy living and increase healthspan and lifespan, it is often difficult for individuals and their providers to determine which are best to utilize. Precision medicine offers one avenue to provide better management of care with the great individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle that can influence the outcome of many of the interventions that we touched upon in this review. For example, CR [159] and probiotics [185] can be impacted by sex and diet [186], and metformin [187] can be impacted by genetic differences. Precision medicine, and especially precision medicine involving the microbiome, is still a nascent field, but further development of the field would help in the treatment of age-related disease.

In the future, it may also be possible to tailor and introduce diet modifications to facilitate gut microbiome-mediated improvements in healthspan and lifespan. It is important, however, to note that majority of the current mechanistic studies are limited to rodent or other animal models. The complexity and nature of interactions between the gut microbiome and the aging immune system could drastically vary between animal models and humans due to the presence of species-specific microbial populations [194,195]. It is therefore critical to increasingly conduct clinical studies and validate findings obtained from animal models in order to develop effective strategies to promote healthy aging in humans. As we look ahead at the fields of microbiome research and aging, the opportunities will continue to expand, and the connections among these physiological systems will continue to unfold.
