Investigating Colonization of the Healthy Adult Gastrointestinal Tract by Fungi



A wide diversity of fungi have been detected in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract with the potential to provide or influence important functions. However, many of the fungi most commonly detected in stool samples are also present in food or the oral cavity. Therefore, to recognize which gut fungi are likely to have a sustained influence on human health, there is a need to separate transient members of the GI tract from true colonizers. To identify colonizing fungi, the eukaryotic rRNA operon’s second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) was sequenced from the stool, saliva, and food of healthy adults following consumption of different controlled diets. Unlike most bacterial 16S rRNA genes, the only fungal ITS2 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in stool DNA across multiple diets were also present in saliva and/or food. Additional analyses, including culture-based approaches and sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene, ITS2 cDNA, and DNA extracted using alternative methods, failed to detect additional fungi. Two abundant fungi, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, were examined further in healthy volunteers. Saccharomyces became undetectable in stool when a S. cerevisiae-free diet was consumed, and the levels of C. albicans in stool were dramatically reduced by more frequent cleaning of teeth. Extremely low fungal abundance, the inability of fungi to grow under conditions mimicking the distal gut, and evidence from analysis of other public datasets further support the hypothesis that fungi do not routinely colonize the GI tracts of healthy adults.

IMPORTANCE We sought to identify the fungi that colonize healthy GI tracts and that have a sustained influence on the diverse functions of the gut microbiome. Instead, we found that all fungi in the stool of healthy volunteers could be explained by their presence in oral and dietary sources and that our results, together with those from other analyses, support the model that there is little or no gastrointestinal colonization by fungi. This may be due to Westernization, primate evolution, fungal ecology, and/or the strong defenses of a healthy immune system. Importantly, fungal colonization of the GI tract may often be indicative of disease. As fungi can cause serious infections in immunocompromised individuals and are found at increased abundance in multiple disorders of the GI tract, understanding normal fungal colonization is essential for proper treatment and prevention of fungal pathogenesis.

There are fungi in the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of all healthy people (1), where they can impact the immune system (2) and produce secondary metabolites that influence health (3, 4). One fungal strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii, is also commonly used as a probiotic to treat gastrointestinal disorders (5). However, fungi in the GI tract have been associated with numerous diseases based on case-control studies (see, e.g., reference 6) and may also contribute to the millions of invasive fungal infections that occur in immunocompromised individuals every year (7). Considering that ~0.01% to 0.1% of metagenomic reads from adult stool samples have mapped to fungal species (8, 9) and that fungal genomes are ~3 to 10 times larger than bacterial genomes, it is possible to estimate that of the >1013 microorganisms in the GI tract (10), about a billion compose what is often referred to as the gut mycobiota or mycobiome (11).

We sought to differentiate transiently present fungal species from those that colonize the GI tract. However, our controlled-diet and dental hygiene experiments suggested that all of the fungi detected were transiently associated and therefore that possibly no fungi had colonized the GI tracts of the individuals examined. Analyses of large public gut microbiome data sets and the failure of fungi to grow under gut-simulating conditions lend growing evidence to support the hypothesis that fungi are excluded from colonizing the GI tracts of most healthy Western adults.

Because the environment of the GI tract limits colonization to certain organisms, with sufficient sampling, a large portion of the total diversity of colonizers can be identified and the detection of new organisms plateaus. In contrast, transient populations would not be required to survive in the gut and therefore would not have the same restrictions on diversity. The fungi present in stool samples of healthy adults in the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) cohort were previously examined through amplification and sequencing of the eukaryotic rRNA operon’s second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) (1). We examined the rate at which new fungal ITS2 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) could be detected in HMP stool samples and compared this to the rate of detection of new 16S rRNA gene OTUs using all samples that had at least 1,000 reads from each analysis (148 shared samples from 100 volunteers). Sequences from both regions were clustered into OTUs at 97% identity, which is roughly species level (17). For individual samples, the number of unique ITS2 OTUs was typically lower than that of 16S rRNA gene OTUs. However, when at least 70 samples were examined, ITS2 diversity surpassed that of 16S rRNA genes (Fig. 1). When all 148 samples were included, there were 501 ITS2 OTUs, compared to 385 16S rRNA gene OTUs. The addition of new OTUs most closely follows a power function for ITS2 and a logarithmic curve for 16S rRNA genes. This difference in the rates of identifying new OTUs is consistent with the possibility that most of the detected fungi were ultimately derived from the consumption of different foods, which contain, as a whole, more unique microorganisms than those that may be colonizing the GI tract.

We further analyzed the data to identify the specific fungal taxa consistently present over time. There were 42 volunteers with three longitudinal samples containing at least 1,180 (mean, 54,880) nonplant ITS2 reads each. Although there was a mean of 10.3 (range, 2 to 32) ITS2 OTUs present at ≥10 reads/sample, only OTUs representing Saccharomyces cerevisiae (30 volunteers) and Malassezia restricta (19 volunteers) were present at all sampling points for two or more volunteers (see Table S1 at https://github.com/auchtung/Auchtung2018). However, it is possible that additional, low-abundance fungi were present but obscured by the various fungal species found associated with foods and that they could be discovered by examining the stool of volunteers that consumed controlled diets of known fungal composition.

To identify fungi colonizing the human GI tract, each of four healthy Western adult volunteers (volunteer 1 [V1] to V4) of diverse geographical and dietary backgrounds consumed the same sequence of four predefined diets of nuts and dried berries (A); beans, rice, and corn (B); pasta and marinara sauce (C); and an egg, sausage, and cheese sandwich and peas (D) (see Table S2A and B at https://github.com/auchtung/Auchtung2018). The diets were selected for their representation of major food groups, their relatively low fungal load, and their simplicity, which allowed all components to be sequenced to identify the fungi present. Saliva samples were collected throughout, and the second stool sample seen to contain food or dye from the particular diet was collected (the time of collection differed among the samples but was typically 2 days after the volunteer commenced the diet). All volunteers also provided stool and saliva samples on a day when they consumed their regular (uncontrolled) diet. Concurrently, a fifth healthy volunteer (V5) on an uncontrolled diet also donated stool samples. Fungi present in stool, saliva, and controlled-diet components were examined by sequencing the ITS2 region from extracted DNA. Orthogonal approaches were taken to ensure that no fungi in stool went undetected, including amplifying and sequencing ITS2 cDNA from reverse-transcribed RNA and 18S rRNA genes from DNA, examining fungi in DNA extracted by different methods, and culturing viable fungi. For comparison, the bacterial and archaeal community was examined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as necessary.

As an additional test to examine whether any fungi were not detected by molecular analyses, and to gauge which fungi were able to survive gastrointestinal transit, stool samples were also plated on fungus-selective Sabouraud agar. Many of the most abundant fungal taxa identified by ITS2 sequencing of V1, V2, and V4 samples were also isolated by culturing (see Table S2Q at https://github.com/auchtung/Auchtung2018). Little was isolated from V3, in agreement with molecular analyses. C. albicans and Saccharomyces were the only fungi identified from plates grown anaerobically, and no fungal growth was detected on anoxic YCFA media (77), which can support the growth of most gut bacteria (21). In summary, there is no evidence that any fungi in stool were missed by biases in our approach to their detection; no fungi were consistently present in the gut unless they also existed in the saliva or diet.

The GI tract may not be an accommodating environment for most fungi, as they must compete for nutrients while resisting inhibitory compounds produced by commensal bacteria such as short-chain fatty acids (22) and secondary bile acids (23). Fungal growth under the conditions found in the GI tract can be tested in vitro through the use of bioreactors, which are known to support growth of complex fecal bacterial communities (24). We examined the identity and abundance of fungi present within the complex communities of minibioreactor arrays after inoculation with stool from a healthy adult. Communities were cultivated at 37°C in media that varied in composition, under conditions of either an anoxic or hypoxic atmosphere (see Table S4 at https://github.com/auchtung/Auchtung2018). Samples were collected between days 2 and 7, when the communities typically had stabilized. Only one bioreactor, with high-sugar hypoxic media and a very low diversity of bacteria, contained elevated levels of fungi (≥104 ITS2 copies/ng total DNA on days 4, 5, and 6). C. albicans was the only fungal species detected in these samples. Under conditions that resembled the healthy distal gut—low oxygen, simple sugars, and a diverse bacterial community—there was no evidence of fungal persistence.

We examined whether Saccharomyces, a genus of yeast that can survive gastrointestinal transit and one of the most commonly detected fungi in most examinations of human stool, would continue to be detected in a healthy adult volunteer after consumption of a S. cerevisiae-free diet (see Table S5A at https://github.com/auchtung/Auchtung2018). Although it has been shown that the probiotic S. cerevisiae var. boulardii is cleared within a few days of consumption (25), the retention of other strains of Saccharomyces has not been examined. Here, a volunteer collected all stool samples over the course of a 15-day experiment as follows: 1 week on a regular diet, followed by 1 week on a S. cerevisiae-free diet, followed by a final day where some foods containing S. cerevisiae were consumed. Samples were examined both by ITS2 and 18S rRNA gene analysis. Since there is only a single base pair in ITS2 distinguishing S. cerevisiae from related species (and since there are none in 18S rRNA genes), the OTU may contain multiple species of the genus and is referred to here as Saccharomyces. High levels of Saccharomyces were detected over the course of a normal diet (days 1 to 7), with the final sample containing 86% Saccharomyces ITS2 reads (Fig. 4; see also Table S5B at https://github.com/auchtung/Auchtung2018). After 2 days of consumption of a S. cerevisiae-free diet by the volunteer, Saccharomyces comprised just 0.1% of the reads (day 9). After unintentional consumption of a small amount of bread, there was a spike in the relative abundance of Saccharomyces on day 10 to 16% of the reads. However, by day 11 the abundance had again fallen to just 0.16% Saccharomyces. Reads of Saccharomyces were below the level of detection in the remaining S. cerevisiae-free diet samples (days 13 and 14). After the S. cerevisiae dietary exclusion had ended, Saccharomyces again became one of the most abundant taxa detected (day 15). The 18S rRNA gene data were similar to the ITS2 data, with the relative abundances of Saccharomyces just above the level of detection on days 9 and 11 and below the level of detection on days 13 and 14 (see Fig. S7 and Table S5C at https://github.com/auchtung/Auchtung2018). These data suggest that the Saccharomyces in the volunteer’s stool may have entirely originated from dietary S. cerevisiae.

Candida albicans has long been studied for its role as an opportunistic pathogen (26). It is a leading cause of nosocomial infection, particularly in immunosuppressed patients (27). In our controlled-diet-experiment ITS2 analyses, it was the most abundant taxon overall in both stool and saliva. C. albicans is frequently described as colonizing the human GI tract; however, to our knowledge, there has been no study that has demonstrated that this is true in healthy human individuals.

Since C. albicans is common in the oral cavity (15) and contributes to the formation of dental plaque and the development of caries (28), we wanted to assess the contribution of C. albicans in swallowed saliva to what is detected in stool. For all experiments, saliva or blended stool was plated on Sabouraud plates containing antibiotics. Possible C. albicans colonies were later spotted on chromogenic media to distinguish from closely related species. First, we confirmed that there was a difference in the levels of C. albicans in the saliva of a volunteer when the volunteer's teeth were brushed with conventional fluoride toothpaste either once per day (at night) or after every meal (3 to 4 times/day). Toothpaste helps remove plaque but does not significantly impact the viability of C. albicans (29). The levels of C. albicans measured in the oral cavity were relatively variable but were higher on average in saliva and plaque when teeth were brushed just once per day (Fig. 5A). Next, we monitored the change in abundance of C. albicans in stool when teeth were cleaned after every meal instead of once per day and saw that levels decreased from 106 cells to 104 to 105 cells (Fig. 5B). Finally, to confirm that the decrease was not due to unrelated artifacts, we monitored C. albicans in stool while the protocols for cleaning of teeth were alternated: 2 days cleaning after every meal, followed by 2 days cleaning once per day, each done four times in total over 16 days. The total number of C. albicans colonies found in stool was significantly greater (two-sample equal variance t test P = 0.0007) after the volunteer brushed just once per day (mean = 8.3 × 105) than after the volunteer brushed after every meal (mean = 2.5 × 105) (Fig. 5C). A second volunteer who repeated a shorter version of the experiment on nonconsecutive days also had less C. albicans in stool after the volunteer brushed their teeth after every meal (Fig. 5D). Together, these experiments suggest that a large portion of C. albicans in the stool of the volunteers was derived from the oral cavity.

Here we investigated fungal colonization of the healthy adult GI tract from multiple perspectives. We conducted a controlled-diet experiment to examine the abundance and identity of fungi present across multiple diets and then further investigated the dynamics of the two most abundant fungi, Saccharomyces and C. albicans, when dietary or oral hygiene practices were altered. We also examined fungi in bioreactors and in a large data set of healthy adults. From all avenues of investigation, the evidence suggests that fungi may not readily colonize the GI tracts of healthy adults in Western society.

In summary, we have shown that fungi detected from the GI tracts of volunteers across multiple diets were at very low abundance, were only transiently present from the diet or oral cavity, and did not grow when placed in gut-like conditions. In addition, the levels of two common fungal species in stool were shown to be directly affected by altering the oral hygiene or the dietary consumption of the volunteers, and analyses of data from larger cohorts were consistent with the possibility that fungi may not colonize the guts of healthy adults in Western society. More studies are needed that are mindful of dietary and oral fungi and that examine the relative contributions of immunological defenses, fungal ecology, and human evolution to limiting fungal persistence in the healthy modern adult GI tract.

ITS2 and 16S rRNA gene sequences from the Human Microbiome Project are available at NCBI (BioProject PRJNA356769) and the Human Microbiome Project website (http://www.hmpdacc.org), respectively. There were 148 samples that had at least 1,000 plant-filtered ITS2 and 16S rRNA gene reads. The data sets were rarefied to 1,000 reads by the use of single_rarefaction.py (70). Rarefaction curves were calculated with mothur v1.36.1, which uses a resampling-without-replacement approach (71).

Four healthy people (ages between 25 and 37), all born and primarily raised on different continents (but who were residing in Houston, TX, for the duration of the study), with diverse dietary habits, consumed four identical diets (see Table S2A and B at https://github.com/auchtung/Auchtung2018). The diets were composed of a variety of food groups, largely low in fungi (except diet D), and were kept simple to facilitate analysis of all components. Volunteers did not consume probiotics or vitamins and did not chew gum but were allowed coffee, tea, and salt, as long as those foods were submitted for fungal sequencing analysis. There was no limit to the amount of food consumed. The diets were consumed nonconsecutively and in no set order over the course of 1 month, April 2016. Volunteers had the option to consume a 100-mg Brilliant Blue Lake (FD&C Blue 1 dye) pill at the start of each diet to clarify via staining that stool samples were primarily resulting from the particular diet and were ready to be collected. Volunteers collected a stool sample (12 to 222 g; mean, 77 g) following the appearance of the particular diet (or dye) in their stool. Saliva samples (typically three/diet) were collected at time points that were at least 2 h apart and at least 1 h after eating to reduce the number of plant particles that might obscure the detection of fungi. All samples were frozen at −80°C until nucleic acid extraction.

ITS2-specific primers ITS3F and ITS4R and 16S rRNA gene-specific primers Bact1369F and Prok1492R were used in quantitative PCR analysis of controlled-diet fecal DNA samples using Applied Biosystems Power SYBR green PCR master mix following the manufacturer's instructions, with 60 s (ITS2) or 30 s (16S rRNA gene) of annealing/extension at 60°C. To create nonsupercoiled standard curve templates (75), DNA from Malassezia cuniculi (450-bp ITS2) or Escherichia coli rrsA was amplified using the primers specified above, except that the procedure also used an additional 64 (ITS3F and ITS4R), 18 (Bact1369F), or 19 (Prok1492R) 5′ nucleotides (nt) so that quantitative PCR primers would not have to anneal to the very end of the template.

Experiments were conducted in minibioreactor arrays as previously described (24) using five different media under conditions of either an anoxic (5% CO2, 95% N2) or hypoxic (2% O2, 5% CO2, 93% N2) atmosphere (see Table S4 at https://github.com/auchtung/Auchtung2018). For each medium/atmosphere condition, triplicate 15-ml reactors were inoculated with a 25% fecal slurry (containing 75% reduced PBS) and allowed to sit for 16 h (anoxic reactors) or 4 h (hypoxic reactors) before flow was initiated at 1.825 ml/h (anoxic) or 3.75 ml/h (hypoxic). The hypoxic bioreactors had a shorter initial wait and higher flow rate to more closely resemble the upper GI tract. Samples for DNA extraction (as described in reference 76) and sequencing were collected daily from each reactor over the course of 7 days. Quantitative PCR was performed as described above.

A single healthy adult volunteer ate regularly for 1 week and then avoided eating foods containing S. cerevisiae for 1 week, followed by 1 day of eating foods with a large amount of S. cerevisiae (see Table S5A at https://github.com/auchtung/Auchtung2018). Over the course of the 15 days, the stool samples were collected and frozen, typically once daily. Two months later, samples were collected during 3 days of a regular diet. DNA from approximately 250 mg frozen stool was extracted using the Mo Bio PowerSoil protocol and analyzed as described above, with an average of ≥55,000 ITS2 and ≥25,000 18S rRNA gene reads/sample. We defined the limit of detection as 10 reads of Saccharomyces, since 27 pure culture controls had ≤10 reads from barcode bleed-over.

To test the effect of increased tooth brushing (after every meal, within 30 min) on C. albicans levels in saliva of a healthy adult volunteer, for every hour from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. over 2 consecutive days during which the same diet was consumed, 200 μl of saliva was spread on Sabouraud media containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol. The numbers of colonies were counted after 24 h at 37°C and were adjusted after 48 h following verification of the presence of previously small colonies. Up to 10 colonies/plate were spotted onto chromogenic BBL CHROMagar Candida (BD) and grown for at least 48 h to distinguish C. albicans from related species. Since the cells do not grow as well on the chromogenic agar, resulting in fewer colonies, the medium was used only to assess the identity of Sabouraud-grown colonies. The reported number of C. albicans cells in each sample was corrected using these data.

To test how the levels of C. albicans in stool of healthy volunteers were affected by variations in tooth-brushing protocols, the following experiments were conducted. First, over the course of 8 days, during which time the volunteer brushed their teeth after every meal instead of once per day, entire stool samples were collected and blended with PBS, and 150 μl was plated in triplicate on Sabouraud media containing antibiotics. In a second experiment, the following protocol was repeated by the same volunteer four times: brushing of teeth once per day (at night) for 2 days and then after each meal for 2 days. For the course of the experiment, the volunteer defecated once per day at the same time (±30 min). On the day after each 2-day protocol, a full stool sample was collected and blended with PBS, and 50 μl was plated in triplicate. A variation of this experiment was conducted by a second volunteer but on nonconsecutive days and following each protocol twice. Volunteers were instructed to eat similar amounts of sugary foods between the protocols, avoid Penicillium-rich cheeses, and avoid heavy consumption of alcohol. At the end of the stool experiments, all presumed C. albicans colonies from at least one random replicate plate/day were spotted onto chromogenic agar as described above. The t test was performed in Excel.
