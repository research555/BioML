MODIMA, a Method for Multivariate Omnibus Distance Mediation Analysis, Allows for Integration of Multivariate Exposure–Mediator–Response Relationships

Many important exposure–response relationships, such as diet and weight, can be influenced by intermediates, such as the gut microbiome. Understanding the role of these intermediates, the mediators, is important in refining cause–effect theories and discovering additional medical interventions (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics). Mediation analysis has been at the heart of behavioral health research, rapidly gaining popularity with the biomedical sciences in the last decade. A specific analytic challenge is being able to incorporate an entire ’omics assay as a mediator. To address this challenge, we propose a hypothesis testing framework for multivariate omnibus distance mediation analysis (MODIMA). We use the power of energy statistics, such as partial distance correlation, to allow for analysis of multivariate exposure–mediator–response triples. Our simulation results demonstrate the favorable statistical properties of our approach relative to the available alternatives. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the proposed methods in two previously published microbiome datasets. Our framework adds a new tool to the toolbox of approaches to the integration of ‘omics big data.

Natural biological phenomena are often explained using statistical methods by means of isolating the individual contexts of the phenomenon itself by establishing associations. For example, obesity, among other factors, maybe related to changes in nutrition or stress. Although these explanations fail to present a full account of the original observed phenomenon or capture the entirety of such complex dynamics, they aid in our understanding of the cause–effect relationships, especially when a plausible causal directionality can be established (e.g., increase in calorie consumption is plausibly causal to weight gain, and not the other way around). The next level of complexity is afforded by incorporating additional mechanisms arising from one or more other intermediate factors. In order to properly understand the mechanisms involved, we must understand the extent to which the exposure of interest (calorie intake) directly affects an outcome (weight gain) and the extent to which the exposure indirectly affects the outcome through intermediate factors (e.g., gut microbiome) [1,2,3,4]. Mediation analysis is at the heart of many human behavior studies and is quickly gaining traction in the biomedical research arena. With the explosion growth of the ‘omics, we see the development of new analysis and tools that provide access to the integration of new knowledge and their applications as mediators of treatment–effect relationships.

In this article, we present a framework for testing multivariate distance mediation to allow for multivariate exposures, responses, and mediators. We build our test on the mediation approach published by Boca et al. [14] and extend it to high-dimensional data via distance-based methodologies. We present simulation results on the robustness and sensitivity of the proposed methods and further make comparisons with other proposed approaches, such as permutation-based testing by Boca et al. [14] and sample-wise distance matrices by Zhang et al. [17]. Lastly, we analyze two real datasets to demonstrate the power of the proposed methods and their application to high-dimensional microbiome data.

The testing framework developed by Boca et al. [14] expresses the relationships captured in the SMM linear regressions in terms of Pearson correlations. Thus, for a significant effect of the exposure on the response to exist, the correlation between the two has to be non-zero,
ρX, Y>0
. Furthermore, if the relationship is in fact mediated by M, both the correlation between exposure and the mediator and the conditional correlation of the mediator and the response, given the exposure, should be non-zero [13],
ρX, M>0
and
ρrM|X, rY|X>0
, respectively. Here,
rM|X and rY|X
denote the residuals of the conditional correlation on regression of X on M and X on Y, respectively. These observations give rise to the following test statistic:

Székely and Rizzo introduced a series of non-parametric tests of covariance and correlation based on energy statistics, the theoretical understanding that observations are governed by a statistical potential “energy” which is zero if and only if the underlying statistical null hypothesis is true [18]. In this context, assessments and relationships of objects are made by first calculating corresponding distances of objects and all hypothesis testing and inferences are made based on these initial distances. This allows us to compare objects against each other using their relative distance and without any knowledge about their size or other properties. In this publication, we make use of distance correlation, dCor [19], and partial distance correlation, pdCor [20], which are available in R package energy [21].

The Pearson partial correlation which measures the partial correlation in vectors x and y, controlling for z, is described with the following partial correlation coefficient:

In modeling relationships between multivariate variables, we must be able to express the relationship between those in terms similar to the Pearson correlations and partial correlations. To do so, we use distance correlation and partial distance correlation statistics that are capable of capturing relationships between vector-valued random variables. These statistics naturally flow from the definition of Pearson correlation by allowing a distance metric (such as Euclidean distance, or specialized distances for microbiome data) to serve as a sufficient statistic for the dependence relationship within each random vector. Using these, the multivariate omnibus distance mediation analysis (MODIMA) test statistic is as follows:

For a more intuitive understanding of the MODIMA method, consider the illustration in Figure 1. Suppose our data consists of
n
observations for
px
exposure,
pm
mediator, and
py
response variables. The test statistic is obtained by first calculating the
n×n
distance matrices from just the exposure,
dXX
, just the mediator,
dMM
, and just the response,
dYY
, variables. Note that the distance (or dissimilarity) metric can potentially be different for each of these, as appropriate given the nature of these variables. The distance matrices are then used to compute the distance correlation between the exposure and mediator and the partial correlation between the mediator and the response, given the exposure. These two quantities are then multiplied together to obtain the test statistic in Equation (7).

The permutation testing approach for the MODIMA method follows that of Boca et al. [14]. In short, to obtain the empirical distribution of the MODIMA test statistic
Sd
under the null hypothesis, either the relationship between the exposure and mediator, or the conditional relationship between the response and the mediator has to be scrambled. Thus, if the magnitude of the first is smaller than that of the second, we permute the rows and columns of the
dXX
matrix and re-compute the test statistic
Sdi
. Conversely, a permutation of the response distance matrix
dXY
is performed to re-compute the test statistic if its partial correlation with the mediator is greater. The p-value of the observed
Sd
is obtained as the frequency with which the permuted statistic exceeds the observed in
q
permutations,
P=1q∑i=1q1(Sd≤Sdi
). Permutation testing is generally a powerful way to simulate from the null distribution; however, it is often hard to compute estimates of extremely small p-values. Although not implemented in this version of MODIMA, solutions exist to estimate small p-values based on fitting extreme value distributions to the permuted test statistics (e.g., application of Pareto distribution to permutation testing [24]). Reference R language implementation of the MODIMA test is available at https://github.com/Alekseyenko/MODIMA.

Single mediator. To assess statistical properties of the proposed omnibus method and compare it to existing methods, we simulated data where exposure,
X
, mediator,
M
, and response,
Y
, were normally distributed and followed the linear model formalism of the single mediator model (Figure 2). In this case, we varied the parameters
α, β, and γ
as follows:
α=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1
,
β=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1
, and
γ=0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5
. Under each combination of parameters, we simulated datasets with a varying number of observations,
n=20, 50, 100, 150, 200
. To ensure unit variance, the standard deviations of
X, M, and Y 
were fixed at
SDX, M, Y=1
. Euclidean distance was used to compute the distance matrices. For each combination of parameters, we generated 1000 datasets for a total of 250,000 datasets. Each dataset was analyzed using our reference implementation of MODIMA as well as previous methods proposed by Sampson [14] and Chen [17].

The simulation results comprise the sample size-dependent type I error rates and power as a fraction of rejected null hypotheses at a significance threshold of 0.05 for each test (Figure 3 and Figure 4). In the case of the single mediator, when the null hypothesis is true (Figure 3A), the association of the exposure with the mediator (
α=0
) or the effect of the mediator on the response (
β=0
) are absent. A test properly controlling type I error rate is expected to have a fraction of rejections equal to the nominal error rate (0.05, in this case). In the cases of
β=0
, as α and γ are increased, we observe inflation of this type I error rate for MODIMA; however, Sampson [14] and Chen [17] methods often display overly conservative type I error rates. This effect has been previously described [20] and is related to the fact that zero partial distance correlation does not correspond to conditional independence. We review this point further in the Discussion section. Our proposed method is able to demonstrate equal or better power (Figure 3B), often increasing power with the increase of mediating effect. Within a few selected parameters, all three methods performed equally. Notably, the MedTest method often shows the least power and does not perform well when the association of the mediator with the exposure is much higher than the association of the mediator with the response (Figure 3B,
α=1
column). In fact, that appears to be the most challenging condition for all approaches to make the necessary rejections. Our approach maintains the best performance in that instance.

We next demonstrate the application of MODIMA in two empirical examples.

Antibiotics have undoubtedly provided remarkable public health benefits in the last century. During that same time span, we see a marked increase in antibiotics use across many populations [33]. Furthermore, we see the largest use of antibacterial agents within the animal farming industry, often exclusively used in low doses to stimulate weight gain in farm animals [34]. There is growing concern about the effects from the long-term use of antibiotics and antibacterial agents [35,36]. Here, we build on the evidence on phenotypic and microbial responses to early-life subtherapeutic antibiotic treatment using murine models expanding on findings presented by Cho et al. [37].

A growing body of evidence suggests that diet influences the compositional diversity of gut bacteria [8]. We also see an association between changes in gut bacteria diversity and human health, such as obesity [41]. Through a study of diet and 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fecal samples, Wu et al. (2011) reported that long-term diet was strongly associated with enterotype clustering [42]; here, we briefly describe their methods. Healthy human subjects (n = 98) were enrolled in a cross-sectional study where long-term diet information was collected using self-reported questionnaires assessing usual dietary composition over the preceding year. Diet information was subsequently converted to a list of 214 nutrient categories and their corresponding intake amounts. Stool samples were collected, frozen immediately (−80 °C), processed using MoBio PowerSoil kits, amplified V1–V2 region primers targeting bacterial 16S genes, and sequenced using 454/Roche. Sequences were denoised using QIIME pipeline [39] following default settings. Other demographic information including body mass index (BMI) was collected upon enrollment. Weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances for microbial communities were calculated and used for downstream analyses.

Data and analysis for this application are available at https://github.com/Alekseyenko/MODIMA.

In this article, we developed a framework for multivariate omnibus distance mediation analysis (MODIMA). Although the proposed methods have wide applications to various data types, we specifically showed their robustness in high-dimensional settings by applying them to novel and previously published microbiome data. In simulations, we showed that our method to detect mediation under various scenarios is more powerful than previously published work. Simulations showed that MODIMA holds empirical type I error rates at the desired nominal significance level under the multiple mediator case.

Omnibus mediation analysis with ’omics-sized mediators is the first step towards enabling top-down approaches in genomic data. As opposed to the more widely used methods that integrate the univariate signals of individual measurements of microbes, gene expression, or genetic variants, the top-down approach starts with the collective effect of those and prunes the individual measurements down to a small set of most important ones. The significance of this approach is that top-down thinking allows for capturing effects, such as epistasis and otherwise complexly intertwined relationships. We envision that future versions of the omnibus mediation approach of this paper and of alternative approaches will allow to assign importance to components in addition to assessing the overall effect of the entire collection.
