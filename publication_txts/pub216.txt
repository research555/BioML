Early life determinants induce sustainable changes in the gut microbiome of six-year-old children

While the association between early life determinants and the development of the gut microbiome composition in infancy has been widely investigated, a potential persistent influence of early life determinants on the gut microbial community after its stabilization at later childhood remains largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to identify the association between several early life determinants and the gut microbiome composition in six-year-old children from the LISA birth cohort. A total number of 166 fecal samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene-based barcoding to assess bacterial diversity pattern. The bacterial profiles were investigated for their association with maternal smoking during pregnancy, mode of delivery, breastfeeding, antibiotic treatment between one and two years of age, gender and socioeconomic status (SES). While alpha and beta diversity of the infants’ gut microbiome remained unaffected, amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) annotated to Firmicutes and Actinobacteria responded to early life determinants, mostly to feeding practice and antibiotics use. ASVs associated to Bacteriodetes remained unaffected. Our findings indicate that early life determinants could have a long-term sustainable effect on the gut microflora of six-year-old children, however, associations with early life determinates are weaker than reported for infants.

The human gut microbiome triggers many functions that are essential for our health and wellbeing, including education of the immune system, formation of a barrier against pathogens and digestion of indigestible nutrients1,2. Not surprisingly, changes in the gut microbiome are associated with the development of diseases related to acute and chronic inflammation, allergy or immune dysregulation3–5. As consequence, the gut microbiome could be a potential target of new preventive therapeutic strategies. Thus, understanding the factors that induce a dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is essential to improve human health.

Due to the importance of the gut microbiome for human health, there is a strong need to develop strategies for a well-controlled development of the gut microbiome during childhood. To achieve this goal a detailed understanding of the long-term impact of early life determinants on the gut microbiome composition is required. However, most studies so far focused only on early infancy7–9,12 and data on long-term development of the gut microbiome during childhood are missing. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of early life determinants, which have been related to later health (maternal smoking during pregnancy, mode of delivery, breastfeeding, antibiotics treatment in infancy, gender and socioeconomic status (SES)) on the long-term development of the gut microbiome during childhood and focused on six-year-old children of a large birth cohort follow-up which was established to investigate effects of lifestyle factors on the development of immune system and allergies in Germany.

The analyzed samples comprised 44% (n = 73) females. 71% (n = 111) of the children were exclusively breastfed (eBF) for at least four months. 16% (n = 27) of the children were delivered by C-section and 51% (n = 84) of the children were treated with antibiotics (AB) between the age of one and two years. 11% (n = 18) of the mothers smoked during pregnancy. 66% (n = 109) of the mothers had a high socioeconomic status (SES). To determine the representativeness of these samples for the LISA study population the analyzed subset and the remaining LISA birth cohort from the Munich study center were compared and did not show any significant differences regarding the early life determinants and potential confounding factors (S2 data). Thus, we assume that the analyzed subjects are representative of the entire cohort.

A total of 18,599,243 raw reads were obtained. After quality filtering and chimera removal via DADA2 5,185,163 high-quality partial 16S rRNA gene sequences remained which were assigned to 4,888 unique amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). To exclude potential contaminants, all 15 ASVs occurring in extraction and PCR no template controls were removed from the dataset. To compare samples without statistical bias, subsampling with 4918 reads was performed, reflecting the lowest read number obtained per sample. Rarefaction analysis indicated diversity coverage of >99% (S3 data) and consequently an adequate sampling depth for further analysis. Alpha diversity of the gut microbiome for each early life determinant subgroup was determined by calculating richness, evenness, Shannon and Simpson index. Overall, none of the diversity indices was significantly affected by early life determinants (except exclusively breastfeeding which significantly decreased evenness, p = 0.047) (Table 1). Further multivariate analysis of variance based on Yue Clayton dissimilarity, Euclidean distance of Hellinger transformed data, Jaccard distance, Bray-Curtis distance and both weighted and unweighted Unifrac distance showed that none of the early life determinants significantly influenced the beta diversity of the gut microbiome composition (Fig. 1, showing PCoA of weighted Unifrac distance as example).

As expected the predominant bacterial phyla in all samples were Firmicutes (57.4%), Bacteroidetes (30.1%), Verrucomicrobia (4.6%), Actinobacteria (4.5%) and Proteobacteria (3.1%). Out of the total 225 bacterial genera detected, 23 genera showed relative abundance levels >1%. Five of these 23 genera were significantly influenced by early life determinants, mainly by antibiotics (AB) use and feeding practice (Fig. 2, S5 data). Interestingly, only genera belonging to Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were affected while the other phyla showed no response. This might explain why beta diversity was not significantly impacted by the early life determinants under investigation.

Members of Christensenellaceae_R7_group, accounting for 4.1% of Firmicutes, were represented by 122 ASVs, with two ASVs comprising 62.0% of Christensenellaceae_R7_group-related reads (S4 data). Whereas ASV40 did not respond to lifestyle factors, ASV24 was positively affected by eBF (1.2% vs. 0.6% of total reads) and high SES (1.9% vs. 0.5%). Similar responses towards eBF and SES were observed at genus level (Fig. 2, S5 data).

Although numerous studies investigated the impact of different lifestyle factors on the gut microbiome in early infancy7–9,12, knowledge on sustainable effects up to six years is still missing. This study focused on long-term effects of selected early life determinants (maternal smoking during pregnancy, mode of delivery, breastfeeding, antibiotics treatment during early infancy, gender and socioeconomic status) on the bacterial community structure of the gut microbiome of six-year-old children during the LISA birth cohort follow-up. The described overall composition of the gut microbiome at phylum level was comparable to the composition reported in a study where the gut microbiome of European children in the age of one to six years was analyzed13. The proportions for the most abundant phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, were similar to the results in the present study.

However, this observational study allows only to report correlations and to indicate specific organisms which might be relevant for later health and thereby contribute to an early detection of populations at risk. The identification of underlying mechanisms is beyond the scope of the present study and requires well designed and controlled animal studies, or a metagenomic approach considering the host’s phenotype.

Our findings indicate that early life determinants could have a long-term sustainable effect on the gut microflora of six-year-old children, but associations are weaker than reported for infants. No significant effects of early life determinants on the overall composition of the gut microbiome (alpha and beta diversity) were observed. Surprisingly, gut microbes that are often considered as beneficial like Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium were unaltered or even positively affected by less breastfeeding or antibiotics use. This indicates that microbial responses are far more on the level of species or even ecotypes while the level of genera and families is simply too diverse to predict common response pattern towards early life determinants. Therefore, further research is needed to explore the association between early life determinants and lasting changes of the gut microbiome composition including levels beyond genera and families. Second, a detailed understanding how changes of the host’s microbiome affect the education of immune responses in early life is required. Finally, a causal relationship with health outcomes such as allergies or asthma needs to be proven. This information can then be utilized to develop preventative or other health promotion strategies which beneficially shape the gut microbiota composition, such as through pro- or prebiotics to increase the abundance of certain species, thereby mitigating the negative effect of lifestyle factors.

The present study is based on the LISA (Influence of Life-style factors on the development of the Immune System and Allergies in East and West Germany) birth cohort. Subjects of the LISA birth cohort study were recruited from 1997 to 1999 in four regions of Germany (n = 3,097). Recruitment and exclusion criteria have been described in previous publications33,34. The LISA study has been conducted in line with the national research regulations in place at the time of data collection and was approved by local ethics committees (Bavarian General Medical Council, University of Leipzig, and the Medical Council of North Rhine-Westphalia). Written informed consent was obtained from all parents or legal guardians.

Stool samples from 166 six-year-old children from the Munich study center were collected during the follow-up in 2003 to 2005. Only participants who attended the physical examination in the study center and completed all questionnaires up to the 6-year follow-up were included. Stool samples were collected at home with sampling kits provided to the families during the physical examination. The samples were delivered immediately to the study center and frozen at −20 °C. After completion of the sampling period, the samples were transferred and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Information on early life determinants and potential confounding factors were collected from questionnaires administered to the parents. In total, six factors were analyzed in this study. The four early life determinants included in this study were maternal smoking during pregnancy, mode of delivery, exclusive breastfeeding (eBF) for at least four months and antibiotics (AB) treatment in early life (during one to two years of age), while two potential confounding factors were gender and socioeconomic status (SES; using maternal level of education as a proxy). A detailed description of determinant assessment is given in the Supplement (S1 data).

Approximately 125 mg fecal sample was used for DNA extraction using the QIAMP® Power Fecal DNA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Potential DNA contaminants in the extraction kit were analyzed by including negative extraction controls using water instead of fecal material for extraction. The quantity of the extracted DNA was measured using the Quant-iT Picogreen kit (Thermofisher, Waltham, USA). The V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was used as target for amplification. The PCR was performed using the NEBNext® high fidelity polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA) and primer pair S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17, 5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′, and S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21, 5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-335, in a total volume of 25 µl (10 ng DNA template, 12.5 µl polymerase, 0.5 pmol of each primer pair). PCR conditions were 30 s at 98 °C; 25 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 30 s at 72 °C; 5 min 72 °C. PCR products were qualified using gel electrophoresis and purified using Agencourt AMPure® XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, US). The DNA concentration was measured as described above and the quality was checked using a Fragment Analyzer™ (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Inc., Ankeny, USA). The subsequent indexing PCR was performed using the Nextera XT Index Kit v2 (Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA, US) and the NEBNext® high fidelity polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA) in a total volume of 25 µl (10 ng DNA template, 12.5 µl polymerase, 2.5 µl of each index) and the following PCR conditions: 30 s at 98 °C; 8 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 30 s at 72 °C; 5 min 72 °C. Indexing PCR products were purified and quantified as described above and pooled in an equimolar ratio of 4 nM. Sequencing was performed using an Illumina Miseq platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, USA) with Reagent Kit v3 (600 cycles). The nucleotide sequence data obtained in this study can be provided to interested researchers by the corresponding author upon reasonable request, provided the release is consistent with the consent given by the LISA study participants. Ethical approval might be obtained for the release and a data transfer agreement from the legal department of the Helmholtz Zentrum München must be accepted.

Sequences were analyzed using the QIIME 2 software package release 2017.1136 with default parameters. FASTQ files were trimmed and merged with a minimum read length of 50 and minimum Phred score of 15 using AdapterRemoval37. Quality control was done using the QIIME 2 plugin DADA238 by removing 10 bp n-terminally and truncating the reads at position 280 (forward) and 220 (reverse), respectively, resulting in unique amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). ASVs are biological sequences discriminated from errors, allowing the detection of single-nucleotide differences over the sequenced gene. The ASV method has demonstrated a better specificity and sensitivity than OTU based methods, which cluster sequencing reads according a fixed dissimilarity threshold39. For taxonomic analysis, Naive Bayes classifier was pre-trained on the SILVA_132_QIIME release 99% using the primer pair S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17/S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21. To exclude potential contamination, ASVs occurring in extraction control and PCR no template control samples (15 ASVs in total) were removed from dataset.

All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.5.0 (https://www.R-project.org). The analyzed subsample set (n = 166) was compared to the total Munich cohort (n = 1298) to confirm the representativeness of the data set using a Fisher’s exact test. Species evenness and within species diversity were measured using Pielou evenness40, Shannon diversity and Simpson’s diversity index41. Species richness was evaluated based on the number of observed ASVs38. Statistical analysis of the gut microbiome composition was done using either the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple comparisons and p-value correction by the Benjamini-Hochberg method or, when homogeneity of variance was given, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA, Adonis function) based on Yue Clayton dissimilarity, Euclidean distances of Hellinger transformed data, Jaccard distance, Bray-Curtis distance and both weighted and unweighted Unifrac distance. Additionally, a linear mixed model was calculated to test for significant effects among single taxa (including p value correction for multiple testing by Bonferroni method). The following R packages were used for analyses and visualization: ade4, agricolae, cluster, ggplot2, gridExtra, lme4, mass, plyr, qiime2R, reshape2, tidyverse and vegan.
